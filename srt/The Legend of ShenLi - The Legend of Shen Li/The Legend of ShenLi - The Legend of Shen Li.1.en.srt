=Episode 1=

3
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:45,104
(Lunar New Year's Eve)

4
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,827
The fireworks are so pretty.

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,344
So pretty!

6
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:08,107
It's my turn!

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,384
A dud.

8
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,107
She set off a dud.

9
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,786
- A dud.
- A dud.

10
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,467
She set off a dud.

11
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:22,992
A dud.

12
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:27,586
- A dud.
- A dud.

13
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:28,946
A dud.

14
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,640
Let's go.

15
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,666
Let's light the lanterns.

16
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,866
Those lanterns look amazing.

17
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:09,268
By decree of Her Holiness,

18
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:10,908
come with us now, Lord Bicang.

19
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,392
I won't go back.

20
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,427
No one can make me.

21
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,147
Her Holiness has agreed

22
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:19,248
to your political marriage

23
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:20,304
with the Divine Realm.

24
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:21,468
Please don't act willfully.

25
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,427
I'm Lord Bicang of the Immortal Realm.

26
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,707
I will not marry that fickle loser.

27
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,720
General Zhufei.

28
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,347
There's no way I'm marrying him.

29
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,668
Forgive us, Your Lordship.

30
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:38,388
You dare to stop me?

31
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:39,908
Impressive.

32
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:41,936
Very well.

33
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:43,147
Bring it on.

34
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,627
Mofang, stay calm.

35
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,868
Please come with us, Your Lordship.

36
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,428
Don't give us a hard time.

37
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,448
Are you done?

38
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,504
Step aside!

39
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,747
You're killing me.

40
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,408
This firework is so pretty.

41
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,347
So pretty!

42
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,388
What are you doing?

43
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,448
Trying to scare me?

44
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,152
Mofang, don't be impulsive.

45
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,627
Don't hurt Her Lordship.

46
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,128
My Lord.

47
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:55,280
That's all I can do for you.

48
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,488
Take care.

49
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:11,920
(Good for you.)

50
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,712
(Very loyal.)

51
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,507
(That's my subordinate.)

52
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,944
Your Lordship!

53
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:43,388
Mofang!

54
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:44,668
How can you hurt Her Lordship?

55
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:06,960
Something is wrong.

56
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,788
(Qingsheng City, Mortal Realm)

57
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:34,800
Here you are.

58
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:36,400
See you around.

59
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:44,400
Here you go.

60
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,600
Her Lordship seems to have fallen here.

61
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,624
Listen.

62
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:50,067
You search to the east. I'll go west.

63
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,468
Let's meet here in an hour.

64
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,388
- I've packed it for you.
- Here you are.

65
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:05,392
Please try it.

66
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,016
See you around.

67
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,348
Would you like a chicken?

68
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:23,536
Which one?

69
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:25,328
This one is quite special.

70
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,148
It's a bit ugly.

71
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:28,507
I caught it on the mountain yesterday.

72
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,348
The tail feathers are burnt.

73
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,307
Get a better one.

74
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,064
No need.

75
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,088
I want this one.

76
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,307
Okay, I'll give you a discount.

77
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,216
No need.

78
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,808
It's worth the price.

79
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:43,504
It would be upset

80
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,360
if it's sold at a bargain.

81
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,708
It's just a chicken.

82
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:30,828
You butcher.

83
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,187
Let go of me.

84
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,664
Let go.

85
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,456
Stop pulling.

86
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,024
Stop.

87
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,344
You woke up?

88
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:45,264
I thought you were going to die.

89
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:46,547
Cluck Cluck.

90
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,080
- Come and eat.
- (Why do I sound like this?)

91
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:53,872
How dare you!

92
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:57,148
I am the formidable lord
of the Immortal Realm,

93
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,896
who pacifies wars
with my silver spear in hand.

94
00:10:58,896 --> 00:10:59,920
No one dares

95
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,987
to disrespect me.

96
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,800
How dare you, a mortal,

97
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:05,067
treat me like a fowl?

98
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:06,736
This is unacceptable!

99
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:14,480
No hurry.

100
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,067
There's still plenty here.

101
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,496
Where is my spiritual power?

102
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:26,388
Who needs your food?

103
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,307
Forget it then.

104
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,744
Let's take a bath first.

105
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:37,840
Who's taking a bath?

106
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:40,688
Don't touch me.

107
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:41,867
What are you doing?

108
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,120
You! How dare you!

109
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,176
Why are you poking me?

110
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,264
How dare you!

111
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,067
Do it again and see what happens.

112
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,148
Time to take a bath.

113
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,616
Help...

114
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,816
I can't drink anymore.

115
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,656
I really can't...

116
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,547
Not great with water.

117
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:10,867
Is it drowning?

118
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:29,872
So much water...

119
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,176
Keep breathing.

120
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:33,520
Remember,

121
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,576
you won't die as long as

122
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:36,368
you keep breathing.

123
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,107
Easier said than done.

124
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:40,427
This evil man

125
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,667
is torturing me on purpose.

126
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,788
I'll get even with you

127
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:45,627
once I recover.

128
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,708
One must be polite.

129
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,128
My name is Xingyun.

130
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,507
I don't go by "evil man".

131
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,627
Poor swimmer.

132
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:37,107
(Now that I look at him,)

133
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:40,148
(there are hints
of indifference and holiness.)

134
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:50,832
Time for medicine.

135
00:13:58,064 --> 00:13:59,152
My feet got numb.

136
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:08,148
(I was mistaken.)

137
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:10,148
(He is totally ordinary.)

138
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:23,388
(The little torment actually)

139
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:25,348
(helped me regain strength.)

140
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:28,208
(Not bad.)

141
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,672
(No.)

142
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,268
(Still no spiritual power.)

143
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,908
(I knew I couldn't)

144
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:43,948
(get it back so fast.)

145
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:45,936
(But it may be good.)

146
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,828
(The Immortal Realm
can't detect my presence.)

147
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,948
(But it's only a matter of time)

148
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,948
(before Her Holiness finds me.)

149
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:54,512
(If I haven't regained)

150
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:56,067
(my spiritual power by then...)

151
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:57,808
Cluck Cluck.

152
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:02,992
Food is ready.

153
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:05,424
(As if I care.)

154
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,360
Come on.

155
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:14,928
(This is awkward.)

156
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:23,632
Put it here.

157
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,000
Hurry up.

158
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:35,667
(Why is there
a faint scent of medicine?)

159
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,388
(Lips turning black.)

160
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,427
(Slight dark circles.)

161
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:41,712
(Signs of a short lifespan.)

162
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,348
(So he's a sickly fella.)

163
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,828
(Well, well.)

164
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:48,880
(This mortal
has seen me as an underdog.)

165
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,468
(But he won't live long.)

166
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:52,656
(He will die and forget everything.)

167
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:53,828
(And I)

168
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,788
(will still be
the impeccable Lord Bicang.)

169
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,344
(I am still flawless.)

170
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,104
(Very good.)

171
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:03,268
The feather...

172
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:04,368
How dare you!

173
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,788
(It smells quite nice.)

174
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,352
(Let me try it.)

175
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,936
(This...)

176
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,344
(This pastry)

177
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,688
(is way too tasty.)

178
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
(So tasty.)

179
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:31,708
(It's too good to be true.)

180
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:39,888
(Not bad.)

181
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,000
How dare you!

182
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,312
You're looking down at me.

183
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,872
Everyone admires and respects me

184
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,148
in the Immortal Realm.

185
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:48,348
Men shiver when they

186
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:49,360
see me passing by.

187
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,536
Yet he dares to look down at me.

188
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:54,187
Never mind.

189
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,144
Considering that he's a fine chef,

190
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,544
I'll let him off.

191
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
That's it?

192
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,080
Get me more.

193
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:10,832
Hurry up.

194
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:11,952
Get going.

195
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,936
That's all

196
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,280
I made today.

197
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,748
I'll make some more another day.

198
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:18,800
How dare you!

199
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,868
You think you can

200
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,008
brush me off like that?

201
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:22,948
You should have made some more.

202
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:24,592
I should head out now.

203
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:26,352
Cluck Cluck.

204
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,464
Guard the place.

205
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,320
I have a lot to sell, myself.

206
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:32,432
(Sell himself?)

207
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,628
(In broad daylight,)

208
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:35,628
(a fine young man like him)

209
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:37,348
(chooses to)

210
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:39,708
(make a living by selling himself?)

211
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,336
(What a shame.)

212
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:45,424
(It's dangerous here.)

213
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:47,152
(I must leave.)

214
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,424
(Bad luck.)

215
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:53,787
(I can't even fly away)

216
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,187
(without spiritual power.)

217
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:58,960
(Burglar!)

218
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,147
(A clumsy burglar.)

219
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,547
(She's only)

220
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,547
(hurting herself.)

221
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,948
(Let me see
what you're trying to steal.)

222
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,787
(So she's not a burglar)

223
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:25,787
(but the River Snail Maiden.)

224
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:28,464
(For that guy?)

225
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:32,267
(So diligent.)

226
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:34,896
(She's a good girl.)

227
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:41,187
(Still here?)

228
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,427
What should I do?

229
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,027
How am I going to live if I can't

230
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,472
see Xingyun again?

231
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:49,988
(So she's into that sickly fella.)

232
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:52,147
(I'll let her be.)

233
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:57,427
Why is Xingyun

234
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:00,208
keeping such a fat chicken?

235
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,228
(Is she talking about me?)

236
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,828
I might as well cook it for him.

237
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:03,948
(Does she hear herself?)

238
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,576
Stay away from me!

239
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,667
(Oh no.)

240
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,912
(I have no spiritual power.)

241
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:10,147
(I'm doomed)

242
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,280
(if I get stewed.)

243
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,488
(That was close.)

244
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:19,948
S-Stay back.

245
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,136
Stay back.

246
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,456
Stop running.

247
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:26,988
I give up, okay?

248
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,432
I'm not stupid.

249
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:29,468
Anyone would run.

250
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,864
- Listen.
- Stay back.

251
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:32,688
- Let's talk.
- That's about enough.

252
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:33,808
Don't run.

253
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:35,376
Tell me.

254
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,944
How do I

255
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,192
catch a chicken?

256
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:47,632
(Oh no.)

257
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,027
(Today, I finally got a taste)

258
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,184
(of the sorrow)

259
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:56,667
(of a powerless victim.)

260
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,108
(I, Lord ShenLi, hereby make an oath.)

261
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,267
Behave.

262
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:07,427
(A blood oath.)

263
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,168
(If I get stewed today,)

264
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,448
(I shall fight my way)

265
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:12,508
(to heaven to make it even)

266
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,067
(with that heedless god)

267
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,828
(who assigned my marriage!)

268
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:21,488
What are you doing?

269
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,344
Xingyun.

270
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:24,708
I just came to see you.

271
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,547
And I found

272
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,027
this plump chicken.

273
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,067
You know what?

274
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,427
You must stew it today.

275
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:31,427
Or it won't taste good.

276
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:33,520
You can't cook it.

277
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,152
What took you so long?

278
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:36,912
Thank goodness.

279
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:38,508
I almost got cooked.

280
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm sorry. I...

281
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,588
I just wanted to leave you something

282
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:43,988
before I go.

283
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,027
Tomorrow,

284
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:49,168
my father is taking me
down south to do business.

285
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:50,352
Perhaps,

286
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:52,628
I will never see you again.

287
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,708
But I haven't really

288
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,736
seen you much, anyway.

289
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:56,307
It's not like that.

290
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:57,667
I was seeing you every day,

291
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,508
in secret.

292
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,588
What a pity.

293
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,440
I don't think

294
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,588
I've ever seen you before.

295
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,896
(Why does he say that?)

296
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:11,952
Indeed.

297
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:14,288
Not even once.

298
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,108
Don't tell me that

299
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,600
you're here for a farewell gift.

300
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,848
(This sickly fella)

301
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,387
(sounds so mean.)

302
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:24,468
I don't have anything fancy.

303
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:27,508
If you don't mind it,

304
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,147
please accept this piece of cloth.

305
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:36,272
No need.

306
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,128
No need.

307
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,187
It's a fine piece of cloth.

308
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,868
Could you please close the door?

309
00:21:58,468 --> 00:21:59,696
The River Snail Maiden

310
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:00,752
is heartbroken.

311
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:06,187
What a nice girl.

312
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:07,216
She's a bit silly.

313
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:09,552
But she's kind-hearted.

314
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,312
How did she fall for someone

315
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:12,400
in this line of work

316
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,708
who's also cold and mean?

317
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:16,027
What line of work?

318
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,267
You just went out to sell...

319
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,320
That line of work.

320
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,027
(You caught me.)

321
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:23,440
Are you talking to me?

322
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:27,988
Can't you tell who I'm talking to?

323
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:31,984
You...

324
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,628
You, you sickly fella...

325
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:36,828
Am I hallucinating?

326
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,787
Are you really talking to me?

327
00:22:39,787 --> 00:22:41,040
That's right.

328
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,832
I am talking to you.

329
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:44,720
You could hear me all along?

330
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,776
Were you toying with me?

331
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,907
I was toying with you.

332
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,800
Also,

333
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,708
my name is Xingyun.

334
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:58,352
Remember that well.

335
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:00,304
Besides,

336
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:01,520
what's wrong with my job?

337
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,907
What's wrong with your job

338
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:05,520
or toying with me?

339
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,228
Do you have a conscience?

340
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,628
How can you say that so casually?

341
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:12,228
Are you a monster?

342
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,344
I'm only

343
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,547
doing my job and toying with you.

344
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,228
And you make it
sound like a heinous crime.

345
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:24,944
Fine.

346
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:26,224
I'll do it

347
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:27,468
behind your back next time.

348
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,096
This is infuriating.

349
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,144
The stove is on.

350
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:36,708
(This guy is sinister.)

351
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,667
(I must leave now.)

352
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,136
(Otherwise, I may end up)

353
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,468
(tortured to death.)

354
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:26,128
(I can't even fly out)

355
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:27,588
(without spiritual power.)

356
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:28,592
Cluck Cluck.

357
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
Time to eat.

358
00:24:43,787 --> 00:24:45,108
(Smells amazing.)

359
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:50,224
(Let me eat first.)

360
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,704
(Done.)

361
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,368
(I'm out of here.)

362
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,064
Come back.

363
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:08,400
What do you want?

364
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,304
Don't touch me.

365
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:20,816
Go away.

366
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,147
Don't you love sunbathing?

367
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:28,208
Why would I?

368
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:30,787
The sun is there every day.

369
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:47,056
(We're leaving...)

370
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:48,748
(We're leaving...)

371
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,307
It dried up fast today.

372
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,664
(For coughing up blood)

373
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,552
(One quarter past Wu hour,)

374
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,328
(the 15th of the 8th month, Age 20)

375
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:38,878
(Time of leaf fall)

376
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:45,067
She's good-looking.

377
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:11,468
Who covered me with a gown?

378
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:21,008
Tao.

379
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,064
Let's go.

380
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:31,696
Xingyun.

381
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:33,228
I'm here to say goodbye.

382
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,948
I'd like to have a few words with you.

383
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,104
I'm sure the south

384
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:39,787
is covered with peach blossoms now.

385
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:45,360
I am not the one.

386
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:50,672
(He's so cold and distant.)

387
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,907
I'm never coming back here

388
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,348
and our paths won't cross again.

389
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:58,128
Take care.

390
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:04,912
(Great opportunity.)

391
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:19,024
(I'm out of here.)

392
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:46,768
(Hurry...)

393
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:54,160
(I have to hide.)

394
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:57,968
(Wait...)

395
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,728
(Strange.)

396
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,296
(I regained)

397
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:03,708
(so much stamina overnight?)

398
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,387
(Is that courtyard filled with)

399
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:07,408
(spiritual energy?)

400
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,468
(Or it has something)

401
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,824
(to do with the food
that sickly fella makes.)

402
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:13,328
(Tasty pastries.)

403
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:14,387
(Amazing risotto.)

404
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:22,108
Weird chicken.

405
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,144
My chicken.

406
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,296
Move!

407
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:41,267
I swear I'll catch you.

408
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:44,816
Hold it tight.

409
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,816
Catch it.

410
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,108
Don't let it get away.

411
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:57,200
Don't move.

412
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,048
Don't let it run away.

413
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:07,088
Catch it!

414
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:09,296
Move!

415
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:12,368
Caught it.

416
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,784
Slowly.

417
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:18,544
Careful, slowly.

418
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:19,568
Careful.

419
00:32:19,568 --> 00:32:20,592
Slowly.

420
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:21,616
Got it!

421
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:26,448
I got you!

422
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,427
Chicken soup tonight.

423
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:30,224
Soup for dinner, okay?

424
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,828
Let me make soup for my husband.

425
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,427
That won't do.

426
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:34,576
Get lost!

427
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:35,828
I am a phoenix!

428
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:37,488
Stop trying to stew me.

429
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,547
How can you talk about

430
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,267
killing me so casually?

431
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:41,307
Cluck cluck, shut up.

432
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,016
It flew away.

433
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:49,988
My chicken!

434
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:51,387
Get it back.

435
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,616
