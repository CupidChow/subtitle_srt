1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Boys now

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,700
you're here.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,820
Sunny trÃ¤ perd situation

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,180
The guy is apart of two men

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,820
what had happened?

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,260
The people are too boring

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260
I'm so sleepy. I'm having a brain hemorrhage.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,260
I agree.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,260
Let's sort out the things one by one.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
It's getting worse if we forget things.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,260
I agree.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,260
It's not a terrible thing.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,260
You forgot what you forgot.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,260
You forget even what you forgot.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,260
You don't remember anything.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,260
That's terrible.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,260
That's not true.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,260
That's terrible.

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,260
Let's take it one by one.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,260
That's right.

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
Your father was fine.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,260
He was fine.

23
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,260
He was lying.

24
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,260
He was lying.

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
He was called by his mother.

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
He was having a love-hate relationship with his mother.

27
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
That's terrible.

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,260
He was pretending to be his lover.

29
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,260
He was pretending to be his lover, but his parents were fine.

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,260
That's right.

31
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,260
He was fine.

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,260
I bought you a souvenir.

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,260
Thank you.

34
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
Thank you.

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
This is delicious.

36
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
I love it.

37
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
It's cute.

38
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,260
I'm glad he was fine.

39
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,260
I thought he was his parents before he became a director.

40
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
He was getting old.

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,260
I thought he would come to a future that was not so far from a lie.

42
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
That's right.

43
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Parents of our generation are worried about their daughters like us.

44
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Parents are parents, so I think they feel sorry for their daughters.

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,260
That's right.

46
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,260
I'll tell you something.

47
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
I'll forget it.

48
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
What is it?

49
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
I'll tell you when I remember.

50
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,260
When my father died, you came to Shodo Island.

51
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
That's right.

52
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,260
Thank you for that day.

53
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
It's too late.

54
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,260
When I saw your faces, I was really happy.

55
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
You said it.

56
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
That's right.

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,260
Of course.

58
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,260
You're wearing a V-sign.

59
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,260
I was relieved.

60
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,260
I'm sorry, but I'm crying.

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,260
I'm a grandmother.

62
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,260
You're wearing a lot of clothes.

63
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,260
I'm worried about Chiyaki and Keiko.

64
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,260
I can't do it.

65
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
Why are you looking at me like that?

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
I might look at you.

67
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,260
I don't like the end.

68
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,260
I don't like the end.

69
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
I don't like the end.

70
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
I don't like the end.

71
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,260
I don't like it.

72
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,260
I'm lonely.

73
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,260
Your mother is working with her neighbors.

74
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
It's 10,000 yen a year.

75
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
There are quite a few people.

76
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,260
I asked her what she used her money for.

77
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
She said she didn't use it.

78
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
I asked her what it was.

79
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,260
She said she could get the last survivor's full price.

80
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,260
That's amazing.

81
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,260
I'll survive until I'm three.

82
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
It's over 10 million yen.

84
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
It looks fun.

85
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
It's wonderful.

86
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
You'll meet up with them later, right?

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Yes, I will meet up with Eri and Kintaro.

88
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
I will measure the activity of the scene.

89
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,260
That's amazing.

90
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,260
I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,260
You don't listen to your father at all.

92
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,260
It's not like that.

93
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,260
You're like a good young man.

94
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Good young man.

95
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,260
When Mr. Erina introduced Yuto, he said,

96
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm in love with you now.

97
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
I was so nervous.

98
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,260
I was so nervous that I stopped time and kissed you.

99
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Thank you.

100
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,260
To be honest, I was a little nervous, too.

101
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,260
I was nervous.

102
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
Really?

103
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,260
I was nervous.

104
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,260
It was a good scene.

105
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,260
I feel like I'm going to write that scene in a script someday.

106
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,260
I've already written the script for the miso soup.

107
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,260
Miso?

108
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Yes, miso soup is like a memo for the scriptwriter.

109
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,260
I write down what my heart moved.

110
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,260
The feelings and words I felt at that time will be released like miso someday.

111
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,260
I'm trying to tie myself up in a different shape.

112
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
I see.

113
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
It's not that time.

114
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,260
You're going to release it and tie yourself up.

115
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
You're a good girl.

116
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Thank you.

117
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
I'll try it.

118
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
Nori is coming soon.

119
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Hello.

120
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
Hello.

121
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,260
Are you a man?

122
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
Are you a couple?

123
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
I'm coming soon.

124
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
I understand.

125
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
I'll be waiting.

126
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
Please wait.

127
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm coming.

128
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Nori.

129
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
What?

130
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,260
I'm not complaining.

131
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,260
I don't know if you're happy to hear it from your brother.

132
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,260
You're blushing.

133
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
I'm blushing.

134
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Why are you blushing?

135
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm blushing.

136
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
Everyone says I'm beautiful.

137
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
I wonder if that's true.

138
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
I'm beautiful.

139
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
I was a high-potential person.

140
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I'm beautiful.

141
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Are you okay?

142
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Hello.

143
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Hello.

144
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
I'm glad you're here.

145
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
Chiaki called me.

146
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
I'll borrow Tomomi.

147
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
Please take care of the child.

148
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
You're a man.

149
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,260
You're like Chiaki.

150
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm glad to meet you.

151
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
I haven't seen you in a long time.

152
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
Is it a girl's meeting?

153
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
I'm looking forward to it.

154
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
Thank you for waiting.

155
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
Hello.

156
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Let's go.

157
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
Is your brother coming?

158
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,260
I'm not going.

159
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
I don't want to.

160
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,260
I'm sorry to borrow this place for a magazine shoot.

161
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Please.

162
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
I'll pay you.

163
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Please say OK.

164
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
I said I was looking forward to it.

165
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
I'm counting on you.

166
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
Yes.

167
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,260
I'm rooting for you from afar.

168
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,260
I know.

169
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I'm in trouble.

170
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I'm living a private life.

171
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,260
I can't shoot a magazine shoot.

172
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
My setting is Chiaki.

173
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Really?

174
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,260
I'm going to spend the night with him.

175
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
What?

176
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
What is this place?

177
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Let's go.

178
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,260
Is it open?

179
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,260
I'm going.

180
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
Don't drink too much.

181
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm going.

182
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
I'm going.

183
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm coming.

184
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
There is a girl named Itsuko.

185
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Please tell Chiaki to come.

186
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
I'm sorry.

187
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm not good at it.

188
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Let's go.

189
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Let's go.

190
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
I'm going.

191
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
I'm going.

192
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I don't know what it is, but there are eight famous women in my house.

193
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,260
What is this?

194
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,260
I think it's a life of each person, but let's have fun today.

195
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Cheers.

196
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
I'm sorry.

197
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
I'm drinking.

198
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
It's delicious.

199
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Welcome.

200
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm sorry for the sudden change of location.

201
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
No.

202
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
Ta-da.

203
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
It's amazing.

204
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
I brought a special gift.

205
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,260
When I came here, I was about to kill you.

206
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm trying to protect you.

207
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Thank you.

208
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
I'm glad you're safe.

209
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
It's exciting.

210
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
This is today's BGM.

211
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
Please sit down.

212
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Can I help you?

213
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
It's okay.

214
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
I'll help you a little.

215
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm already doing it.

216
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Please sit down.

217
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
I'm going to be dragged.

218
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Let's be dragged today.

219
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
That's great.

220
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,260
I'm walking because I know it's not a joke

221
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I don't think I can say it with a hurtful face

222
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,260
I wonder how much I can smile and overwrite

223
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,260
That's why I'm living without giving up today

224
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,260
What kind of relationship do Chiaki and Wahi Nagakura have?

225
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
I'm going to write it down.

226
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
What are you doing now?

227
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
I've never felt this before.

228
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,260
I don't think I'm really anything.

229
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Are you proposing?

230
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
I was surprised.

231
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Yoshino Chiaki and Catcher Nagakura.

232
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
I'm sorry.

233
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,260
I'm really sorry.

234
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Please don't apologize.

235
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
I was surprised.

236
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:08,260
I was surprised that the person who looked like my wife was Yoshino.

237
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,260
But that's not what Yoshino is.

238
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,260
What do you mean by that?

239
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,260
What do you mean?

240
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,260
It's hard to explain.

241
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,260
I thought it was a relationship that was like a marriage.

242
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,260
It's not like that.

243
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,260
It's not like that.

244
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Are you proposing?

245
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,260
I have a question.

247
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Go for it.

248
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,260
I'm a beginner in this group.

249
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,260
So I have a simple question.

250
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:15,260
What kind of relationship do Chiaki and Wahi Nagakura have?

251
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Relationship?

252
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
That's a good question.

253
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,260
I don't know.

254
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,260
Please give me your comments.

255
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,260
It's a strange relationship.

256
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,260
I think it's nice.

257
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,260
I understand, but I don't understand it.

258
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
That's right.

259
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Who are you imitating?

260
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,260
I don't know.

261
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
Are you dating?

262
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,260
If so, I'm not dating.

263
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,260
It's not like I'm dating or not dating.

264
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,260
If you're upset, propose to me.

265
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,260
It's nice.

266
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Marry me.

267
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,260
I don't like it.

268
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:24,260
I proposed to her a long time ago.

269
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,260
But I don't think she remembers.

270
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,260
She proposed to me once.

271
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,260
That's a lie.

272
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,260
But she doesn't remember.

273
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
It was a long time ago.

274
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,260
They were drunk and drunk.

275
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I don't think she remembers.

276
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,260
That's right.

277
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,260
It's hard to put into words.

278
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:12,260
If you ask me if I'm dating, I'll say no.

279
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
No.

280
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,260
It's not like that.

281
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:26,260
But I'm sure she's the most important person.

282
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,260
I want her to be by my side forever.

283
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,260
I want her to be happy.

284
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,260
I don't want to give a conclusion.

285
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,260
That's why I say it's fun.

286
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Do you understand that?

287
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I don't understand.

288
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,260
But I think it's mature.

289
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,260
You're mature.

290
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,260
I don't think it's a line.

291
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,260
This is delicious.

292
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,260
That's what it's like.

293
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,260
I think this is fun.

294
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,260
I think it's not fun if you make it a reality.

295
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,260
Did you understand?

296
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
I don't understand.

297
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,260
It's a line.

298
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,260
I don't understand.

299
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,260
Who is it?

300
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,260
I don't understand.

301
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Let's drink.

302
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Let's drink.

303
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Thank you.

304
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
Take care.

305
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,260
I agree with you.

306
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Yes.

307
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Would she like it?

308
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Yes

309
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,260
That scene.

310
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,260
I had a joke with this Liberal Arts Clubiger.

311
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
What do you think?

312
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,260
I think I'd take the exam.

313
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Do you hatecharged in perilsÐ½Ð¾?

314
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
I'll give it to your wife.

315
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Yes.

316
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,260
I see.

317
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,260
I think you're a little bit of a girl.

318
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
A little bit?

319
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,260
You married your first love, so you're not a girl.

320
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,260
So, I'm worried about you.

321
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,260
You've been a little bit drunk lately.

322
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Please don't get hurt.

323
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Please.

324
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Morishita, are you saying something unnecessary?

325
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
I am.

326
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,260
Please stop.

327
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,260
Yes.

328
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
Please.

329
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Yes.

330
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Please.

331
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Thank you.

332
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Thank you.

333
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
How are you feeling after that?

334
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
I'm fine.

335
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
You don't have to apologize.

337
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,260
You're happy, right?

338
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Yes.

339
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,260
I feel healthier after I came here.

340
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,260
I want to be told that I'm fine.

341
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
That's an honor.

342
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,260
I've been feeling a little sick lately.

343
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
So I came here.

344
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
Really?

345
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Doctor?

346
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Yes.

347
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,260
Can you go to the hospital with the patients?

348
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,260
There's a udon restaurant in the church.

349
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Please come in.

350
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,260
What kind of clinic is this?

351
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,260
Are you feeling unwell?

352
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,260
My heart has been pounding since that day.

353
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,260
I've been watching you and Nagakura.

354
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,260
I feel like we're connected.

355
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
We're close.

356
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Nagakura is a good guy.

357
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,260
I feel like I'm going to die.

358
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,260
But I'm having fun.

359
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,260
It's not what the doctor said.

360
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,260
But there's a good pain.

361
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,260
So I'm going to keep it going.

362
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,260
I feel like I'm in pain.

363
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
I'm not sick.

364
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:41,260
I've been thinking about the rest of my life.

365
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
That's okay.

366
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,260
But it's fun when my heart moves.

367
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:58,260
It seems that you can't cure it.

368
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Thank you.

369
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,260
It's an honor to be a Chikuchiku.

370
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,260
It's a little bit.

371
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
It's a little bit.

372
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
I dragged you into it.

378
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
It's okay.

379
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,260
It's my story.

380
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,260
Everyone made this.

381
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Thank you.

382
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,260
I was saved.

383
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
I'm happy.

384
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,260
I'm sorry to make you talk about that.

385
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,260
This is very interesting.

386
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
It's interesting.

387
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,260
I want to save the main character at least in that drama.

388
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,260
I want a bold approach.

389
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Let's do a time slip.

390
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Before my husband cheats on me.

391
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
What do you mean?

392
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,260
I'm going to do a time slip with everyone in the Sarezuma Alliance.

393
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
I understand.

394
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
You choose there.

395
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,260
I choose.

396
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
Can you kill your husband?

397
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
Yes.

398
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,260
You haven't cheated on him yet.

399
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,260
But you can kill your husband who is determined to be the future.

400
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
I see.

401
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,260
If you make a living, you cheat on him and make a child between other women.

402
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
I see.

403
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
This is difficult.

404
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,260
It's difficult.

405
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,260
Ms. Haruka of the Sarezuma Alliance.

406
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
What will you do if you are Ms. Haruka?

407
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,260
And I will kill the woman.

408
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Without hesitation.

409
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
I see.

410
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,260
You have that kind of choice.

411
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
I see.

412
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
I forgot about your existence.

414
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,260
I'm sorry to hear that you are going forward.

415
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,260
This is fun.

416
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
I'm glad.

417
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
You have to enjoy your life.

418
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,260
That's the best revenge.

419
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Which one do you want to kill?

420
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
I want to kill both.

421
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,260
This is good.

422
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,260
This is wonderful. Thank you for the food.

423
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
This is beautiful.

424
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,260
This is wonderful.

425
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,260
My sister is beautiful.

426
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
My sister is beautiful.

427
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,260
My aunt.

428
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
This is good.

429
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Please look at this.

430
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
This is good.

431
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
I admire this.

432
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Please look at this.

433
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Please look at this.

434
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
This is good.

435
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
I'll have some more.

436
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Are you okay?

437
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Please look at this.

438
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
It smells good.

439
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
It's like a cafe.

440
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,260
This is good too.

441
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
I'm home.

442
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Welcome home.

443
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Thank you for today.

444
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
Thank you for the clothes.

445
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
It's cheap.

446
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Thank you.

447
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
How was it?

448
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Are you tired?

449
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
You're tired.

450
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I don't know.

451
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,260
The interviewer said it was wonderful.

452
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
I think so.

453
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
But it wasn't me.

454
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
What do you mean?

455
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
I can't say it well.

456
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,260
My brother runs a small cafe at home.

457
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,260
My brother is a famous artist.

458
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
He is a famous artist.

459
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
He said he would take a picture here.

460
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
He said he would pretend to be at home.

461
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
He said it was wonderful.

462
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
That's not me.

463
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
He said it was wonderful at his house.

464
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
He never said that.

465
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
My husband's story.

466
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,260
My son's story.

467
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
If I tell the truth, I'll be surprised.

468
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,260
So I lied a little.

469
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
I often come to the cafe with three people.

470
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
In other words.

471
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
That's not me.

472
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
I was really lonely.

473
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
I thought...

474
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
I didn't have anything.

475
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I was sad.

476
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
I was sad.

477
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
I thought everyone was amazing.

478
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Shinpei, Erina, Chiaki.

479
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm sorry.

480
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm like an idiot.

482
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Teacher.

483
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
I'm not an idiot.

484
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
I...

485
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
I like Noriko as she is.

486
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
She's cute and cute.

487
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
I don't say that now.

488
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
What Noriko is trying to do now.

489
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,260
Model.

490
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
She's a model.

491
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
It's a job that people can see.

492
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260
So.

493
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
I don't care about who I really am.

494
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
The director often says.

495
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,260
I'm happy to be a different person.

496
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
No.

497
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
I'm not saying anything positive.

498
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,260
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Thank you.

500
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
The End

501
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
That's right. You're a Japanese.

502
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,260
Yes. It's pretty difficult.

503
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
I see.

504
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
I'm sorry for being so sudden today.

505
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
No.

506
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
What was the main topic today?

508
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
Nothing.

509
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
I just wanted to eat with you.

510
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
That's important.

511
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
I also wanted to ask you about the middle school.

512
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
So I don't want you to tell me the results.

513
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
Until my birthday.

514
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Yes.

515
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
I'm lost.

516
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Really?

517
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
Yes. I'm lost.

518
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
I'm sorry.

519
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
You came all the way here.

520
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
I guess so.

521
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
After hearing the word from the director.

522
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
I've been thinking.

523
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
I'm thinking.

524
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,260
I'm honored.

525
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
I'm mixed with the feeling of being a great person.

526
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
I've never felt this way before.

527
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
I'm grateful.

528
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,260
I mean.

529
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
It's fun.

530
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
I see Kamakura.

531
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
I think about my job differently.

532
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Really?

533
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
Yes.

534
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,260
I accept this story.

535
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,260
I refuse it.

536
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I felt the shaking of my heart.

537
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
I feel it in my heart.

538
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
I feel like I'll be able to help myself someday.

539
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Thank you very much.

540
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
I'm glad.

541
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I have to go.

543
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm glad I met you today.

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Thank you.

545
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
I'll pay for it.

546
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,260
Please.

547
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Please let me pay for it today.

548
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,260
I was late last time.

549
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
I'll pay for it today.

550
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
It's been a long time.

551
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
I'm sorry.

552
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
It's okay.

553
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,260
I'll be with you now.

554
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
No.

555
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Thank you.

556
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
I'll pay for it.

557
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
I'll pay for it.

558
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Don't worry.

559
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
I'm a ninja.

560
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,260
A ninja?

561
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,260
Be careful.

562
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Wait.

563
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
When did you get here?

564
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Today.

565
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Today?

566
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
I didn't mean it by chance.

567
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Wait.

568
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,260
Where did you hear it from?

569
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,260
I'm curious.

570
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
I'm wondering.

571
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
I'm sorry.

572
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm sorry.

573
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Last time,

574
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
I was a ninja.

575
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
I was a ninja.

576
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
I'm going to cut it and put it in a safe place.

577
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
What are you doing?

578
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
I'm going to stop it.

579
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Stop it.

580
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
I'm a grandma.

581
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
I'm with you.

582
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,260
I want you to make a machine that talks to Zakubara.

583
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
I'm sorry!

584
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Ta-da!

585
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
I'm going to

586
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,260
apologize to the CEO

587
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
through Goda Pro.

588
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
Thank you.

589
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
Good luck.

590
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Great job.

591
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,260
I forgot the receipt.

592
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
I forgot.

593
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Thank you.

594
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
Bye.

595
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Where is she?

596
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
Same.

597
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Here's your change.

598
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Wow, you're drinking.

599
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
It's been a while.

600
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
It must be good.

601
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Is it boiled?

602
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
Is this it?

603
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Yes, yes.

604
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
If it's boiled too much, the meat will be hard.

605
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,260
But if you put it on a hot white rice and put it in your mouth,

606
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
it's delicious.

607
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
What can I say?

608
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Yes, it's about my work.

609
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Yes, that's right.

610
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm sorry to make you worry.

611
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
It's mainly about Getsuko, right?

612
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Yes, I'm worried.

613
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,260
I'll do my best to make a declaration, but it's not easy.

614
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Hey, Mariko...

615
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Oh.

616
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Oh.

617
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Sakuma.

618
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Do you want to drink together, Mr. Sakuma?

619
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
No, I'm fine.

620
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Mr. Sakuma, please.

621
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,260
Thank you.

622
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
You're a good girl at first.

623
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Mr. Chiaki said that

624
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,260
he didn't like the word, empathy.

625
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
He didn't understand it well.

626
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I heard that too.

627
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,260
I heard that a lot.

628
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Mr. Chiaki, you should read books.

629
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,260
It will definitely enrich your life.

630
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Reading books, reading stories,

631
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
watching dramas, I think it's the same.

632
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,260
It means knowing a life you don't know.

633
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,260
There are many people you can't meet in your life.

634
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,260
No, actually, there are more people who don't know.

635
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
The story teaches you that.

636
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,260
It teaches you a different life from the one you don't know.

637
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
As expected of Team Yoshi's Chiaki.

638
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Chiaki history is long.

639
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
It's difficult to make a script.

640
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
I'm sorry.

641
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,260
It's difficult to make a script.

642
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
I'm...

643
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,260
I'm...

644
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,260
I think Mariko should write about herself.

645
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
Definitely.

646
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
No, no, about me?

647
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
I don't think so.

648
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Who do you think is interesting?

649
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
I don't think so.

650
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Mariko's feelings for Chiaki are like the ultimate love.

651
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
It's a love that's unchanging.

652
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
It's a love that's unchanging.

653
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
I think it's unchanging.

654
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm making love stories,

655
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
but most love stories are unchanging.

656
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Everyone wants to have unchanging love stories.

657
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Right, boss?

658
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
I want you to write about yourself.

659
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
It's cute and cute.

660
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
It may not be an upbeat change,

661
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,260
but it's the ultimate love story.

662
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
No, no, no.

663
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Who's interesting about me?

664
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Write it down!

665
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
What was that?

666
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Please write it down.

667
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
I think so too.

668
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
I want to read it and watch it.

669
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,260
I want to watch it.

670
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
It may not be rewarded,

671
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,260
but please write a love story that makes me want to cheer for you.

672
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,260
If you don't write it down, I'll take it.

673
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,260
I'll just give it a taste. Is that okay?

674
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
What are you saying?

675
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
I can't stand that.

676
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Then please write it down.

677
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Write it down.

678
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,260
The expression you see in Yoshino-san is the cutest in the world.

679
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,260
I like seeing that.

680
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Viewers, please write it down with the same feelings as me.

681
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
I'm writing it down.

682
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Sakuma-dono, I'm waiting for your ina-niwa udon.

683
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Not now.

684
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
Drink it.

685
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
I understand.

686
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
I'll write it down.

687
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I thought that even if it wasn't good as a project,

688
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,260
I would be able to write it down once,

689
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
and I felt that the day would come when it would be a plus for me.

690
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Thank you very much.

691
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
Then, I'll be rude to say this.

692
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
Thank you very much.

693
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
Is Ei-chan crying?

694
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
Why?

695
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Good work.

697
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Thank you.

698
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
What?

699
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,260
You're so drunk that you can't even talk?

700
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
That's right.

701
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
I can't afford to go out with you.

702
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
I'm the one who's going out with you.

703
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
I'm sorry.

704
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Show me.

705
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
I see.

706
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,260
You're a lot of work as a tourist ambassador.

707
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
You're not a tourist ambassador,

708
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:36,600
but a tourist

709
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,260
I'm helping you.

710
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Thank you very much.

711
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Please, after this.

712
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
It's strange, isn't it?

713
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,260
Do you understand Japanese?

714
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Yes.

715
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
I said I'd help you.

716
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
It's strange, isn't it?

717
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
It's strange, isn't it?

718
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
There are fewer people who help.

719
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Do you understand?

720
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
I'll do my best.

721
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Thank you very much.

722
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
It's strange, isn't it?

723
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm sorry.

724
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
I'm sorry.

725
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
I'm sorry.

727
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
I'm sorry.

728
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,260
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
I'm sorry.

732
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
I'm sorry.

733
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
I'm sorry.

734
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
I'm sorry.

736
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
I'm sorry.

737
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,260
I'm sorry.

738
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
I'm sorry.

740
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
I'm sorry.

742
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm sorry.

744
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
I'm sorry.

746
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
I'm sorry.

747
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,260
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
I'm sorry.

752
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,260
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,260
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
I'm sorry.

755
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
I'm sorry.

757
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
I'm sorry.

758
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
I'm sorry.

760
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
I'm sorry.

761
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
I'm sorry.

762
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
I'm sorry.

763
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,260
I'm sorry.

764
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
I'm sorry.

765
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
I'm sorry.

766
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,260
I'm sorry.

767
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
I'm sorry.

768
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,680
Apart from being very stubborn,

769
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,000
it feels like being accomplished kept on my mind,

770
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,600
but it wasn't until that I came to understand

771
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,520
I created my own way to live.

772
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,060
I took a great-to-value class

773
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,700
thatë reward and pads for giving if I won within 10

774
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,660
hours.

775
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,760
It doesn't look good at all!

776
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,660
I'm sorry.

777
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
Good luck!

778
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660
Why aren't you talking to me?

779
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,660
I was looking for it myself, and I was wondering what it looked like.

780
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,660
By the way, the black pants pocket on the right side.

781
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
There is.

782
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
I don't think I'm wrong anymore.

783
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
You're right.

784
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Nagakura is peaceful.

785
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,660
What?

786
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Nothing.

787
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,660
It's been a long time since we've been together like this.

788
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
It's been a long time.

789
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
I was also in a hurry.

790
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
Yuuka Tei.

791
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
What do you think?

792
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
What?

793
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,660
Did you get a little jealous by the appearance of Mr. Naruse?

794
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
What do you mean?

795
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,660
I was a little jealous.

796
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
Ritsuko Hayata.

797
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,660
I was a little jealous, but I was jealous.

798
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Ritsuko is cute.

799
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
That's not true.

800
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Is that so?

801
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,660
I was a little jealous, but I was jealous.

802
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Really?

803
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,660
It's true. Mr. Naruse is a wonderful person from a man's point of view.

804
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,660
Thank you. I'm a little confident.

805
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Me too.

806
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
Let's go to a lot of places.

807
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
Shall we go?

808
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
We have good sake at home.

809
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,660
That's great.

810
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,660
We have great sake.

811
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
Let's go home today.

812
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
Let's start the inspection.

813
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
Please sit here.

814
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,660
Please sit here.

815
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,660
Please take off your clothes and sleep facing up so that this side is on your head.

816
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
Good job.

817
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
Good job.

818
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,660
Mr. Shinpei Nagakura.

819
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,660
Yes.

820
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
The result of a thorough examination.

821
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,660
The death of the brain organ...

822
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,660
Tonight, I can make it to the dance.

823
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,660
Even on sad days, even in a terrible mood.

824
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,660
Tonight, I can make it to the dance.

825
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,660
Ah, if I don't give up.

826
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Tonight, I can make it to the dance.

827
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,660
Even if I can't understand it, even if we're apart.

828
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,660
Tonight, I can make it to the dance.

829
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,660
Even if I don't have anything, even if I just lose it.

830
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Tonight, I can make it to the dance.

831
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,660
Tonight, I can make it to the dance.

832
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
It's not like everything is going well.

833
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
Everyone is struggling.

834
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,660
We have to do it right.

835
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,660
It's no good.

836
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,660
We don't know each other anymore.

837
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,660
I was being tested to see if the specifications were getting bigger, but the teacher told me.

838
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
This year's number is being used.

839
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,660
30?

840
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,660
Fried chicken, ham, katsu, fried chicken, fried chicken.

841
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,660
Fried? I'll give you fried chicken.

842
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
This is the real me.

843
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,660
Even if there's something bad, make it a story.

844
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
That's why you can do something interesting.

845
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,660
And then, cheer up, Chiaki.
