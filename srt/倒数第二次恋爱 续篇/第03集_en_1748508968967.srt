1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Leica-kun!

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,220
mother!

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,800
Look for it!

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,800
That person is a devil

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,800
He makes me a slave

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,800
I am a devil

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,800
In the heat of summer

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I was in Bambaru until middle school

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
When I was doing baseball

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
I was told that I was a catcher

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
I was told that I was a doga-ben

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I like doga-ben

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I don't care

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Please continue

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Anyway, I brought the ero-phon

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,800
The ero-phon at the time was not something that was easy to get

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,800
But I don't know what the ero-phon was like at the time

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I understand that because I had a big brother

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I had a big brother and I liked a manga

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,800
I put the manga in the student bag

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I tried to take a breath and went back to the house

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I went to school the next day

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I didn't see the book

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Wait a minute

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Did you really not see it?

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I will leave it to you

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I'm sorry

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Please continue

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
The class ended

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I came home

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
I opened the door

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I saw the book on the table

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
There was a book

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
It was an ero-phon

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I went to the book

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
There were a lot of things in it

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The origami was engraved

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Like a line?

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Like a line

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Like a line

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Something like a single-track

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
I thought, what is this?

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
When I turned around, there was a mother

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
She said, sit down

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,800
My mother was a very kind person

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I didn't feel like I was angry at that time

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I was a little nervous

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
My mother said this to me

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
If you were an adult

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
It's natural to be interested in such things

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
It's not bad, it's normal

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
But the female character here

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
It's different

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I want you to know that it's a lie

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,800
I wonder if it's related to the male and female characters in the manga

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I can't say it well

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I understand

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Men make things to make men happy

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,800
So there are usually women who are shy

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
If you open the lid, you want to do that

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
It's written in such a way

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I wanted to say that it wasn't like that

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
So my mother didn't think like this

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I didn't think like this at all

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I was just wearing a shirt

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
You're so good

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I think it's hard to be good

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I don't have children

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I thought I could face my son like that

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I think you can do it if you are a good person

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I see

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
But you are a really wonderful mother

73
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Thank you

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I was hiding that book

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I was embarrassed and kind to the kind mother

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I was talking about it

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I was so happy

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I was crying

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I cried

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Then my mother

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I was thinking about it now

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I was mistaken for doing it myself

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I thought I would make my son cry

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,800
I thought I would hurt my son

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Then my mother cried

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm sorry

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm sorry

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
We are in the fifth grade

89
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
But while we were there

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
There was a picture

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I was so scared

92
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I was in the car

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I was scared of the car and the car

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I was scared of the car

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I was scared of the car

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I was scared of the car

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I was crying

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I was in the fifth grade

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I was in the fifth grade

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
What about in the middle?

101
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
There was a picture

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I was so scared

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I was in a trauma

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I was in a bad relationship with a man

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I was so good at talking about bad things

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Women are sad

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
and painful

108
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I was so happy

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I was in a bad relationship with a man

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
I was so happy

111
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I was so happy

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,000
It's impossible to attack something like that.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,800
It's impossible to twist your feelings.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,480
But isn't it like that?

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,440
If you attack a woman,

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,080
you're going to get hurt if you do something.

117
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,800
You're going to get hit, aren't you?

118
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,360
No, I'm not.

119
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,920
No, that's right.

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,200
It's basically a hit.

121
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,720
That's a long story.

122
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,320
You're going to get hit if you attack a woman.

123
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,080
But if you're in a relationship,

124
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
you shouldn't just catch it.

125
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
If you throw it, you throw it.

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
If you throw it, you take it.

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,680
It's a catchball.

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,840
People are catchballs.

129
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm a pitcher type.

130
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm going to throw it like this.

131
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm a pitcher type, but I don't control it.

132
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,920
I think I said something good just now.

133
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,160
Can I send it to you?

134
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
Who is it?

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,960
It's Mariko.

136
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,320
She's a great pitcher.

137
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
If you think about it like this,

138
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,320
for example, if you send a word like catchball with people,

139
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,320
you can drop it in the script.

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,120
It's really a talent.

141
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,680
Okay, I'm going to send it.

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Thank you for your hard work.

143
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Thank you for your sleep.

144
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,120
I'll keep it a record and let you use it.

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Mariko Heart.

146
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,520
You're being pushed.

147
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,320
That's a joke.

148
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Your voice is so loud.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Sorry.

150
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,520
Recently, I've been so kind.

151
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I bought flowers and cakes for work.

152
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
It's easy to understand.

153
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,720
Right?

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,920
I thought it was suspicious and saw it while I was sleeping.

155
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
What?

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,920
It wasn't locked?

157
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,120
It's locked, but I know it.

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,920
Hey.

159
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,520
Please don't mind me.

160
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,920
I want you to continue your story without being pushed.

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
You're being pushed.

162
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm not pushed.

163
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm being pushed.

164
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm being pushed.

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm being loved.

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,520
I'm a little bit embarrassed to talk about the flower garden.

167
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Really?

168
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm a little embarrassed.

169
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,520
It's not bad.

170
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
What?

171
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,120
It's not good.

172
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,720
I thought you'd say that.

173
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,120
But there's a story I just told you.

174
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
It's called a fall.

175
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,720
Fall?

176
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I want to hear it.

177
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,320
You want to hear it.

178
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,120
You want to hear it.

179
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Everyone cried because they were angry.

180
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,720
After that, my mother asked me what to do with this book.

181
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,920
She said she wanted to see it, so she just told me to do it.

182
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,120
That's what happened.

183
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,320
After I got used to it, I found a book.

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Noriko's room.

185
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,920
What?

186
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Wait.

187
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Why?

188
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,120
She was so moved by everyone.

189
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:43,320
She gave me a thin sheet and I was aiming for that.

190
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,520
There's a reason for Noriko's.

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,520
The title of the book is the best.

192
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,720
It's a big word.

193
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,920
Danchizuma Noriko's room.

194
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
She's a student.

195
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I want to hear it.

196
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,120
I know Noriko.

197
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,320
Noriko.

198
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,920
Noriko.

199
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,120
She's Noriko.

200
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
My sister.

201
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,720
What's she doing?

202
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Are you okay?

203
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,320
I thought you were touched by something.

204
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,720
I know.

205
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,920
You know?

206
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm worried.

207
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:37,920
I'm worried.

208
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I'm worried.

209
00:10:45,920 --> 00:11:14,120
I'm worried.

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Chiyaki, let's get married.

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,120
Let's get married.

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
I told her to do it.

213
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Please marry me.

214
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Is there anything you want to do with Noriko?

215
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Yuzuna, do you have time?

216
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,920
Yes.

217
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
I see.

218
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I don't know because I don't have kids.

219
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,520
But I'm a mother.

220
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm a middle schooler.

221
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm a middle schooler.

222
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I see.

223
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,520
You're cute.

224
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I won't say I said it.

225
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
You're so cute.

226
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,520
I thought you were talking about something.

227
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,520
But men are different.

228
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Yes.

229
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Men are different.

230
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Women are different.

231
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,520
When I was young,

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,520
I was in the drama scene.

233
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
When I was asked what I thought of,

234
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,520
I was happy to hear that.

235
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
I was happy to hear that.

236
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I was also happy to hear that.

237
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I was like,

238
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,520
I want to say my opinion.

239
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
I see.

240
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
I see.

241
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,520
I see.

242
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,520
I was a young man.

243
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I was a man in Z- Generation.

244
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
You're doing it.

245
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm doing it.

246
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,520
This is tough.

247
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Isn't it expensive to be a new director?

248
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
This is bad.

249
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
This is really tough.

250
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Let's do it.

251
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
This is not good.

252
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
What do you think?

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
I don't know when I'm on the show.

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't feel anything.

255
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,520
What do you think?

256
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,520
I have to reduce the number of sets.

257
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
I don't have the time to talk.

258
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
I see.

259
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,520
I thought so from the beginning.

260
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,520
I don't want to say it in my shoes.

261
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,520
I might have told you.

262
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
It was a little unfair.

263
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
No, it's not like that.

264
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,520
What do you mean?

265
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
The office?

266
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
The emergency room?

267
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Do you do it in the same place?

268
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Leave it to me.

269
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,520
If you have a request, I can't do it.

270
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Isn't she a treasure of TV industry?

271
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
She's great.

272
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Thank you very much.

273
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll get it right away.

274
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
I'll have a time.

275
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
I'll have a time.

276
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I have to write something more.

277
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Wait a minute.

278
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
What's wrong?

279
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Where are you?

280
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm here.

281
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm here to get the project.

282
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Yes.

283
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Can you give me a chance?

284
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,520
I've been working for over 10 years.

285
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm happy to have you as my job.

286
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I know you're working for me.

287
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm sure you'll be satisfied if you do it again.

288
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:23,520
I think it's important to work with me.

289
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Thank you.

290
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm sure you have something.

291
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,520
I want to write and do what I want to do.

292
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I want to know that.

293
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm happy to do that.

294
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

295
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,520
What's wrong?

297
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Thank you for your hard work.

298
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
It's been a long time.

299
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,520
It's been a long time.

301
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Please.

302
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
I don't want to.

303
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
I don't want to explain it to you.

304
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
I did a mistake.

306
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
You said you were a newbie.

307
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
I didn't do it.

308
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Sorry.

309
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I forgot about the problem.

310
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Don't be ridiculous.

311
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
You're a fool.

312
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,520
You said you were going to quit.

313
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,520
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,520
You're going to be a bad guy.

317
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,520
I'll do my best to help you.

318
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I'll do my best to help you.

319
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Thank you for your time.

320
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Nagakura.

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,520
You're early.

323
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
You're here.

324
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I'm glad you're here.

328
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Can you come to my house?

329
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
I have something to give you.

330
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
You're not home?

331
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Come here.

332
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Come on.

333
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Come on.

334
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Hayata.

335
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Hayata.

336
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
This is...

337
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Ichijou's house, right?

338
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes.

339
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I'm Ichijou's daughter.

340
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
What?

341
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
That's right.

342
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Are you surprised?

343
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,520
When I was in the 5th grade.

344
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I lived in Singapore when I was in the 5th grade.

345
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I couldn't come home because of the corona.

346
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Oh, really?

347
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Yes.

348
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
My husband died after that.

349
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
And...

350
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Miboujin.

351
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Here you go.

352
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I understand that you died.

354
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,520
But my husband was a bad guy.

355
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
What?

356
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,520
He was a bad guy.

357
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Can you raise the priority?

360
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Thank you.

361
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Please.

362
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Please.

364
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,520
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Thank you.

368
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Did you hurt your father?

370
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
What?

371
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
What?

372
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Did you get along well?

373
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Did you talk to him?

374
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
We talked about how we get along well.

375
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
What?

376
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Did you have a common hobby?

377
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
A common hobby?

378
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I don't think so.

379
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,520
But your father knew your taste.

380
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
My taste?

381
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Ichijou?

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
My taste?

383
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Japanese?

384
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
No.

385
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Sorry.

386
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
My taste?

387
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
My taste?

388
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I knew it.

389
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,520
My father is your father.

390
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
He's like a cat.

391
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Please accept him.

392
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
No.

393
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Ichijou?

394
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Can I ask you to open the door?

395
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Please.

396
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Ichijou?

397
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Ichijou?

398
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I don't think it means anything.

399
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I heard you were a little bit shy.

400
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Wait.

401
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
I'll take you home.

403
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
You can't take me home.

404
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I have a daughter.

405
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
I see.

406
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
That's hard.

407
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Let's do this.

408
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
If you want to read it, you can come here.

409
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
You can't come here on a Saturday.

410
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,520
That's weird.

411
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,520
That's not true.

412
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
No?

413
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
No?

414
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
You can't say that.

415
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Please calm down.

416
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,520
I know that you are a single person.

417
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,520
You brought me this kind of stuff.

418
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,520
It's weird that you brought me this.

419
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
That's enough.

420
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
You're a single person.

421
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Please take it.

422
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
I see.

423
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
You're a friend.

424
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
No.

425
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
If you say I'm a friend,

426
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,520
you'll feel like I'm requesting.

427
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
What?

428
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm just talking about the script.

429
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
So you've been doing this for your father?

430
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Yes.

431
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,520
I'll be honest.

432
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
I see.

433
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I thought you liked the beauty of the city.

436
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I see.

438
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Let's do our best.

445
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
This is the start of our second life.

446
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Yes.

447
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,520
If I can do it, why...

448
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
What?

449
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Really?

450
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Why?

451
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
What?

452
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
You said you can do it.

453
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Yes.

454
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
I'm sorry.

455
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I can do it.

456
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm sorry.

457
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,520
I'm sorry.

459
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm sorry.

460
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Thank you.

461
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Thank you for waiting.

462
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Thank you.

463
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Elena, can I have a minute?

464
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Yes.

465
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Hello.

466
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Hello. I'm Shinpei.

467
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,520
What's up?

468
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Yes.

469
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm going to check the documents tomorrow.

470
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
What?

471
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Shin, are you okay?

472
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I feel like my face is in a bad mood.

473
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
What?

474
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
My body is in a bad mood.

475
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Oh, I see.

476
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Your body is okay.

477
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Thank you.

478
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Really?

479
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Yes.

480
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Really.

481
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm sure you're okay.

482
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
It's okay.

483
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm fine.

484
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm alone at the store.

485
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm doing a good job.

486
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
I see.

487
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm going to ask you again.

488
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,520
You're not doing anything right.

489
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
No.

490
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Don't tell your brother.

491
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm worried.

492
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Can I trust you?

493
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
Yes.

494
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Okay.

495
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm sorry.

496
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Shinpei, what's wrong?

497
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I feel like meeting my family.

498
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I feel like meeting them.

499
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
What?

500
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Dad!

501
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Dad!

502
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Come on!

503
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Did you have fun?

504
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Yes.

505
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
I did it.

506
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Thank you.

507
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
You're welcome.

508
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Thank you.

509
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Thank you.

510
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
You know, Mariko,

511
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,520
you've only ever met Chiyaki.

512
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
You're good.

513
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
I want to challenge you.

514
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
I don't think so.

515
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,520
My motivation is Chiyaki.

516
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,520
I'm writing it for you.

517
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I see.

518
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
What if Chiyaki is the one who's retiring?

519
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I'll be the one to retire.

520
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,520
It doesn't make any sense.

521
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
I'll have to work hard for you.

522
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
I see.

523
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Okay.

524
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Thank you for your hard work.

525
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Thank you for your hard work.

526
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Thank you for your hard work.

527
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Thank you.

528
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Watch out.

529
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I found it.

530
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
It's okay.

531
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Please turn the brakes.

532
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,520
It's white enough to be seen.

533
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Oh.

534
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Thank you.

535
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Thank you.

536
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
You're all alone.

537
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I'll name one.

538
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I've got one more.

539
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
It's a name.

540
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Thank you.

541
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Thank you.

542
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
I've got one more.

543
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
I've got one more.

544
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Oh.

545
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
It's a warm one.

546
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Is it okay?

547
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Did you have a baseball game?

549
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I played when I was young.

550
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
You were young.

551
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,520
I had only baseball games.

552
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
I'll have it.

553
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I was a pitcher.

554
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
My team was not good, but we played baseball.

555
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,520
You're good with me.

556
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I'll have one more.

557
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I'm Narset.

558
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,520
I'm Naga Kuro.

559
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,520
I've only played a few games.

560
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
You played baseball?

561
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,520
I admire Pitcher.

562
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Really?

563
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,520
I thought Pitcher would have won my life.

564
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Why?

565
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,520
I think that my life is like a role-playing catcher.

566
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,520
I have many brothers.

567
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,520
I always think that I can win my brother's life.

568
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,520
I think that I can throw him away.

569
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,520
I feel that way even at work.

570
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Thank you.

571
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,520
It's hard to catch.

572
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,520
I have never thrown away my own thoughts.

573
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,520
I think that I can throw away my own thoughts.

574
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,520
I think that I can throw away my own thoughts.

575
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,520
I don't want to think about that for the rest of my life.

576
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,520
I don't want to think about that for the rest of my life.

577
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
I see.

578
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Can I ask you something?

579
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
What's your age?

581
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,520
I'm 63 years old.

582
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,520
I'm 73 years old.

583
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Are you 73 years old?

584
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
You're young.

585
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,520
You can't wear orange.

586
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,520
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Let's have a toast.

588
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
No, no.

589
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Let's have a toast.

590
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Let's have a toast.

591
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I'm sorry.

592
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I'm so happy.

593
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,520
I'm glad to see you.

594
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm glad to see you.

595
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Let's eat.

596
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Let's go.

597
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Let's go.

598
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Where are you going?

599
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,520
You can live freely.

600
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Good night.

601
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
I'm home.

602
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Welcome home.

603
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
You're home.

604
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
I'm home.

605
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,520
I'm sorry.

606
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
What's the problem?

607
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I can't do it if I sleep at home.

608
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
That's not the problem.

609
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Don't be so hard on me.

610
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Let's drink.

611
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Cheers.

612
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I saw you running.

613
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Really?

614
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I'll try to guess.

615
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
What's the problem?

616
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,520
You were in the bathroom.

617
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
You were in the bathroom.

618
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,520
You were in the bathroom.

619
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
You were in the bathroom.

620
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,520
I thought it was bad.

621
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I thought it was bad.

622
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm not bad, but I can't show my body to anyone.

623
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
I was wearing a suit at that time.

624
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
I only saw a nice body.

625
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,520
I had to rest.

626
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm on a diet.

627
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Why?

628
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Did you see it?

629
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
I can see it without seeing it.

630
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,520
It's easy to see.

631
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:04,520
I was looking for this doctor.

632
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,520
I was surprised.

633
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I realized it wasn't a joke.

634
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Thank you.

635
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
What?

636
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Do you do a beauty in the snow?

637
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Yes.

638
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:40,520
I think it's better not to be angry or do something like a joke.

639
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:53,520
I'll cheer for you if you really want to do it.

640
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
You're cool.

641
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
What?

642
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
You're like a chiyaki.

643
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,520
You shine like you're doing your job.

644
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,520
I'm sorry to say, I feel sad when I see people who have that kind of place.

645
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,520
They're all complimenting me and scolding me.

646
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
They say I'm beautiful.

647
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,520
I'm in a hurry and I'm in a hurry.

648
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
I think so.

649
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,520
I'll be honest.

650
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:39,520
I thought so.

651
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
What's wrong?

652
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,520
What's wrong, Noriko?

653
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,520
You know,

654
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,520
I know it's true.

655
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I know it's true.

656
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,520
It's me.

657
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,520
But I'm really scared.

658
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
I think it's a big adventure.

659
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,520
I'm a little excited.

660
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
You know,

661
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I used to work as a single woman and I was in the job group.

662
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,520
We knew each other.

663
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
But

664
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,520
I think I've changed a little recently.

665
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
What?

666
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I think there was a world-class competition.

667
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,520
I think it's not the last time for a child to be in the job group.

668
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
But

669
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,520
I think recently.

670
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,520
There are a lot of women.

671
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Don't be ridiculous.

672
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Maru-chan.

673
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Recently,

674
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,520
I wonder what's wrong with the atmosphere.

675
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,520
I wonder if it's bad.

676
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,520
I wonder if it's a professional.

677
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,520
I wonder if I understand.

678
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,520
No, it's not that we're not good.

679
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I wonder if it's not a fight.

680
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,520
I think so.

681
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,520
I didn't think so.

682
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Just a little.

683
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
But

684
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,520
I'm a single woman.

685
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,520
I was fighting.

686
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,520
I was just going to fight.

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Now Noriko is over.

688
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm going to fight in a new place.

689
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
It's cool.

690
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,520
I think it's cool.

691
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Really?

692
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Really.

693
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Really?

694
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Really.

695
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,520
What's wrong with you?

696
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I'm eating cabbage like this.

697
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,520
It's meat.

698
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
It's meat to fight.

699
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
I can't stop.

700
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Let's eat meat.

701
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,520
This is the house of the classmate.

702
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Wait a minute.

703
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Hey, are you there?

704
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
I'm here.

705
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Let's go.

706
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
What?

707
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,520
This is heavy.

708
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm going to take it.

709
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Come on.

710
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Thank you.

711
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I'll take care of the kids.

712
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
I'm going.

713
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Come on.

714
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
Who are you?

715
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
I'm sorry.

716
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
I have a meeting.

717
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
I'm coming.

718
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,520
I'm sorry.

719
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,520
I'm 63 and 73.

720
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,520
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Cheers!

722
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Chiaki, I'm number 1.

723
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
I'm number 1.

724
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,520
But you're scared of being alone.

725
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,520
What?

726
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Let's do it together.

727
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
What?

728
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Let's take it out together?

729
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
I don't want to take it out.

730
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Please take it out with him.

731
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,520
What I want to write.

732
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Chiaki, I don't have it.

733
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I'm sorry.

734
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,520
I'm sorry.

735
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
I'm sorry.

736
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I'm sorry.

737
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm sorry.

738
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm sorry.

739
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
I'm sorry.

740
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Welcome.

741
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Thank you.

742
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,520
I'll show you how to live.

743
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,520
My job will come together after겠습니다.

744
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,020
Excuse me.

745
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,520
Excuse us?

746
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,020
Excuse us?

747
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Excuse us?

748
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,520
The best thing is coming.

749
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I had no problem at all.

750
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Isn't this a complete victory?

751
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
I'm glad I did.

752
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,520
I was worried about the near-release speed,

753
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,520
but I was worried that it would be difficult.

754
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
How was it?

755
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,520
I was worried about the near-release speed,

756
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,520
but I was worried that it would be difficult.

757
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I was worried about the near-release speed,

758
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
but I was worried that it would be difficult.

759
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
How was it?

760
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I don't mind if it's not a regular one.

761
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Thank you for your help.

762
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Thank you.

763
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
Yuzuru-san.

764
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Yes.

765
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Is there any time left?

766
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Yes.

767
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
How about having lunch?

768
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Let's...

769
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Yes.

770
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
I'm happy.

771
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,520
This plate is delicious.

772
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
It's wonderful.

773
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,520
How is the work of the three of you?

774
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,520
I'm using a machine.

775
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Is that so?

776
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,520
You're a man who's surprisingly useful.

777
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,520
I'm surprisingly useful.

778
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
You're so nostalgic.

779
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I'm a good-for-nothing.

780
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
I see.

781
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,520
Today, I invited you to come.

782
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Yes.

783
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Please marry me.

784
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Chief, you're not really talking about that, are you?

785
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,520
You've been there for a while.

786
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,520
I understand.

787
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I thought you were saying,

788
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,520
I understand.

789
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
I'm sorry. I was too much.

790
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
No, you're not.

791
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
I understand you because you're old.

792
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm embarrassed.

793
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
I don't understand anything.

794
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,520
I don't want to.

795
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
I see.

796
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,520
I understand you're serious about what you're saying.

797
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
Yes.

798
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Mr. Nagakura.

799
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
Yes.

800
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,520
Please be my colleague.

801
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,520
What?

802
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Would you like to join me?

803
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
No.

804
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Tonight, we'll meet in a dance.

805
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Even if it's a cold day,

806
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
even if it's a bad feeling,

807
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,520
tonight, we'll meet in a dance.

808
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,520
If you don't give up,

809
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,520
tonight, we'll meet in a dance.

810
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Even if we don't understand each other,

811
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
even if we're apart.

812
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Tonight, we'll meet in a dance.

813
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Even if we don't have anything,

814
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
even if we just lose it,

815
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,520
tonight, we'll meet in a dance.

816
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
You're saying,

817
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
please fix it even if you're a Kamakura citizen?

818
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
I've lost my wife 10 years ago.

819
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,520
We're always trying to understand each other.

820
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
I'm worried about making walls.

821
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,520
I'm always by your side.

822
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
What?

823
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,520
What?

824
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
I can't believe it.

825
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,520
You're not doing it later?

826
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
That's right.

827
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,520
That means it's like a father's message.

828
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
Good morning.

829
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
It's a wonderful turn.

830
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
Good morning.

831
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
I have a白 hair today.

832
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Why are you kidding me?

833
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,520
I wonder if I can do it.

834
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,520
I won't give up today for that.

835
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,520
I wonder if I can live.
