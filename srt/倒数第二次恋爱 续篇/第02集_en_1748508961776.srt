1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I think I can help you with the English and Chinese language.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm Nagakura.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Kura-chan?

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
I think it's better to find a place to hang out in the neighborhood.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Okay, Chiaki-san.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
You're kidding me.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm a little nervous for the first time.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Please.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Kura-chan

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Hayata-san.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Hayata-san, are you okay?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Um...

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Yes?

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Today is the second start of my life.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh, really?

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
What if I can't use it?

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Don't think about it.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I want you to be strict.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't want you to be kind or sweet.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm a woman, so I'm trying my best.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm not a big fan of you, so I'm trying to be nice to you.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
I'm not a big fan of you.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,500
I'm not a big fan of you, so I'm trying to be nice to you.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't like that.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Do you know what I'm saying?

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Yes, um...

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Of course, I know.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,500
I want you to be nice to me.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I want you to be nice to me.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
So, please be strict.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Please don't do that.

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Please.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I understand.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Okay, then.

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I'll go to work.

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Okay, thank you.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Um, it's okay to be comfortable.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Um, really?

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
It's okay.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Hello!

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Welcome to Lianzha.

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
The photographer is Jin Zu-Wi.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Please come in.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
The start of your life in the hospital?

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Good morning.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Good morning.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Good morning.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm Nagakura, who is going to work with you again.

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Today is the start of my second life.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I'll do my best to help you with your Kamakura.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Thank you.

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Thank you.

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Thank you.

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You're a manager.

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm not a manager.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I've been calling you manager for a long time.

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I was the manager when I was going to work here.

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I see.

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I see.

62
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You're a manager.

63
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm a manager.

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm a manager.

65
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I see.

66
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm a manager.

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm a manager.

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
What are you going to do today?

70
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
You're the manager now.

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm going to name you.

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
What?

73
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Are you sure?

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm glad to hear that.

75
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Nagakura-kun.

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
No, it's not Kun. It's San.

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm going to call him.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
It's fine.

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Just one person.

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
What do you mean?

81
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Just one person.

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Wait, what do you mean?

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Mr. Hayata.

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Yes.

93
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
By the way,

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm a manager too.

97
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Yes.

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
What do you mean?

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Thank you.

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Take care.

101
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Hello.

102
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Hello.

103
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Wait.

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Come with me.

105
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Come on.

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Okay.

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm glad to hear that.

108
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Yes.

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm so lucky.

110
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Welcome.

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
You must be home.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Welcome.

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I thought you were at the door.

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Oh, no.

116
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Be careful.

117
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Yes.

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,500
How about a seat?

119
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I don't know.

120
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
No problem.

122
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Then, Yen Ryokan.

123
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Yes.

124
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Do you often come here?

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Yes.

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Oh, I've already ordered.

127
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Not yet.

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I wonder what's good.

129
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
I recommend the egg toji.

130
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I'll definitely reward you.

131
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I'll just eat normal.

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Do you want to ride?

133
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Yes.

134
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Two eggs toji.

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I've prepared.

136
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Excuse me.

137
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
What?

138
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Didn't the patient come to the hospital?

139
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,500
We're talking now.

140
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
We're going to do a report on the emergency.

141
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,500
We'll be looking forward to the news of Asadora.

142
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
It's a clinic.

143
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
We're going to talk about the hospital's health.

144
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,500
We're going to talk about my wife's death.

145
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
What?

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
My wife's death?

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
It looks fun.

148
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Yes, it looks fun.

149
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
It's good.

150
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I think it's good.

151
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Even if I come to the clinic, I don't have to do anything.

152
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Even if I come every day,

153
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm worried that I might have something wrong with my friends.

154
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm going to contact them and ask them to come.

155
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
That's good.

156
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I've been a little worried about my health.

157
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I thought about it when I was in the hospital.

158
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I think it's good to hear about your pain seriously.

159
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
That's a job for a doctor.

160
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
It's natural.

161
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I see.

162
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I think I understand.

163
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Please go to the secret examination.

164
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Please come again with the results.

165
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Thank you.

166
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
You have to be patient to keep running.

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Yes.

168
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
When you were in the hospital,

169
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
you told me that you were still young.

170
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
You said that you were fine.

171
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
I see.

172
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I thought that I was younger than them.

173
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
It's okay.

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I was happy.

176
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Thank you.

177
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Thank you.

178
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
It's here.

179
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Thank you.

180
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Thank you.

181
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll eat it.

182
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
It's good, right?

183
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
It's good.

184
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
It's good.

185
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I found a cure for my fever.

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I noticed that my strength was breaking.

188
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm not old enough to do that.

189
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm 60 years old and my body is still moving.

190
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I was scouted.

191
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Are you a woman?

192
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm not talking about suspicious things.

193
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
I want everyone to hear about it.

194
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I want you to help me.

195
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Thank you for your hard work.

196
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Thank you.

197
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Thank you.

198
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Why are you still here?

199
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
You're here, right?

200
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
I'm not your boss.

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Please come to the meeting.

202
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
No.

203
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Why?

204
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Please.

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm sure you have a problem.

206
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm asking you to do me a big favor.

207
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
You're trying to save the person.

208
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
That's right.

209
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Thank you.

210
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Wait.

211
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
I was trying to make you do me a big favor.

215
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
You're a senior.

216
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
You're a senior.

217
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
You're a senior.

218
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm not a person who can be treated.

219
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm a person who can be treated.

220
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Don't say that.

221
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Don't say that.

222
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Are you kidding me?

223
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm not laughing.

224
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Shut up.

225
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Hurry up.

226
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Thank you.

227
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
What are you doing?

228
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
You're such a great teacher.

229
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I see.

230
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I want to go there too.

231
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I don't want to.

232
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't want you to see me.

233
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I want you to hear me.

234
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
You should be happy.

235
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I'm not happy.

236
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm a teacher.

237
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
You're a teacher.

238
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
What?

240
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
You're a little bit selfish.

241
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
You're saying that because you're the teachers.

242
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
What?

243
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I feel something.

244
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
What?

245
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,500
When I first saw my face, I was surprised.

246
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm conscious.

247
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,500
When you're old, you have to be careful.

248
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
What do you mean?

249
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm a young man.

250
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm looking at you.

251
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What?

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm conscious.

253
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
I heard it in the drama.

254
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm afraid of the eyes.

255
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Why?

256
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I was afraid that I would get angry if I saw the eyes.

257
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Really?

258
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm afraid of the blood.

259
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I think it's because I'm a child.

260
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I understand.

261
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,500
You're still young.

262
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
I said it 12 times.

263
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
12 times?

264
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm counting.

265
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I don't think it's a young man.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,500
If I go back to the beginning, I'll be a young man.

267
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I've been living a life of life.

268
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I'll be a young man again.

269
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Why?

270
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I feel like I'm a fool.

271
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm still young.

272
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm still young.

273
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm still young.

274
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I feel like I can do something about it.

275
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Wow.

276
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Yay, Iso-Pan.

277
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Mr. Kim.

278
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Let's cheers.

279
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Cheers.

280
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Cheers.

281
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Cheers.

282
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Happy birthday.

283
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
My phone's ringing.

284
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,500
After the live show.

285
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:44,500
The Five kings behind.

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm so happy.

287
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm tired!

288
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I know, so I don't have to do this every day.

289
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
You want me to do it too?

290
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
No!

291
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Really?

292
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Wait!

293
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Wait!

294
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Thank you so much!

295
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm so sorry.

296
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm so sorry.

297
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm so sorry.

298
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
It's over.

299
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm home.

300
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I'm tired.

301
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm home.

302
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Welcome home.

303
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Did you have dinner?

304
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Yeah.

305
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
What?

306
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Is this a bag?

307
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Are you using it?

308
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Sorry, I want to concentrate.

309
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Sorry.

310
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm glad.

311
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Good night.

312
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Don't push yourself too hard.

313
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Irina,

314
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
you're not old enough to do this.

315
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You're too old to do this.

316
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You're still too young to do this.

317
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I'm glad you're not old enough.

318
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Really?

319
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Yeah, for example.

320
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Sorry.

321
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
I'm concentrating.

323
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Good night.

324
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't pull the wind.

325
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Thank you.

326
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
You're too old to do this.

327
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
No.

328
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Good night.

329
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Good night.

330
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
ep.2

331
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Good morning.

332
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Good morning, Mr. Chiaki.

333
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Good morning, Chiaki.

334
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Good morning.

335
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Thank you.

336
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
The world is shining with all the great energy.

337
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Thank you.

338
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
It's a good thing.

339
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Yes, it's good.

340
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm happy to hear that.

341
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
It's a great thing.

342
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Well, I think it's a good thing.

343
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,500
If you want to come to the top, the top, the logo, and the history,

344
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
you can come here.

345
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
That's great.

346
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,500
So I don't want to fight, so I'm looking forward to it.

347
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
That's right.

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I wish you would.

349
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Don't tell me about the future.

350
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Please.

351
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Please wait a minute.

352
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I don't want to fight, but I'm always fighting because I'm looking forward to it.

353
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
That's right.

354
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
What?

355
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
You always tell me that you're coming to me.

356
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Yes, yes, yes.

357
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Isn't it strange?

358
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
What?

359
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
What is it?

360
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I want to say that I'm not fighting, but I'm not fighting because I'm looking forward to it.

361
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
That's right.

362
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm not fighting.

363
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I think it's a mission that gives the impression that you can't speak even if you think about it.

364
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
That's great.

365
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I can't say it now.

367
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Well, isn't there something good?

368
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
It's delicious.

369
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I think I'll do my best.

370
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I feel like I have to do it when I can't do it.

371
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Last night, my father said that he wanted to do it, but he didn't say it.

372
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I didn't say it.

373
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
That's right.

374
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
I'm going to say it.

375
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm not saying it.

376
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm not saying that.

377
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Yes, breakfast.

378
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Thank you.

379
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It's delicious.

380
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
What is it?

381
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:46,500
I think I made a speech about the age of age that I can't do it, but I'm not going to do it.

382
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Wait a minute.

383
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I've heard about Elina.

384
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I've heard about it.

385
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I used that story last night.

386
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Last night.

387
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
You talked about it now.

388
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Which one did you talk about?

389
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I said it.

390
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
What are you talking about?

391
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
It's like a self-cultivation.

392
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
It's better not to change it like that.

393
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
You're going to be an old man.

394
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
You're already old.

395
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm a little late.

396
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I'm a little old.

397
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
What are you talking about?

398
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm a cute old woman.

399
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
I can't be a man.

400
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
You're so noisy.

401
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
You're so noisy.

402
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm a little old.

403
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
I'm a little old.

404
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I'm a little old.

405
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I'm a little old.

406
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Can you tell me a long story about Chiaki's logo?

407
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
My logo.

408
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Please.

409
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
I have a dream.

410
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Chiaki's logo.

411
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
For example, if I need a meeting,

412
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I will have a meeting with him.

413
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
That's my dream.

414
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
For that, I think God has made me

415
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
born in this world more than Chiaki.

416
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm a little scared.

417
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
If you feel that way,

418
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm really weird.

420
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Thank you, Mariko.

421
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Nice to meet you.

422
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Thank you.

423
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
What's this?

424
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
This is a play.

425
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I don't know if you want to play,

426
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
but I'm a little old.

427
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I'm a little old.

428
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
What about me?

429
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Are you okay?

430
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Say something.

431
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I want to be a good brother to you.

433
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I wish you well.

434
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Thank you.

435
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I hope you'll be like that.

436
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Something strange came in.

438
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Good morning.

439
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
What's wrong, Norine?

440
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Do you look like a color?

441
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I knew it.

442
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
What are you talking about?

443
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I don't want to hear it.

444
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I don't want to hear it.

445
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I got it.

446
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
It's too late.

447
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I see.

448
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
What's going on?

449
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I was watching the outside of the window yesterday.

450
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I thought I was bored.

451
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I was watching the outside of the window.

452
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I thought I'd die if I fell.

453
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Norine.

454
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm not serious.

455
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,500
I thought I'd die if I fell.

456
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
I thought I'd die if I didn't have fun.

457
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
What's that?

458
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I dropped my phone.

459
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I thought I was going to the chicken.

460
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
I fell on the tree.

461
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
I was happy.

462
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I was lucky.

463
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I fell down.

464
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
I thought I didn't eat.

465
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I went to the convenience store.

466
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I thought I'd be in trouble if I buy it.

467
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I thought I'd be in trouble if I buy it.

468
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
I went to the convenience store.

469
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
You're a local Yankee.

470
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I wonder how much trouble you have.

471
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Wait.

472
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm not sure.

473
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
I'm not sure.

474
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
I was too sad.

476
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I was confused.

477
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I was like,

478
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
What's that?

479
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I wonder where this story is.

480
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
And?

481
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
It was colored.

482
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Where?

483
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Scouts.

484
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Well,

485
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
actress?

486
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
You're not talking about the suspicious thing.

487
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Who's a scout?

488
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,500
It's like a graveyard in the city of Shukkan.

489
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It's a human hot spring.

490
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
It's a beautiful bamboo tree.

491
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Like this?

492
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
It's a human hot spring.

493
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Is it?

494
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
I know.

495
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I read it.

496
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
No, I've read it.

497
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I've done it in Kamakura.

498
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
I was in the tourist office.

499
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
I was told that.

500
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
It's a normal magazine.

501
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
You're not a regular.

502
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
That's not it.

503
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
It's a normal female magazine.

504
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
It's a famous magazine.

505
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,500
It's not a magazine that's open to people.

506
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
That's good.

507
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
It's a magazine.

508
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Who do you think you are?

509
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm going to do it.

510
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Did you decide?

511
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
I was told.

512
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I'm sorry.

513
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I was told.

514
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,500
I thought I had to waste this nice body.

515
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
So I'm going to do it.

516
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
I'm a fool.

517
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,500
I know I'm a good old man.

518
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I don't want to end it like this.

519
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,500
That's why I'm doing it.

520
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,500
My second life is sexy.

521
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I really know that I'm sexy.

522
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Um, Chikoku?

523
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Yes.

524
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Obviously.

525
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
You're eating it.

526
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Noriko.

527
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Yes.

528
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
I haven't replied yet.

529
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Your name.

530
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,500
I think there's a debate about what Noriko will do.

531
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
But I'll look into this name.

532
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Is it suspicious?

533
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Until then, don't reply.

534
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,500
And don't tell anyone who's going to send you a reply.

535
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Got it?

536
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Yes.

537
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Chikoku, thank you for your help.

538
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Thank you.

539
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Bye.

540
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Bye.

541
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Bye.

542
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Noriko.

543
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Are you okay?

544
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Yes.

545
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm going.

546
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Okay.

547
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm going.

548
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm going.

549
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
I'm going.

550
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Bye.

551
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Let's eat.

552
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Okay.

553
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm sorry about Noriko.

554
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
No, it's okay.

555
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
There are many things.

556
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,500
But I know that I'm worried about her.

557
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Well...

558
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I was a little bit worried about Noriko.

559
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I think I lost.

560
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
She's starting a second life.

561
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,500
I feel a little sad.

562
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
I see.

563
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Chiyaki, who's that?

564
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Chiyaki, the sub title of the movie, The Seven Seasons Seven.

565
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Yes.

566
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
I can see it from a little bit closer.

567
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
It's there.

568
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I've got a plan.

569
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Let's go forward.

570
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
The two-way television.

571
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
A power test?

572
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,500
The Seven Seasons Seven.

573
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Oh, that's right.

574
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Here it comes.

575
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
It's here.

576
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
The Seven Seasons Seven.

577
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
The Seven Seasons Seven.

578
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Why is it only my full name?

579
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm sorry.

580
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I don't know why.

581
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
I'm just a little bit worried.

582
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I noticed it.

583
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
I'm not going to let you know.

584
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Are you okay?

585
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Are you going to do it again?

587
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
How are you feeling recently?

588
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Yes.

589
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
She hasn't reported at all.

590
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
So, what about the test?

591
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Of course, I'm going to do it.

592
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I'm okay.

593
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Really?

594
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Yes.

595
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
The next test is coming up soon.

596
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
But so far,

597
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
there's nothing wrong.

598
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I'm glad.

599
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm relieved.

600
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
But...

601
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
But?

602
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
What?

603
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Well...

604
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm still not used to it.

605
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
What?

606
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
I'm sick.

607
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,500
I sometimes forget.

608
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
But I'm fine.

609
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
You're a good boy.

610
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,500
But I don't forget anything.

611
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
I don't have to forget that moment.

612
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I get married every day.

613
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Every day.

614
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Every day.

615
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm happy.

616
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm happy.

617
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Every day.

618
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
When I hear that,

619
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I'm worried about

620
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
losing you.

621
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
I'm kind of...

622
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm sorry.

623
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
No.

624
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I see.

625
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
You're right.

626
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,500
I'm getting married on a clear note.

627
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I understand that feeling.

628
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,500
I can't tell you what I'm good at,

629
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,500
but when I was at home,

630
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
I thought the same thing.

631
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Of course, he's not worried.

632
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I think he's scared of losing you.

633
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,500
But even in that situation,

634
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
I can say that I'm happy every day.

635
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I can say that I'm happier than yesterday and tomorrow.

636
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,500
I think that

637
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,500
life in Shimpei is wonderful.

638
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,500
It's all thanks to Tomomi.

639
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Of course, I'm grateful to you.

640
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I'm grateful to you.

641
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Thank you.

642
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm sorry.

643
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
It's okay.

644
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
It's okay.

645
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
It's okay.

646
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Ouch.

647
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Wait.

648
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
I'm sorry.

649
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
It'll be late.

650
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Let's go.

651
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Ouch.

652
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Wait.

653
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Ouch.

654
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm going to bed early.

655
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I'm going to bed early.

656
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Chiaki, are you going to bed?

657
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Yes.

658
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,500
I'm angry.

659
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm angry.

660
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm angry.

661
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I'm angry.

662
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I'm angry if I'm angry.

663
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Sorry, everyone.

664
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I'm sorry for stopping you from going to the busy place.

665
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I want you to listen to me.

666
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I want you to help me.

667
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm going to try to release the next plan for YOSHI's Chiyaki.

668
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I've decided.

669
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm going to make the best masterpiece before the end of the year.

670
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,500
So I want to ask everyone for your cooperation.

671
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Chiyaki, can I ask you something?

672
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Of course.

673
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
I'm happy.

674
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I'm happy for the best.

675
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I'm glad to hear that.

676
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:24,500
When I saw the poster of the project,

677
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I was angry.

678
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
You were angry, weren't you?

679
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Yes.

680
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
What kind of anger is that?

681
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,500
It's like someone's scratch.

682
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Do you have it?

683
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Yes.

684
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Thank you.

685
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Look.

686
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
It says,

687
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
It says,

688
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Look.

689
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Look.

690
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
My drama is not in it.

691
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Yes.

692
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
That's it.

693
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
That's it, Sakuma.

694
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
It's not possible.

695
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
It's a reality.

696
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,500
But I feel sad and frustrated.

697
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,500
So I'm going to do it without any regrets.

698
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I'm told that anger is a big energy for all the projects.

699
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
I'm angry for society.

700
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
I'm angry for myself.

701
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm angry for someone who can't forgive me.

702
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I think it's okay.

703
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I'm happy for Chiyaki.

704
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Chiyaki has been angry recently.

705
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
I feel a little sad.

706
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Why are you laughing?

707
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
I'm angry for Chiyaki.

708
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm always angry.

709
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Why?

710
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I'm always angry for the starting point.

711
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I'm going to do it.

712
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Don't be angry.

713
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Really?

714
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
But,

715
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm angry for Chiyaki.

716
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm going to show you my power.

717
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Yes.

718
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
It's good.

719
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
It's good.

720
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I'm excited.

721
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm going to make a masterpiece.

722
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
It's a little late.

723
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
It's not late.

724
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
It's a lot late.

725
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
It's a lot late.

726
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
But,

727
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
it's still here.

728
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
It's still here.

729
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
I want to enjoy the beginning.

730
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Yes.

731
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
If you don't enjoy it,

732
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
let's change anger into joy.

733
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
As expected, Mr. Mitsui.

734
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
It's a long story.

735
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I like it.

736
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,500
I've never had a lot of power or thought.

737
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,500
I hope you can listen to everyone's story.

738
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,500
At that time, everyone is a main character.

739
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
I want you to listen to your life.

740
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
I'm thinking about what to say.

741
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I like what I like.

742
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,500
I hope you can listen to your life.

743
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Thank you.

744
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
First,

745
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Sakuma, how do you feel?

746
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I'm fine.

747
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
I'm not good.

748
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
I'm going to be hot.

749
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
I don't know if it's interesting.

750
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,500
It's okay if it's boring.

751
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
It's interesting.

752
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
I want you to be happy.

753
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
I like dramas like that.

754
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
I want to make a drama like that.

755
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
I understand.

756
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
You don't look like a man.

757
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,500
There was a time when I was a child.

758
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I wanted to have a sparta lesson like crying in 5 seconds.

759
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I wanted to have a heart attack.

760
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I was a father, a grandmother, and a grandmother.

761
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I was a murderer in my head.

762
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm going to be successful if Iasi a child I like.

763
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:52,500
I have an intention to do it.

764
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500

3 times through here

770
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I would like to recommend this wonderful place to the people of Japan.

771
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
I look forward to your continued support.

772
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
I will leave this here.

773
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Thank you for your support.

774
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Thank you very much.

775
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Excuse me.

776
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
What?

777
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Hello.

778
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Thank you for your hard work.

779
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
I have something to talk to you about.

780
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Do you mind if I eat?

781
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
You don't refuse, do you?

782
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,700
Of course.

783
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Thank you. I will contact you.

784
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Please come out.

785
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Thank you for your hard work.

786
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
What are you talking about?

787
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
Thank you for your hard work.

788
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Thank you for your hard work.

789
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Thank you.

790
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Thank you.

791
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Cheers.

792
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,700
What's wrong?

793
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
I'm sorry.

794
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
I want to talk to you about something.

795
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
I would like to invite you.

796
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
I will send you a message.

797
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,700
I will send you a message.

798
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I will send you a message.

799
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,700
I don't want to.

800
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
I have something to talk to you about.

801
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
I will send you a message.

802
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Of course.

803
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I have started to move.

804
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I will do it.

805
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,700
I will do it.

806
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
I have started to move.

807
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,700
I found a temporary home nearby.

808
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
A temporary home?

809
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Yes.

810
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,700
I will go to the hospital.

811
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
I will tell him that I am still young.

812
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
I will tell him that I am still young.

813
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
I will tell him that I am still young.

814
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,700
I feel like I am being praised.

815
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,700
I think my original instinct is anger.

816
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
I think everyone knows that.

817
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Really?

818
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,700
But I don't feel good just because of anger.

819
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,700
I feel that anger is the power to control myself.

820
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
I feel that anger is the power to control myself.

821
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
I feel that anger is the power to control myself.

822
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,700
When I was in a hurry, I noticed that I was in a good harmony.

823
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
I noticed that I was in a good harmony.

824
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
You are a very good person.

825
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Yes.

826
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
So I will challenge myself.

827
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
I will challenge myself.

828
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
I will enter the team.

829
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
I have already declared to the team.

830
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Oh.

831
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
I want to make a hit song.

832
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
I want to make a big masterpiece.

833
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
I see.

834
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Can I make a hit song?

835
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,700
Can you make a hit song?

836
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Yes.

837
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,700
I think my original instinct is anger.

838
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,700
I think my original instinct is anger.

839
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
What is it?

840
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
It is a trouble.

841
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:46,700
I think I will be pushed to the limit and I will be pushed to the limit.

842
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I think it is a trouble.

843
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I see.

844
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,700
I think it is difficult to say.

845
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,700
But it may be like that.

846
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,700
I see.

847
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,700
What was pushed?

848
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Well, when I talk about the current situation,

849
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:12,700
I have one thought that it was a trouble.

850
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I think it will be a trouble.

851
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,700
I think it is a problem.

852
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I think it is a problem.

853
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
I think it is a problem.

854
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
I think it is a problem.

855
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Do you know Japanese medicine?

856
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
I know it.

857
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,700
You have been taken as a responsibility in the world medicine problem.

858
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
I remember that.

859
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:43,700
The country has recognized Japanese medicine for about 100 countries.

860
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Kamakura has recognized it for about 10 years.

861
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Kamakura seems to be doing a lot.

862
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Yes.

863
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:57,700
But Kamakura is not good at appealing strongly.

864
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Even if you don't appeal, you can come to the customer.

865
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,700
It is a basic front-of-the-world.

866
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
Kamakura is a popular front-of-the-world.

867
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,700
I don't think it is a problem.

868
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Japanese medicine is not appealing strongly.

869
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,700
You can take it as a responsibility.

870
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Are you okay?

871
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
No, I am fine.

872
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,700
It is also a responsibility to take what I have been recognized.

873
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:36,700
It is a situation that I should not appeal.

874
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
What is the problem?

875
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,700
The problem is that I am the one who is involved in the development of the tourist attraction.

876
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Isn't it a lot of trouble?

877
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,700
It is a lot of trouble.

878
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:59,700
It is not fun to say that I am happy.

879
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,700
It is just that I feel that my level is growing.

880
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,700
What is this?

881
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,700
Isn't it a life like that?

882
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,700
I don't want to admit it.

883
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
If you say so.

884
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,700
What is the second point of the warning?

885
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I met the mayor of Gusea today.

886
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,700
I was invited to dinner because I had a story.

887
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
I wondered what this was.

888
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Isn't it that?

889
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
I asked for a body.

890
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
What is it?

891
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,700
I have a feeling that this is a total warning.

892
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,700
I think this is going to be a trouble.

893
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I have been invited by the staff of the tourist association.

894
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
You are a security guard.

895
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
Why do you know?

896
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,700
I ran to the place where I was not blind.

897
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,700
I said I was a security guard.

898
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
What does this mean?

899
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,700
It's been a long time since I came to the airport.

900
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,700
It's okay if you don't come.

901
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,700
But it was good that we were able to move.

902
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,700
I think it would be good if we could get better.

903
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,700
It was good to be in trouble.

904
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,700
Let's make a T-shirt.

905
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,700
A T-shirt?

906
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Please let me be in trouble.

907
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Please don't.

908
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Who are you?

909
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,700
I'm a person who is in trouble because I'm about to be in trouble.

910
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Let's make that.

911
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
Please let me be in trouble.

912
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Please make me a T-shirt.

913
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
Let's make that.

914
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,700
It's like a love case.

915
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,700
The picture is big.

916
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,700
I'm nervous.

917
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
Please stop.

918
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,700
The title is different.

919
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,700
It's a high-level case.

920
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
It's a high-level case.

921
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,700
It's a high-level case.

922
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,700
It's a boy who likes Ero-hon.

923
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,700
I like Ero-hon.

924
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,700
It's a high-level case.

925
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,700
I haven't heard that story yet.

926
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,700
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,700
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,700
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,700
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,700
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,700
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,700
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,700
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Tonight,

941
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,700
it's so boring to dance.

942
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,700
Even if I don't hold anything,

943
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,700
even if I'm simply sad,

944
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
today,

945
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,200
it's so boring to dance.

946
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,700
I won't give up.

947
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,700
It's a catchball.

948
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,700
It's a catchball.

949
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,700
Catching the role of mine in my life.

950
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,700
It's boring.

951
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Don't do things like that.

952
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,700
Don't worry.

953
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,700
I can do it.

954
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,700
I don't have anything I want to do with Mariko.

955
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,700
Yusho, how about a lunch?

956
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,700
I'm happy.

957
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,700
I'm sure you'll be able to talk to me in a manly manner.

958
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,700
I'll give you this.

959
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
Let's do it in a different way.

960
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Come on!

961
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,700
I'll give you a hug.

962
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:06,700
I don't think I can live without you anymore.
