Episode 2

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
No way!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ouch!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ouch!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yoshino-san!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yoshino-san!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yoshino-san!

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm coming in!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Wait a minute!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yoshino-san?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yoshino-san, are you okay?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yoshino-san, are you okay?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Was it a bad day?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Good morning!

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Good morning!

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How do you feel?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I think it's good.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Really?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm useful.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm happy.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're always useless?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I see.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Look.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wow!

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I found a treasure.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why did you sleep in the bed?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have a cat.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What is this?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's like a thief entered the room.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wow!

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Good morning.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Good morning.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're early.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I fell asleep.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I couldn't sleep.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have a sore throat.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A sore throat?

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, no, no.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have a sore throat.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A sore throat.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Good morning.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Good morning.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Didn't you go to your friend's house?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I did, but I went home alone.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go home.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I wanted to go outside.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wouldn't you like to love sleep?

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What isn't it?

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Suriad?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sur semicircle scale?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:53,460
That's a weird feature of my

59
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,460
friends.

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,000
You were before Hanyu â€“

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I heard that you were drunk last night.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did you go there alone again?

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't go there.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I heard a strange sound.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I thought you wouldn't be drunk.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I heard that you were going to stay at the hot spring with Nori-nee.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's right.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Good morning.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Good morning.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are at the hot spring with Nori-nee.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have to explain from there.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I came back yesterday.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sure it's more interesting to see Noriko.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Good morning.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are you doing?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How is it?

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Chie, don't you drink too much?

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I suddenly became a girl.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I heard a strange sound.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I drank too much.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you okay?

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is it okay to sleep?

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What?

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The wind is popular.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is the wind popular now?

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is it popular?

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is the wind popular?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's not popular.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not the time to sleep.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why do you know that I drank and came back?

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Because my brother said so.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He said so.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I drank and came back.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good morning.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Please have breakfast.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Nori-nee has already come back.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Listen.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Chie came back on her own.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It was hard.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She will come back.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I came to the hot spring.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I saw a good woman behind me.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who do you think that woman is?

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's an old man.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's not just an old man.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's my husband.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Really?

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I see.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was similar to the past.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was similar.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How did it happen?

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was hard.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I was surprised.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You know.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We talked a lot.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I thought there were some bad things.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I put a perm on my hair.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I look like a man.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It was like a snowfall.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was drunk and woke up in the morning.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was not there.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I ran away again.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You were at the hot spring.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was working at the hot spring.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I was a woman.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It was not a big deal.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I came and I found out a lot of lies.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't be there anymore.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why did you lie?

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm a man of the law.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I just got out of prison.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please let me work.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't need money.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I want to protect my wife.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who is that?

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a woman from Takakura.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm glad you're alive.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm glad you're alive.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Chiaki wants to ask you for a job again.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Really?

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was smiling and it was beautiful.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm glad.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was really beautiful.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm glad.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have a question for Chiaki.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What is it?

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Since you came here, you have been looking down.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is it because of the girl's meeting last night?

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then what is it?

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm worried about that.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I've never seen Chiaki's expression.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What happened?

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm afraid you'll find out.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm afraid.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm glad you're happy.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This morning, my mother called me.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
She said, come back.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't mean to stop working.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I just wanted to see her.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
My father is sick.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He has liver disease.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I want to see him.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He said it like a rumor.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What does that mean?

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm worried about Chiaki's daughter.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was worried about her.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I took a lot of pictures.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I took a picture here.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was told that the fire was on the other side.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I was told that the fire was on the other side.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But it's a lie.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a lie?

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a lie that my father is sick.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's not a lie.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My mother has a good family.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Maybe it's a case of Katsudon.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is it?

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
When Chiaki was in his 30s, his mother contacted Chiaki's father.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She wanted to meet Chiaki's father.

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
She wanted to meet Chiaki's father.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When she went back to Nagano with him,

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Chiaki's father was hiding in a restaurant.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My mother is fine with that kind of lie.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's what happened this morning.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But you're going home, right?

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I told you it was a lie.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been deceived many times.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's okay to lie.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Please be deceived many times.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
My father wants to see me.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No, no, no.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I think everyone in the Nagano family thinks the same.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We are children who lost their parents early.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I can't see you even if I want to see you.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you say anything more, everyone will be angry.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What is it?

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Chiaki's expression seemed to be anxious.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was worried about what to do if I was sick.

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's why I've been in a daze since morning.

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was in a daze.

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What should I do?

210
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Can I become an enemy of the Nagakura family?

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What is it?

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Chiaki.

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Chiaki.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Chiaki.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Chiaki.

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why are you all looking at me like that?

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I understand.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going home now.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm going home now.

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Be careful.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You don't have to think about souvenirs.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why are you eating?

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going with you.

224
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why me?

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm told that there is no man.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I made a promise to the person next to me.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I want to see that man.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I want to take him home.

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't say that.

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm going to get ready.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm going to get ready.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank you.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You are good.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wait.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hurry up.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going to wear a jacket.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm going to get ready.

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to get ready.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to get ready.

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to get ready.

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to get ready.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm going to get ready.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm going to get ready.

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to get ready.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to get ready.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to get ready.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm going to get ready.

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to get ready.

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm going to get ready.

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to get ready.

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sleeping on the bed.

252
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a battle between me and my mother.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I will be the only one who survives.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is it like a marriage?

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Darling.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Honey.

257
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Did you contact your mother when you were going home?

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I suddenly went home.

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I suddenly attacked where I was going.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Really?

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a battle between me and my mother.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You often see this in dramas.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The lover lies and returns to the family.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I understand if you are in your 30s.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you have to do this?

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm worried about my daughter.

267
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm worried that she won't die.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know how many times I can see my parents.

269
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I have to make her feel safe.

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I was planning to ask my daughter.

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Will you do well?

272
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's make it work.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Please wait.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There is a car park.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A car park?

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's a good place.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll go there.

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is it Kiyoshi?

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's Chiaki.

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Good morning.

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's wrong?

282
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Did you meet my father recently?

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I met him yesterday.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Did you meet him yesterday?

285
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was eating katsudon at a restaurant in front of the station.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
My father likes katsudon.

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Thank you.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll contact you again.

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Goodbye.

291
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's why.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's a katsudon incident again.

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm glad you're fine.

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I agree.

295
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're used to it.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's make a safe and safe operation.

297
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Thank you.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What should we do with the setting?

299
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's like a couple dating.

300
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's like a real marriage.

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's go to the right side.

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's go to the right side.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This is the elementary school I went to.

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Really?

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Excuse me.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hello.

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm a graduate of this school.

308
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Can I see the inside?

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Please.

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Thank you.

311
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm a graduate of this school.

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hello.

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're cute.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're a junior.

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You were here when you were in elementary school.

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was really cute.

318
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You say that yourself.

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes, I do.

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think I had the most fun back then.

321
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Really?

322
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

323
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I was really cute and I learned a lot.

324
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You say that yourself.

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I always play with boys.

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm a little naughty.

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was playing with the girls on the phone.

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I said I was a junior.

329
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was playing with them until I was tired.

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We were all together until middle school.

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We broke up in high school.

332
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
High school, college, and job hunting.

333
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The older you get, the more you get.

334
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You're a group of people with the same experience.

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I thought it was boring.

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe.

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
At the drama set,

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
a lot of people from different backgrounds gather.

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They make a work.

340
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Cameraman, lighting, voice,

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
the car department, production department, hair and makeup, stylist.

342
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
A lot of people gather.

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There are even little children.

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
From there, to the police station.

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Everyone gathers and gives each other strength.

346
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's fun.

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
At the drama set, you can go back to a naughty Yoshino.

348
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I see.

349
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's definitely more fun to have a lot of things.

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's diversity now.

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It really is.

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What is it?

353
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think I know a little about Yoshino Chiyaki.

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh my.

355
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What is that?

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't you understand?

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When I come back, it's sad.

358
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was born and raised here.

359
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
When I look at it like this,

360
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I wonder how everyone lives here.

361
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a little urban.

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's a little from above.

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't like that.

364
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I think it's not my place anymore.

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a little bad.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm a little nervous.

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Katoi is Tokyo.

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm in Kamakura now.

369
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm in Kanagawa Prefecture.

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't feel like I'm home because I don't have a home.

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
When I come back to the countryside, I think about it and it's sad.

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm going to be a Yoshino soon.

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're a great otaku.

374
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's a typical countryside house.

375
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll beat you.

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Please.

377
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
My partner.

378
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Ryuka.

379
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Darling.

380
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Honey?

381
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why are you laughing with a big voice?

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm back.

383
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm Chiyaki.

384
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Are you okay?

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What should I do?

386
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Please sleep.

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What are you doing?

389
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What are you doing in the kitchen?

390
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What should I do?

393
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why did you plan to go home and arrive at the station?

394
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It was a lie.

395
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This child is not cute.

396
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You're a kind person who pretends to be deceived.

397
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No.

398
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm Yuriko.

399
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm Chiyaki's mother.

400
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He's my husband.

401
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm Takashi.

402
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm Nagakura Wahe.

403
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

404
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
No.

405
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is Kamakura Meibitsu.

407
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I heard that you have many friends.

408
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Thank you.

409
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
How many are you?

410
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
34.

411
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Nagakura is a genius.

412
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A genius?

413
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He is a friend of a woman of the same generation.

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He has 34 members.

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He died last month alone.

416
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He has 34 now.

417
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's great.

418
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm not saying it was a good thing, but it was good.

419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't think I'll ever get it because I'm not in it.

420
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll take it.

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I wish I had more.

422
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You said you wanted to meet such a cheerful person.

424
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Did I say that?

425
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You two were cheerful.

426
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Thank you.

427
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm not going to die.

428
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm not going to die.

429
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Is that the feeling of your brother's marriage?

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's not like that.

431
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Then what?

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You know Rokusuke.

433
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I love him.

434
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I know.

435
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He's the one who wrote the song.

436
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I love him.

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I went to the park on the street.

438
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I got an autograph.

439
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I read it in A's book.

440
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There was a story about an old man saving money with his friends.

441
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm practicing it.

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You save money together and go on a trip?

443
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No.

444
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't use it.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What does that mean?

446
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Please explain.

447
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
At first, there were 40 people.

448
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
38 people.

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Each year, 38 people save 10,000 yen for the exchange of common currency.

450
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They save 10,000 yen each year without using it.

451
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What's fun about that?

452
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In the last 30 years, there were 380,000 yen.

453
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
In the 20th year, there were 760,000 yen.

454
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
As I said earlier, there are 34 people who are dying little by little.

455
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's getting smaller.

456
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What do you do with the saved money?

457
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Finally, it becomes one person who is left alive.

458
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
In the last 30 years, there were 10 million people.

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I can't die.

460
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I don't want to die.

461
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't want to live or do something like this.

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't want to die.

463
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This is important.

464
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Last month, I saw everyone at the funeral.

465
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I was alone.

466
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't say that.

467
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This is important.

468
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
When you get older, you feel lonely that he died.

469
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We are different.

470
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm alone.

471
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
How many people are left?

472
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Rokusuke is wonderful.

473
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He is the best.

474
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What were you talking about?

475
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I know that you are too energetic.

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I know that you won't die for a long time.

477
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Let's go home.

478
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What are you talking about?

479
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I won't go home.

480
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Ohayu.

481
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes.

482
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm sorry to wake you up.

483
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No, it's okay.

484
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's a small town.

485
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's daytime.

486
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I sleep at night.

487
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I see.

488
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I can sleep for 90 minutes.

489
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The number of people has increased.

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's a small town.

491
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Is it a gag?

492
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Here.

493
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Romance.

494
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
This is my daughter's fiancee.

495
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Wait.

496
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's not me.

497
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Please.

498
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Dad.

499
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Are you doing well with your brother?

500
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yes.

501
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
No problem.

502
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Really?

503
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You think so?

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm talking to you.

505
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Don't pretend to be a mother and daughter.

506
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Your mother is a real mother.

507
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Let's be a good daughter-in-law.

508
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
My daughter is only one.

509
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Why?

510
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Because...

511
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You're a little noisy.

512
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You're noisy.

513
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You two are similar.

514
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Is that person a good person?

515
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Is that person a popular person?

516
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes.

517
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But...

518
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You're not a good person.

519
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Really?

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Your favorite man is delicate.

521
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You're a little noisy.

522
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That's not all.

523
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I think it will go well.

524
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm not like your father.

525
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I think so.

526
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I see.

527
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But...

528
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm glad you're fine.

529
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I thought it was a lie, but I was a little worried.

530
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I see.

531
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's right.

532
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I forgot about the savings.

533
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You won't die.

534
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But...

535
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I don't want to forget it until the end.

536
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's right.

537
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I was most worried.

538
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Father.

539
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'll have another drink.

540
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Then I'll have three drinks.

541
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Three drinks?

542
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's a snack gag.

543
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You're getting weak.

544
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's right.

545
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Mr. Nagakurasu.

546
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yes.

547
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Please take care of Chiaki.

548
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He's like a treasure.

549
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He's our child.

550
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Stop it.

551
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I understand.

552
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Thank you.

553
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm happy to be with you.

554
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm happy.

555
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm glad.

556
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I have confidence.

557
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I have confidence that I have raised a good person.

558
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But...

559
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I have one regret.

560
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I regret it.

561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I remember that I had a hard time.

562
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What?

563
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
When I was in the first grade, I was careless.

564
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I was 100% careless.

565
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I burned my child.

566
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I was late when I thought about it.

567
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I got burned here.

568
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I know that this child is not crying.

569
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I know that I'm worried about him.

570
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I know that he's not crying.

571
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I still remember that child.

572
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm so happy.

573
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm shaking.

574
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm crying.

575
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I want to cry.

576
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't know what's going on.

577
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm scared.

578
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I can't hear.

579
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't have a child.

580
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Really?

581
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes.

582
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I was in the first grade.

583
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm over 50 years old.

584
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't have a child.

585
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Really?

586
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm glad.

587
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Time has passed.

588
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm glad.

589
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What?

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Why do you know that I don't have a child?

591
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Did you see it?

592
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I thought it was strange.

593
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I thought I was sleeping.

594
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I saw it.

595
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm a bad person.

596
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What is a bad person?

597
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Don't look at me like that.

598
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I saw it.

599
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I saw it because you called me.

600
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I didn't call you.

601
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I rang the bell.

602
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I was sleeping.

603
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You didn't call me.

604
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm a pervert.

605
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You're a pervert.

606
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You're a pervert.

607
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm not a pervert.

608
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I admit that I saw it.

609
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I was seen.

610
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm a bad person.

611
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What is a bad person?

612
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I was a bad person.

613
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Which one is bad?

614
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm glad.

615
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm a bad person.

616
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm glad.

617
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I saw it.

618
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's natural.

619
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You can't turn it upside down.

620
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What are you sorry for?

622
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I understand.

623
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's a lie.

624
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I was in a relationship with an adult.

625
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I see.

626
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's not a lie.

627
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's not a lie.

628
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's not a lie.

629
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You said you liked me.

630
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's not a lie.

631
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's not a lie.

632
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's not a lie.

633
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You said it.

634
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You said it.

635
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You said it.

636
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Why are you laughing?

637
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You were watching the play.

638
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't know.

639
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Please understand.

640
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's not over.

641
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It was a beautiful butt.

642
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I didn't say it was a beautiful butt.

643
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's not a beautiful butt.

644
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's not a beautiful butt.

645
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You're not a child.

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Stop it.

647
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'll be a child when I come back.

648
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm a child.

649
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You're a child.

650
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You're a child.

651
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll tell you the truth.

652
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'll tell you the truth.

653
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Your weapon.

654
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'll tell you the truth.

655
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Oh, my God.

656
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm sorry.

657
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
She looks fine.

658
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
She's my daughter.

659
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
No?

660
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
She looks so happy.

661
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Is there any living thing?

662
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think so.

663
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Do you see people fishing over there?

664
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The water is so beautiful.

665
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You can see it.

666
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
What was it called?

667
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
They throw stones.

668
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's a water cut.

669
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Did you do a water cut?

670
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
No.

671
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I did it.

672
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's not like you did it.

673
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I think it was in middle school.

674
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
When a man won a water cut,

675
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
he said he would marry Yoshino.

676
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It was a big thing.

677
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I was like,

678
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I can't stop being childish.

679
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I was so nervous.

680
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I wanted to ask him to marry me.

681
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You must be so happy.

682
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What was the result?

683
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The girl I liked the most won.

684
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
14 times.

685
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
14 times?

686
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Did you date her?

687
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
No.

688
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
She married a cute girl from Tokyo.

689
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
She's still living happily.

690
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I was popular at that time.

691
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I guess so.

692
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's the peak of life.

693
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Peak?

694
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes.

695
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
14 times?

696
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The number of times you get the right to marry Yoshino.

697
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yes.

698
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
He was 14 times.

699
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So 14 times is more than 5 times.

700
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
More than 5 times.

701
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Let's see how many times he gets.

702
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
What?

703
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
No, I'm not confident.

704
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Really?

705
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm not a pitcher.

706
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Let's see.

707
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Is it important to choose the stone?

708
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes.

709
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I heard it's good to choose the stone.

710
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Let's go this way.

711
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
This way.

712
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's go.

713
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'll take a closer look.

714
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Let's go.

715
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

716
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Thank you for your hard work.

717
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Thank you for the noodles.

718
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Thank you for the noodles.

719
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Thank you very much.

720
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Be careful.

721
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Thank you.

722
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I was busy.

723
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Let's close today.

724
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes.

725
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank you.

726
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I knew this would happen.

727
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Thank you for your hard work.

728
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll help you clean up.

729
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Thank you.

730
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What are they doing?

731
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't know.

732
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What's going on with them?

733
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't know.

734
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't think they've changed in 10 years.

735
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I think so too.

736
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think so too.

737
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't think they've changed.

738
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If they've been together for too long, they can't get back together.

739
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's common in dramas.

740
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
They say it's a long spring.

741
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's the same for both.

742
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You and Chiaki.

743
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You should give up and get back together.

744
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I don't want to comment on it.

745
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But in dramas, they can't get back together.

746
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Thank you very much.

747
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I didn't know they'd come here.

748
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Hello.

749
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You're here.

750
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Eisou.

751
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
O-chan.

752
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I wanted to help, but it's hard to do it with them.

753
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
