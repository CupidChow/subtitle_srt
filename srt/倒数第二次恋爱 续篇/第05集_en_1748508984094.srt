1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
What it taught that you are aishop

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,000
is that we really are the residents of the village

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,700
This is a request

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,000
is the first thing our director wants to ask

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I hope everything will turn out well

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,900
As for what Mom wants

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,100
I got already

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,100
Manager circles

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,700
To give to самой

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,660
Name your own bike

11
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,900
customers

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,080
You have

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,420
You said arena, didn't you?

14
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
How do I know?

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,340
That's clocked out in the cafe, right?

16
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,460
What?

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,460
But

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,100
it's not sold

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,100
I can only see one person when I sell it.

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,100
What?

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,100
Have you ever been to my shop?

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Then why do you know that?

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Because my father told me.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
What?

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
You're the only girl in Nagakura, right?

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Yes, I'm 24 years old.

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm an artist.

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
That's amazing.

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm collecting trash from the Kamakura sea.

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Do you have a picture of it?

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
I want to see it.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
This is trash.

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
This is trash?

34
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
That's amazing.

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
My brother was running a cafe.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,100
He was selling at the cafe in Nagakura.

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,100
That's smart.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,100
If you sell it at a cafe, it will be sold out.

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
It's not sold.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,100
If you sell it, it will only be seen by the person.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
That's meaningless.

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,100
That's great.

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
You're a beautiful girl.

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Do you have a picture of it?

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
This is Elina.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Elina.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
She looks like my mother.

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Show me.

49
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,100
Show me your face.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
She's beautiful.

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
She's cute.

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,100
We live together.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
I can't leave my mother.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
I lost my mother.

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
I'm a father.

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,100
I'm close to her.

57
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Father.

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Father.

59
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
That's it.

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,100
I'm close to her.

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
It's like a computer.

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
A computer?

63
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
What's your name?

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
I don't know you.

65
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
I feel bad.

66
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Yuto.

67
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Yuto.

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
I'm Yuto.

69
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Nice to meet you.

70
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,100
The sea trash you picked up last time.

71
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
It's in the back. Come and see it.

72
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Father.

73
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Father.

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Thank you for waiting.

75
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Come in.

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm back.

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,100
Welcome back.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Father.

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
I have something to show you.

80
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
Father.

81
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
This?

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
I think it's nice.

83
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
This is for you.

84
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Really? Thank you.

85
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
What's this?

86
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
What's this?

87
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
What's this?

88
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Thank you.

89
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Again?

90
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
What do you want to do?

91
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,100
There was an incident the other day.

92
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm worried about you.

93
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm worried about you.

94
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
I'm worried about you.

95
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Good morning.

96
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
Good morning.

97
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Are you sleepy?

98
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
I'm sleepy.

99
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm sleepy.

100
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm not sleepy.

101
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm not sleepy.

102
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm not sleepy.

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
You've grown up.

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
I'm a good son.

105
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,100
I was working late last night.

106
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I heard a noise outside.

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
I couldn't sleep.

108
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm worried about you.

109
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
I'm worried about you.

110
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
I'm worried about you.

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
You're a big girl.

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm not a big girl.

113
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
That's right.

114
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Good morning.

115
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Good morning.

116
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
I'm going to sleep.

117
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Okay.

118
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Mr. Kamakura.

119
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
How long are you going to work at the station?

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
You should go to the mayor.

121
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
You're busy.

122
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
You're busy.

123
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
You're busy.

124
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
You're busy.

125
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
You're busy.

126
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
You're busy.

127
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
You're busy.

128
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
You're busy.

129
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
You're busy.

130
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
You're busy.

131
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
That's a good thing.

132
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
That's a good thing.

133
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
You didn't grow up.

134
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Do you understand this?

135
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,100
The mayor's election will be held in the next election.

136
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Mr. Nagakura will be the mayor.

137
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Mr. Chiyaki will be the mayor.

138
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
The day after tomorrow.

139
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
I'm going to sleep.

140
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Mr. Ippa.

141
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
This is what I'm going to do.

142
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm going to take off my shirt.

143
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
What?

144
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm going to take it off.

145
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm going to be the manager this time.

146
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
I'm a little worried about my debut.

147
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Thank you for your cooperation.

148
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Please leave it to me.

149
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
We were talking about something.

150
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
The story of Chiaki-san being scared at night and unable to sleep.

151
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,100
The story of the newspaper article will be linked to the story.

152
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
That's right. What is the newspaper article?

153
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,100
This is a story about a woman living alone in the old house.

154
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:32,680
The house is built in a

155
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
house.

156
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
It's a house.

It's a house.

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
It's a house.

195
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
It's a house.

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
It's a house.

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
It's a house.

198
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
It's a house.

199
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
It's a house.

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
It's a house.

201
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
It's a house.

202
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
It's a house.

203
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
It's a house.

204
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
It's a house.

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
It's a house.

206
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
It's a house.

207
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
It's a house.

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
It's a house.

209
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
It's a house.

210
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
It's a house.

211
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
It's a house.

212
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
It's a house.

213
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,680
I'll report to you again.

214
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Please.

215
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Next.

216
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Can I talk to you?

217
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Sure.

218
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
I'll go back to the topic.

219
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm worried about the old people's house.

220
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,680
There are many people living alone in Kamakura.

221
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,680
It's been a riot.

222
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
People come in.

223
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
I think the residents are scared.

224
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,680
I don't want to be a burden to Mr. Yoshino.

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Mr. Yoshino lives alone.

226
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
We are here.

227
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:25,680
If there is a problem, I can call the police.

228
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
I think it will ease the anxiety of the residents.

229
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Yes.

230
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
I bought this.

231
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,680
It's a special bell.

232
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,680
It's a bear.

233
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,680
The bear has a button.

234
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,680
If you press it, you can get a call.

235
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
What?

236
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
What?

237
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
What?

238
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
What?

239
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
What?

240
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
What?

241
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
What?

242
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
What?

243
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
What?

244
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm so surprised.

245
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
It's a special bell.

246
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
What?

247
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
What?

248
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
What?

249
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
What?

250
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
What?

251
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
What?

252
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
What?

253
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
What?

254
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,680
Escaping Escaping Escaping

255
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Wait a moment.

256
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
It's taking a while.

257
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Please do your best for the next 55 minutes.

258
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Thank you.

259
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
I'm sorry. Thank you.

260
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
It's fine.

261
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,680
But you can't drink everyday.

262
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
What do you mean?

263
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
You can't bring alcohol.

264
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
That's not a bad idea.

265
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm not a sheep.

266
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
You can't do it without any reason?

267
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I told you not to do it.

268
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
It's fine.

269
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Just come with me.

270
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Well...

271
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,680
If you insist.

272
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
I'm just a little drunk.

274
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I think it's fine.

275
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm just a little drunk.

276
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
I see.

277
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Anyway...

278
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Thank you.

279
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,680
kt

280
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,680
I have a lot to tell you.

281
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
Really?

282
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Are you okay, Mr. Yu Shun?

283
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,480
Hey, why are you leaving me behind?

284
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,880
What are you talking about?

285
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,480
This is proof that you're capable.

286
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
You should be proud of yourself.

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,480
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,280
I'm going to go home and get angry.

289
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I think I understand.

290
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,680
Hey, this is all a apology.

291
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,280
What kind of job are you doing?

292
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Nagakura, it's no exaggeration to say that you were born to apologize.

293
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,080
If you apologize, you'll become a citizen.

294
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
I'm not happy with that.

295
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,280
That's great.

296
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,480
You're a talented person.

297
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,680
What do you mean?

298
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Boss.

299
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,280
You should make the most of your talent.

300
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,880
Thank you for today.

301
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,680
Thank you.

302
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Please take a taxi.

303
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,680
Don't put the text on your doorstep.

304
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,280
You have to disconnect my text.

305
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,480
One Anderson for one person each.

306
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
Here.

307
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Are you Shia?

308
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm aiming at you.

309
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,440
A girl?

310
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,680
What did you do Toansi?

311
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Really?

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm so happy.

313
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Next year?

314
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Yes.

315
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Really?

316
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Yes.

317
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
What are you going to do?

318
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,680
I know you have a lot of work to do.

319
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,680
No, I don't have any work.

320
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
That's too bad.

321
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,680
You're so young.

322
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,680
You'll have a good job.

323
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Thank you for saying that.

324
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
How long ago did you start working?

325
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Five years ago.

326
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
But I quit a year ago.

327
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,680
I was told by the company's seminar that I was a second life.

328
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I was told that I wanted to work.

329
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
I thought I would rot if I waited a year.

330
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
So I quit and started a new job.

331
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,680
I want to find people like you who are capable of retirement.

332
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,680
I want to find people like you who are capable of retirement.

333
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
You're so cool.

334
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I'm so happy.

335
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I want to find people like you.

336
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Really?

337
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm so honored to hear that.

338
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,680
It's interesting.

339
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,680
I think we'll meet again in this age.

340
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Sorry, I'm late.

341
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Sorry.

342
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Here are the audition documents.

343
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Let's go.

344
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Wait a minute.

345
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Excuse me.

346
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
What is it?

347
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
I have a suggestion.

348
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Please listen to it.

349
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I have a suggestion.

350
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
I have a suggestion.

351
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,680
We don't have enough information for the show.

352
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,680
We have a new project.

353
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
But I don't want to be the only one to be the guest speaker.

354
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
I have a suggestion.

355
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
I have a suggestion.

356
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,680
We need to have a positive mindset.

357
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,680
We need to have a positive mindset.

358
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Are you talking about me?

359
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Ms. Haruko.

360
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Why are you here?

361
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Are you here to write the script?

362
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
No.

363
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I'm here as your son's guardian.

364
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Son's guardian?

365
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Our audition is coming.

366
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Here it is.

367
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Thank you for your cooperation.

368
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Thank you.

369
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Let's go to the audition.

370
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Please erase the mark.

371
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
You can't do that.

372
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,680
You look so happy.

373
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Thank you.

374
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,680
I've learned that I need to change from what you said.

375
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm glad that you did.

376
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
I'll do my best.

377
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I'll do my best too.

378
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
My phone.

379
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
It's rare.

380
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You can be the first one to be invited to audition.

382
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,680
And you can enjoy the time that you've been waiting for.

383
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,680
The first audition.

384
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
This is amazing.

385
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
I thought I would be with my father.

387
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
But I'm embarrassed.

388
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,680
So I asked Chiaki to come.

389
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
It's an honor.

390
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm so happy that we can drink together.

391
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Thank you.

392
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,680
I'm not good at walking.

393
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
I'll go straight.

394
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:48,680
A boy I know asked me about my father.

395
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
He said something strange.

396
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
He said, what do you think of this?

397
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Take me to the restaurant.

398
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Take me shopping.

399
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
He said I should be independent.

400
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,680
But he said I should come with you.

401
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Did he say that?

402
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
No.

403
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,680
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Why are you apologizing?

405
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,680
What did you think when you heard that?

406
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Did you get angry?

407
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,680
At first, I didn't get angry.

408
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,680
But I felt sorry for him.

409
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
I see.

410
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
I see.

411
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,680
As a father, I should be the one to be sorry.

412
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,680
But I'm not.

413
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I'm not.

414
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm not.

415
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,680
I don't think you should apologize.

417
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,680
I think the relationship between parents and children is not bad.

418
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Really?

419
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Compared to the past,

420
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
you were more relaxed.

421
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,680
You were rebellious.

422
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,680
I think your father was poor.

423
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
He didn't know how to take care of his daughter.

424
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Poor?

425
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:27,680
I think he thought he had to take care of his mother.

426
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,680
But he didn't know how to take care of his father and daughter.

427
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,680
He didn't want to take care of his daughter.

428
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,680
You did your best.

429
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
So?

430
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Did you change?

431
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,680
After I left home,

432
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:03,680
I didn't think about it.

433
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,680
What do you mean?

434
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,680
I changed my mind when I was a kid.

435
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,680
When I was a kid,

436
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,680
I wanted to talk to my mother.

437
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,680
But I couldn't tell my father.

438
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,680
I knew he was the worst.

439
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,680
I didn't want to make him sad.

440
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:50,680
But I didn't want to see my father trying so hard.

441
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,680
I was alone.

442
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,680
I was always with my father.

443
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
You're so funny.

445
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I think I know my parents' love and family's gratitude.

446
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm happy now.

447
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I don't know what to do.

448
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,680
I'm not good at talking.

449
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,680
But I love my family.

450
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Is that not good?

451
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Father.

452
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,680
No.

453
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,680
That's enough.

454
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
It hurts.

456
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,680
I'm so happy.

457
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Stop it.

458
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
I'm sorry.

459
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm sorry.

460
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
I'm an adult now.

461
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm a great adult.

462
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,680
But I still want to be an adult.

463
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm not an adult.

464
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm an adult.

465
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm an adult.

466
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm an adult.

467
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm an adult.

468
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,680
I'm an adult.

469
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm happy.

470
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm sorry.

471
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I'm sorry.

473
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:50,920
64

476
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,320
Let's stop

477
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm good

478
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Sorry for theora

479
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,280
Sa laughs

480
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,000
Bird

481
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,200
Wander

482
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,680
Cool

483
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Thank you

484
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,680
Looking good

485
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:29,620
F

486
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,240
Is it beautiful?

487
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
The future of Love is filled with looks

488
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,720
So lovely

489
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,600
Hey, Mr. CHUNG

490
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Can we move over to your side please?

491
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,140
Yea yea

492
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,600
Mr. CHUNG, the ease is yours

493
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,660
Ok Mr. Lai-ya did it

494
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,600
Go ahead

495
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Looking ahead

496
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,840
Wow!

497
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,460
What a great woman

498
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,440
Carry on

499
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,640
My type, wow, rock on

500
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,040
Why didn't I expect this to happen?

501
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
This never happened before

502
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
But this is fate

503
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Is this a hot spring?

504
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Ms. Hayata, what's wrong?

505
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Kura-chan

506
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Good work

507
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,440
I want to go to the restaurant

508
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Really?

509
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
Yes

510
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Ms. Hayata, please come here

511
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
This way

512
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Are you going up the stairs?

513
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Yes, I am

514
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Excuse me

515
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
The kitchen is small

516
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,240
and there are few ingredients

517
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
I don't want to waste time

518
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I'll go to the kitchen and prepare the ingredients

519
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,240
This is just an example

520
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
I didn't hear you

521
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,240
I have a dream of becoming a staff or a staff

522
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,240
I graduated from university and got married right away

523
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,240
From then on, I will work as a husband and live abroad

524
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore

525
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
That's amazing

526
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I'm sorry

527
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I'm talking about a woman

528
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Are you okay?

529
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I'm fine

530
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm sorry

531
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,240
You think I'm a troublesome woman, don't you?

532
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Don't deny it

533
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I think so too

534
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm not able to control myself

535
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
and I'm not able to control my own actions

536
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I feel like I'm being manipulated

537
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
My parents couldn't have children

538
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
I wanted to have children

539
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,240
but I couldn't have them

540
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,240
I tried to get rid of all the problems

541
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,240
but I couldn't

542
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,240
I couldn't see the end

543
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,240
I couldn't get the result

544
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,240
but I felt like I was a friend to my husband

545
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
My husband told me

546
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
I think it's okay

547
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Let's enjoy life without children

548
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
It's not too late

549
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Life is longer from now on

550
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I said yes

551
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
I married a good man

552
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,240
I thought I made the right choice in life

553
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I was happy from then on

554
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,240
You're not a bad man at all

555
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,240
My husband passed away six months ago

556
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
I found out after he died

557
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,240
I had four children

558
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
I had four children

559
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
My husband was a bad man

560
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,240
I was impressed by him

561
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
I thought he was a bad man

562
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
I had two children

563
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
You're a bad man

564
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm sorry

565
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm sorry

566
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,240
My life has been so messy

567
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
I'm very serious

568
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,240
I always think about

569
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,240
whether it's right to say it or not

570
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,240
I think about it

571
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
and make the right choice

572
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I think I can be happy if I live a honest life

573
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
But

574
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
I think this is the answer

575
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I think I have a thought

576
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I want to destroy myself

577
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,240
I want to say

578
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,240
I want to be a bad person

579
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,240
This is my revenge

580
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,240
I can't do it without it

581
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Do you understand?

582
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,240
I think I understand

583
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm so glad

584
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I've never talked to anyone before

585
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Are you okay?

586
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
I'm sorry

587
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
It's okay

588
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Please

589
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
What?

590
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Please don't do this

591
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Please destroy me in many ways

592
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
I think I can make it

593
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Please

594
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
I...

595
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm so relieved

596
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm so happy

597
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,240
I don't think I can accept it

598
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
The egg is in my mouth

599
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Are you okay?

600
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Let me wipe it

601
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,240
You must be tired

602
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
I'm so tired

603
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Okay

604
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Take care

605
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Don't be worried

606
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm very busy

607
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Really?

608
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Five, four, three, two, one.

609
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,240
So,

610
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,640
I'm the only one here.

611
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,520
Welcome.

612
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm the only one here.

613
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,560
Hello, sir.

614
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,160
Hello.

615
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,320
Please come in.

616
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,120
I'm glad to see you again.

617
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,640
Thank you for coming.

618
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,360
Excuse me.

619
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,920
I've always wanted to see you.

620
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm so lucky.

621
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,600
You're so easy to control.

622
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,800
Please forgive me.

623
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,560
Excuse me.

624
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,160
Okay.

625
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,760
But that man is a bastard.

626
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,440
I couldn't have a child.

627
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,800
I understand the feeling of a couple.

628
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,440
But that man is a bastard.

629
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,040
Yes.

630
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,840
There is no such thing as a man in Kamakura.

631
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,560
Is that word popular in Kamakura?

632
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,280
Yes.

633
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,480
You're so popular in Kamakura.

634
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,160
Please stop.

635
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,120
I'm not popular.

636
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,160
What is it?

637
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,280
You're the one who's calling me.

638
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,360
Me?

639
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,160
Yes, you're the one.

640
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,960
But you're not here.

641
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,160
What?

642
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
You and I are both men.

643
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,760
We're in the same situation as the unarmed.

644
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,560
Yes.

645
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,160
Some people decide to live on their own.

646
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,160
But we don't have such strength.

647
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,960
Right?

648
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Yes.

649
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,560
I think I can see that the door is open.

650
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,160
I think so.

651
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,560
Thank you.

652
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Excuse me.

653
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,480
We've lived in the same situation as the unarmed.

654
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,680
Yes.

655
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm so happy to meet you this year.

656
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,360
I know.

657
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,960
We've met before.

658
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Yes, we have.

659
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
We've met before.

660
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Excuse me.

661
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
What if...

662
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
What if...

663
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,080
What if you met someone who looks like your wife?

664
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,680
What?

665
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,280
Someone who looks like my wife?

666
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm not your wife.

667
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
But I can feel your romance.

668
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Yes.

669
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
That's right.

670
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,800
I met someone who looks like you.

671
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm a patient.

672
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm so happy.

673
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
What's wrong?

674
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
What's wrong?

675
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
What's wrong?

676
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
I told you the truth.

677
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,320
You look like my wife.

678
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,320
So I have to look at your face.

679
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
I'm sorry if I offended you.

680
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I'm a man of Kamakura.

681
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,320
I think I'm saying the same thing.

682
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
The problem is...

683
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
I know.

684
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
I know.

685
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
I know.

686
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
I know.

687
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
But I'm not your wife.

688
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
I know.

689
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
But...

690
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
I want to see you.

691
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,840
I want to see your face.

692
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
I'm so happy.

693
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
I'm so happy.

694
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
I'm so happy.

695
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Let's drink when you're drunk.

696
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Yes.

697
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
I'll drink with you.

698
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
No.

699
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
No.

700
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
No.

701
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,360
You should drink with your friend.

702
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
I don't know what to say.

703
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,360
You can't stop drinking.

704
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,360
That's right.

705
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,360
How about now?

706
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I don't know.

707
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,880
But I don't know what to say.

708
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,880
There are many people around you.

709
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Yes.

710
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't think I can get enough of you.

711
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
You too.

712
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Thank you.

713
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,880
People in the past said that age is a thing.

714
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
My grandmother said that.

715
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,880
But even if you age, many things will happen.

716
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm not bored.

717
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,400
There are good and bad things.

718
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:08,400
But I'm happy because there are good things.

719
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
There are many things.

720
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
I'm struggling.

721
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
But life is fun.

722
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Yes.

723
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
There are many things.

724
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
There are many things.

725
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,920
But life is fun.

726
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Yes.

727
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,920
There was a person named Mika.

728
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,920
He was a senior in the police department.

729
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,920
He was engaged in business with Keiko.

730
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
What did he do?

731
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Yes.

732
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
He was a good person.

733
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
That's right.

734
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
I understand.

735
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I met him at a TV station.

736
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,920
We had tea together.

737
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
He was cool as usual.

738
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I see.

739
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,920
He said he was working hard to start a production company.

740
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Chiaki,

741
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,920
you didn't make any promise or make any contract, right?

742
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
No, I didn't.

743
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
That's good.

744
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
What do you mean?

745
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
It's not a coincidence.

746
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
I went to see Chiaki.

747
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
I wanted to trick him.

748
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
What?

749
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,920
At first, I wanted to start a company,

750
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,920
but I couldn't get a job.

751
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,920
I wanted to work hard like Chiaki,

752
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
but I couldn't get a job.

753
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
I hired someone like that

754
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,920
to pay my retirement fund and the rest.

755
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,920
I invested the money.

756
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
That's what I did.

757
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Really?

758
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Wait a minute.

759
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,920
I'm not a good person anymore.

760
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
I'm not a good person anymore.

761
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm sorry.

762
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,920
It's not that you're bad.

763
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
We introduced you to him.

764
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
I'm so sorry that you think so.

765
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,920
We should be careful.

766
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
I'm sorry.

767
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm not bad.

768
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Wait a minute.

769
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,920
I was so happy.

770
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,920
You understand me.

771
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,920
You took a good look at my work.

772
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,920
I looked it up.

773
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,920
What's that?

774
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
What's that?

775
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Really?

776
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,920
I'm a little disappointed.

777
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,920
I'm a little disappointed.

778
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,920
I feel like I'm a little person.

779
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm a little disappointed.

780
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Thank you.

781
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
The champagne is delicious.

782
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
You're going to drink it?

783
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Thank you.

784
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
I drank a lot today.

785
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,920
I'm back by train.

786
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Don't be angry.

787
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Will you listen to me?

788
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Will you listen to me?

789
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm going to go to the house.

790
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,920
I'm going to lock the door.

791
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
It's closed.

792
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Is there a cell phone?

793
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,920
No cell phone.

794
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
No cell phone.

795
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm so sorry.

796
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
I'm so sorry.

797
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,920
I was so happy.

798
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,920
I'm so sorry.

799
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,920
I'm so sorry.

800
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
I'm so sorry.

801
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Liar.

802
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Liar.

803
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
It's the police.

804
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Wait.

805
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Mr. Yoshino.

806
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Mr. Yoshino.

807
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
Mr. Yoshino.

808
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I'm going to the police.

809
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,920
The police will be here soon.

810
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
They will be here soon.

811
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
The police will be here soon.

812
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
I'm going in.

813
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm going in.

814
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Wait.

815
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Mr. Yoshino.

816
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,920
Mr. Yoshino, are you okay?

817
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Mr. Yoshino.

818
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
I'm going in.

819
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Mr. Yoshino.

820
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm going in.

821
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,920
Was it a bad joke?

822
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm going in.

823
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
I'm going in.

824
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
I'm going in.

825
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
I'm going in.

826
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm going in.

827
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm going in.

828
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm going in.

829
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm going in.

830
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm going in.

831
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
I'm going in.

832
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm going in.

833
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm going in.

834
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm going in.

835
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm going in.

836
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Even if we can't understand each other.

837
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Even if we're apart.

838
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Tonight.

839
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,920
We'll make it in time for the dance.

840
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Even if we don't have anything.

841
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
Even if we just lose it.

842
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Tonight.

843
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,920
We'll make it in time for the dance.

844
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm going in.

845
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
You're going in too.

846
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Why me?

847
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,920
I was really cute.

848
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
You're like an old man.

849
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
I'm Chiyaki's mother.

850
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
What's going on with her?

851
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Chiyaki is a lucky woman.

852
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,920
I'm having fun with her.

853
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,920
I'm your daughter's fiancee.

854
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,920
I'm going in.

855
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
I'm going in.

856
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,920
You're going to do it with me.

857
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
I'm going in.

858
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,920
You're going to do it with me.

859
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
You're going to do it with me.

860
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,520
I wonder if I can do it

861
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:04,120
I wonder if I can live without giving up today for that
