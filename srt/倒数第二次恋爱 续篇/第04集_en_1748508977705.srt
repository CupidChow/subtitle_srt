1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry for inviting you so late.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Mr. Lee.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Actually, I have something to apologize to you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Apologize to me?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, I lost my wife 10 years ago.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But I thought she was the most beautiful person in the world.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I thought she was the most beautiful person in the world.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry for my wife.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Wow.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She's the best wife.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't know what to say.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is it true?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I thought I would feel so lonely when I grow up.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is a picture of my wife.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We are all the same.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Huh?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're surprised, aren't you?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You look like her, right?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not saying it myself, but you look like her, don't you?

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I saw a hole in the train a while ago.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was driving by bicycle.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then I saw you in the train.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're stupid.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I thought you were alive for a while, but you were in the hospital.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I was surprised.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is that so?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was surprised because you were in the police station.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I see.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Is that so?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was surprised.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was a little bit worried.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I thought I shouldn't look at you so much.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I thought you were looking at me.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I see.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You were surprised, weren't you?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm really sorry.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will introduce you to other hospitals and clinics.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is that so?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you a Kamakura-born, a Kamakura-grower?

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, that's right.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you serious about Kamakura-men?

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How about that?

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sure Kamakura-men are like that.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kamakura-men?

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you like to see my face?

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or you think of sad things?

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, that's not true.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's no sad memory.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The only thing that can kill me is that I'm like that.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There's a life that I can love.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's good.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Please, if you don't mind.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't mind.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm not saying that I don't like you.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm just saying that you're like me.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you saying?

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm just saying that you're like me.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I thought you were worried about me.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, I'm sorry.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm really sorry.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You look like me, but you're not.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You look like me.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're so fast.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can I take a picture with you?

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm from Nagano.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My mother-in-law came to me and said that she was worried about me.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't believe what she said.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to report that she's living happily in this place.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Can I take a picture with you?

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I found a teacher who's so nice.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Please be my teacher.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Would you like to leave Kamakura?

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to the police station soon.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've been doing a lot of things, and I thought there was no next time.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I thought there was no police.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I decided that you were the only one who was there.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, but I...

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Shut up.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Please stop responding immediately.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's your fault anyway.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not that kind of person.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not that kind of person.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can't do it.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll respond immediately.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's right.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can't do it.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's right.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll respond.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's say you're going to be in the hospital for May 29.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I won't respond.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But I...

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I won't change even if I leave you alone.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Please think about it and worry about it.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you okay, Nagakura?

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're the same person you think you are.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I think Kamakura is important to you.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm saying that you're the one who's good.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's a reason for that.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because you're the head of Kamakura.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't think you should be in the government office or the Kachigin

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
or Kanagawa prefecture.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's impossible.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Kamakura is the job of the head of Kamakura.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is it your job to worry?

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you think it's for you?

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think it's a good thing to worry about.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think it's a good thing to have love.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not a problem for a normal person.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm just thinking about it.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But you're wrong.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're always in trouble.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I don't think there's much for you, Nagakura.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm invited to be a viewer.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
First, think about it.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then, taste the time you're looking forward to.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can say it.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The world should be different.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Please.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I understand.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I accept that the viewer thinks it's for you.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'd like you to think it over.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But on May 29,

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
it was your birthday.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What does that mean?

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I thought it was hard to say it on that day.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Congratulations on your birthday.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's hard to say it.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why?

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm looking forward to choosing which one to choose.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know if I should choose.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then,

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll choose either the viewer or me.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why are you talking about those two?

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to take a picture.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm going to take a picture.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to take a picture.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm going to take a picture.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going to take a picture.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm going to take a picture.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm going to take a picture.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm going to take a picture.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to take a picture.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to take a picture.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to take a picture.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm going to take a picture.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm going to take a picture.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm going to take a picture.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm going to take a picture.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going to take a picture.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What are you doing?

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was watching the viewer's poster and laughing.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Me?

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is that so?

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Is that so?

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What?

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Did you do that?

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's not a big deal.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you talking about?

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What are you talking about?

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What are you talking about?

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What are you talking about?

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not going to do that.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What are you doing today?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm going to take a picture.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to take a picture.

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, are you going to take a picture?

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going to take a picture.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Can I go?

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Can I go?

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is this the right way?

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Did you have trouble again?

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did I look like that?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No, you didn't.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're right.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not a Kamakura guy.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm a Kamakura guy.

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm a Kamakura guy.

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was told that I was the most beautiful person in the world.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's why I'm not talking about you.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is that so?

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think that's why you're saying that you're the most beautiful person in the world.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's not true.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why?

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know what happened, but someone in the world is the most beautiful person in the world.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And Yushino is similar to that person.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So even if you're the most beautiful person, you're the most beautiful person in the world.

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm just saying that you're similar to that person.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I think that's good.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So, 52, 65, 1152.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're so mean, old man.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What do you mean, old man?

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, no.

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you okay?

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not okay.

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not on the right path.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please fix this.

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm not the one who was told that.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I worked so hard for Kamakura, so please fix this.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think something's up.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think something's up.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I finally have a physical relationship.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's the worst.

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Please fix this.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not good at this.

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I hate this the most.

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm worried about my family.

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Recently, Kamakura is amazing.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She's a tourist from overseas.

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's cheap.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Japan is cheap now.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, it feels strange.

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's our generation.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Really.

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When I was young, I went to Hong Kong with my friend.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I went to buy something cheap.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I wonder how it was.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This country is like that.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sure the young people don't know about this.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, I see.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to take a picture.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Can I take a picture?

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Are you two friends?

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going to take a picture.

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is the sea a country?

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is your face a little stiff?

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, it is.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's hard.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What do you do with that picture?

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm going to take a picture of my parents.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm going to take a picture.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to take a picture.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm on a date with a friend.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I haven't taken a picture yet.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wait a minute.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I haven't taken a picture yet.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's like my picture.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You should take a picture of me.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you mean?

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm not good at it.

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What?

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I wonder what's wrong with you.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What?

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What should I do?

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're going to be a member.

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can't go on like this.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't have to go on.

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll be like this forever.

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll be like this forever.

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's wrong with you?

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not going to do anything.

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm going to take a picture.

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is it a friend?

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes, it's a friend.

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm going to be with you forever.

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't you want to talk to me?

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sure.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll talk to you later.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's wrong?

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't think I have to go to the office.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think something's wrong.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's okay. Let's go out.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's Chiaki.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Chiaki?

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And the big brother.

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a long black horse.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's a full name.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's just me.

295
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Wait a minute.

296
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Cheese.

297
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you.

300
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I took it.

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm in trouble.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Thank you.

303
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll be back.

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Shinpei.

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You...

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Wait a minute.

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hello?

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Help me.

309
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Kura.

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I lost my husband.

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I understand your feelings.

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What's going on?

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hello, everyone.

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We're going to have tea.

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Kura.

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Kura.

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So...

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
She's...

319
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
a beauty.

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes?

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
She's a single person.

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Other people are family, friends, and husband.

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But she's a beauty.

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
She's alone.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
She must have been lonely and upset.

326
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
She must have been upset.

327
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
She's been fighting with other people.

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
She's a beauty.

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So...

330
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Is that so?

331
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, Kura.

332
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Can I ask you something?

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Did you ask me what we were going to call each other?

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was asked by Kura.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No, I was the only one who decided.

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
My father called me.

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So I thought I'd ask him to do it.

339
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't think that's a stone.

340
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's what I thought.

341
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I thought he was kind and suspicious.

342
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes, he was.

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was busy at work.

344
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You know, Hayato-san.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He's a fast guy.

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I want to be called.

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I want to be called.

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You know,

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Kura knew I was a beauty.

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
She was jealous of me.

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So she had a bad relationship with me.

352
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She was jealous of me.

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I think I was wrong.

354
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think I have a bad relationship with you.

355
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think so.

356
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I think it's my father's will.

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was the one who hid the number of beauties.

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I was the one who hid them.

359
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was the one who hid them.

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Kura-chan, I asked you to take the risk.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're wrong.

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You're wrong about the stone.

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can't say why I'm wrong.

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't have a reason to say it.

365
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But I want you to be called.

366
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm the one who was called.

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I might be beaten.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I won't be called.

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please be careful.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Of course.

371
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll leave it to you.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I told you three times that I was the worst.

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know what happened.

374
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I wonder if it's a misunderstanding.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't you hear me?

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't think it's a good thing to hear.

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is that a misunderstanding?

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes.

379
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hayata-san, come back soon.

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes.

381
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll talk to you slowly this time.

382
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't leave you at that time.

383
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I have to take care of you.

384
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Thank you.

385
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, wait a minute.

386
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hayata-san, wait a minute.

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Dad, come here.

388
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Why is my mom around?

389
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can only say it.

390
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm the worst if someone sees me like this.

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm a sweet man.

392
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Where were you?

393
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was bitten by a snake.

394
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm not okay.

395
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't tell everyone, so I might get sick.

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Which one is it?

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I have to go.

398
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Kura-chan!

399
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Wait a minute.

400
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm done.

401
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm done.

402
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't want to be in trouble.

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't want to be in trouble.

404
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't want to be in trouble.

405
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Thank you.

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Thank you.

407
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What happened?

408
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Well,

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
we have to organize the new drama.

410
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Our new drama season 7

411
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
was...

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
okay.

413
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What?

414
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What?

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What?

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What's wrong with you?

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It seems that we will be able to see

418
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the 25 to 30% of the drama.

419
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Wow.

420
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Wow.

421
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But,

422
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the story starts here, Mitsui-san.

423
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

424
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I know.

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's that.

426
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Originally, it was a small-scale drama.

427
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But, the number of the drama is increasing.

428
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But,

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
it's not increasing.

430
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I see.

431
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And,

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
we have to act without money.

433
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hey!

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hey!

435
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey!

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey!

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I always say this.

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sakuma-kun, too.

443
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What?

444
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've been like this for a long time.

445
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't feel anything special.

446
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I see.

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm jealous of your heart.

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well,

449
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
we have to do this.

450
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's work together and do our best.

451
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you.

452
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Thank you.

453
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay.

454
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm not in a mood for this.

455
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What?

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What?

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That...

459
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That!

460
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That!

461
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That!

462
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That!

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll take this.

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thank you.

465
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you.

466
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank you.

467
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Thank you.

468
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Thank you.

469
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Welcome.

470
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh, it's your wife, Noriko.

471
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's delicious.

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Welcome.

473
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, it's your wife, Noriko.

474
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
She's the sister of the long-awaited sister of Shimpie.

475
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sure it's Noriko.

476
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yes.

477
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And what was it?

478
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's a pumpkin.

479
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, I was being examined by my husband at the hospital.

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, it's a pumpkin, teacher.

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
How are you, teacher?

482
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What?

483
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Good morning.

484
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Good morning.

485
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Good morning.

486
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's get rid of the pumpkin.

487
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What's wrong?

488
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What's wrong?

489
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll tell you.

490
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know, right?

491
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
When Mariko is having a problem,

492
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
you know, right?

493
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Because we've been together for a long time.

494
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
How kind.

495
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's exactly this thing that Mariko has to have a face that she can't match with Chiyuki.

496
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What's wrong?

497
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Huh?

498
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Did I make you confused again?

499
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I said to give you a plan.

500
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You've been working on a movie before.

501
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
When you said to do it alone.

502
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm happy now.

503
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Rather than jumping out into a different world,

504
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm happy to work hard in this world.

505
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I thought it would be nice to have a plan with me this time.

507
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Chiyuki is not a bad person.

509
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I just don't know.

510
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What do you mean?

511
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I thought Chiyuki wanted to do something interesting.

512
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I thought that I could show her how to do it.

513
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But...

514
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't want to do it alone.

515
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm a monster.

516
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I see.

517
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I understand.

518
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm proud of you.

520
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not ashamed.

521
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm not ashamed of it.

522
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Really?

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes.

524
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What is it?

527
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry for not crying.

528
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm sorry for not crying.

529
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm crying.

530
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You're growing.

533
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm growing?

534
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I like you.

535
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I tried my best to answer your expectations.

536
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I think I got the first motivation.

537
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I'm growing.

538
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I want to write for myself.

539
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think I'm growing.

540
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm trying to be a father to my parents.

541
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't want to grow.

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't want to grow.

543
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I can't stop it if I live my life.

544
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I can't stop it.

545
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I found the key.

548
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I can't say I can't leave you.

549
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't worry.

550
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I want to think like this.

551
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I want to write for Mariko someday.

552
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I want to make it funny.

553
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm worried about you.

554
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I want to grow.

555
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I want to be a mother to my parents.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Thank you.

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let's cry together.

558
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm sad.

559
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm crying.

560
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm crying.

561
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm crying.

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll take a picture with you.

563
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'll take a picture with you.

564
00:29:48,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'll take a picture with you.

565
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I can't stop it.

566
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm not a garbage stepper.

567
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'll take a picture with you.

568
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I can't do it.

569
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I can't do it.

570
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I can't do it.

571
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Thank you.

572
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Good morning.

573
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Good morning.

574
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Good morning.

575
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Good morning.

576
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Good morning.

577
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Good morning.

578
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't tell me.

579
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm worried about you.

580
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm so jealous.

581
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,000
Mariko, did you have a good time today?

582
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Hello.

583
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What's up?

584
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I have a job.

585
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Why are you kidding me?

586
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What's up with you?

587
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm so happy to see you.

588
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll do my best.

589
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Good morning, Chiaki.

590
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Good morning, Chiaki.

591
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Good morning.

592
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Good morning.

593
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You're doing a great job.

594
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Why are you so different from me?

595
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm hungry.

596
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Good morning.

597
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm having a good meal.

598
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm having a good meal.

599
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Can I take a picture with you?

600
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
What?

601
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's a rare photo.

602
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm good.

603
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm good.

604
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Cheese.

605
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Thank you.

606
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Which one is the best friend next to you?

607
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You're so fast today.

608
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm sure.

609
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Really?

610
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes.

611
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I've been in the club for a long time.

612
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I've been in the club for a long time.

613
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I've been in the club for a long time.

614
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Wait.

615
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I've never been in the club.

616
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's okay.

617
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm in the club for a long time.

618
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You're so fast.

619
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yes.

620
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I was angry.

621
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I was angry.

622
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I was angry.

623
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I was angry.

624
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What?

625
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What?

626
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't know what you're asking me.

627
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What's wrong?

628
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I've been in the club for a long time.

629
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I was angry and angry.

630
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I was afraid of it.

631
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I've cried a lot.

632
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Really?

633
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, just once.

634
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What should I say?

635
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The rules are almost wrong.

636
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The correctness is more obvious.

637
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm not good at it.

638
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What do you mean?

639
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I've never seen the right club.

640
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I've never seen the right club.

641
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I've never seen the right club.

642
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I was angry.

643
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What?

644
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Do your best.

645
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What?

646
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Who is this?

647
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's you, right?

648
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You're a good girl.

649
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm not good at it.

650
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Let's go.

651
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm not good at it.

652
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not good at it.

653
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You're not good at it.

654
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm not good at it.

655
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You're definitely not good at it.

656
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
What did I do?

657
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You should have been more understanding.

658
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What?

659
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You just got mad at me.

660
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
What?

661
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
What?

662
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
No, no, no.

663
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's not like that.

664
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's like that.

665
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's like that.

666
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You're a bad guy.

667
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You're a bad guy.

668
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's right.

669
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You're a bad guy.

670
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What?

671
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Sit down.

672
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm in a hurry.

673
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Hurry up.

674
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Me?

675
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
No, no.

676
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You're a bad guy.

677
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm sorry.

678
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're running away, right?

679
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What?

680
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You said that you're gone, right?

681
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What?

682
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What?

683
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Why don't you tell us?

684
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
What?

685
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You've been a bad guy since you were a kid.

686
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Why don't you tell us?

687
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
No.

688
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I forgot.

690
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Shut up.

691
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Sit down.

692
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You called your wife, right?

693
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You said you're gone.

694
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You said you wanted to live with your family,

695
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
but you called her, right?

696
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You said you had a word with your teacher.

697
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But you didn't tell her.

698
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And you're still quiet to us.

699
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I know.

700
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I know what you're thinking.

701
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You're suddenly scared, right?

702
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
People?

703
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's what I'm thinking.

704
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So let's not ask.

705
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Isn't that right?

706
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No?

707
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Which one?

708
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Maybe.

709
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
First of all, you shouldn't say that to your teacher.

710
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You should be a person.

711
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's natural to say a word to a person who's been a bad guy.

712
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You shouldn't do anything stupid,

713
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
or stupid, or stupid.

714
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Isn't that right?

715
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
If you're wrong, say it.

716
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yes.

717
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You're thinking like this.

718
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You're a family.

719
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You don't know how you feel.

720
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You don't know us.

721
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That's right.

722
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You don't know.

723
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But we're trying to understand.

724
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What's important is that we're trying to understand.

725
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Hey,

726
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you're making a wall.

727
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You're the one who's not making a wall.

728
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I can't forgive you.

729
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm so disappointed.

730
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Shinpei.

731
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You're right.

732
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You know that.

733
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You always say you didn't want to worry.

734
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You always say that when you're in love.

735
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That's what I hate the most.

736
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You're worried about your family.

737
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You're worried about me.

738
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm sad the most.

739
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Did you talk to Tomu?

740
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You idiot!

741
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You made it yourself!

742
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You're family, right?

743
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Go right ahead and tell her.

744
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Then,

745
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
meet up with Mr. Kadowaki and

746
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
ask him to forgive you.

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Listen to what he said.

748
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Don't ever come into this house until you do.

749
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We'll meet up with him.

750
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Hurry up.

751
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Shinpei.

752
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I can't let you two notice.

754
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm sorry.

755
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm sorry.

757
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sorry.

758
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm sorry.

760
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm sorry.

761
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm sorry.

762
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm hungry.

763
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm hungry.

764
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You're eating so fast.

765
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Let's get on.

766
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm hungry.

767
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Let's eat first.

768
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Let's eat.

769
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll eat.

770
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What's wrong?

771
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The group reservation.

772
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
2 tickets.

773
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
65 people.

774
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
65 people?

775
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm sorry.

776
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm sorry.

777
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm sorry.

778
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
How did you get here?

779
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Come to the face shop again.

780
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Thank you.

781
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Thank you.

782
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm sorry.

783
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You know,

784
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
you know,

785
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
if you lose your life,

786
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you'll be worried.

787
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I knew it.

788
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You were worried about me.

789
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You're back.

790
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You're back.

791
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah.

792
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I have to go.

793
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll be right back.

794
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Hey.

795
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What?

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I wanted to see the people of Nagakura Prefecture.

797
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I took a break from the contract.

798
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I went to the police station.

799
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
In Nagakura.

800
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
With everyone.

801
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Oh.

802
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You're going to treat everyone with dinner.

803
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah.

804
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'll have a dinner with my wife.

805
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah.

806
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh.

807
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What?

808
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
A bandit.

809
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
65 people.

810
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh, no.

811
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, no.

812
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh, no.

813
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh, no.

814
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, no.

815
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh, no.

816
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh, no.

817
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh, no.

818
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, no.

819
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm sorry.

820
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Oh, no.

821
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Shin-nii.

822
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm sorry.

823
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm sorry.

824
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Okay.

825
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Can I help you?

826
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Help me.

827
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Sorry.

829
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
10 seconds.

830
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
10 seconds.

831
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yuriko Yoshio, the former president.

832
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Mom, I'm fine.

833
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I know that the girl who lives alone at the age of 59 is worried.

834
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I know that.

835
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm worried about many things.

836
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But, you know,

837
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I think I'm pretty happy.

838
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm living well with these people.

839
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Chiaki.

840
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is KIOS成田.

841
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm going to dance.

842
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm not Brad Riot.

843
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm against him.

844
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We can't go to the pool tonight.

845
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's boring.

846
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Even if it's a chilly day.

847
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Even designation is fine.

848
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm a mania dance

849
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
If you don't give up

850
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Tonight, I'm a mania dance

851
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Even if we can't understand each other

852
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Even if we're apart

853
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Tonight, I'm a mania dance

854
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Even if we can't have anything

855
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Even if we lose everything

856
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Tonight, I'm a mania dance

857
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I went to see Chiaki and she was lying

858
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
YOSHIRO!

859
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I thought there was a new encounter

860
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But I think she likes me

861
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm an adult, I'm just like you

862
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Please destroy me in various ways

863
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, if you do it twice, you can bring sake and come

864
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm saying no

865
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm going to enter the stage
