1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A paper on hand provides the texture to suit your taste.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Every time the paper thought well comes about is proof of Chewing Man's who hard.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today, I would like to talk about the choices of life that will be taken in the next year.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, I would like to talk about what I want to do and what I want to challenge.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For you, life and work are both important.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's find a hint to spend a good second life.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Second life...

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What? You want to go again?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's like the second life.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, Kamakura is now in a big trouble because of the visitors from abroad.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not just the store management, but the citizens' opinions and methods are becoming difficult.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's like we're in trouble.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't it a joke?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As a tourist, Kamakura is a pinch from the world's three problems.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Please sign this address.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Just sign it and make it a form of a paper plate.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There is a sign saying that it's not in this place.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please sign it.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hi, I'm Tomomi.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm Ohashi.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to work at a restaurant for over 10 years.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please contact me at the tourist center.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Nagakura.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Nagakura.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is the price of the table?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Can I ask for the deposit of the clip?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The deposit of the clip?

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've got it.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll pay for the deposit.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The deposit?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's a time when he wants to be a member of the company.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I have to work hard.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If it's too much, I'll have to work hard from the back.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll help you at that time.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I understand.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to tell you everything.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Excuse me.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No picture here.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Please read this one.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Please read this one.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nagakura-san.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're so kind.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You didn't eat the dinner.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've had dinner once.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Look at this.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's working again.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He looks like he wants to be a guide.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He's still working.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll work harder.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Bye.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Excuse me.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Take care.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Welcome to Kamakura.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go again.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where are you?

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's call him.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey, grandpa.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't ignore him.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's so different.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is the dinner still cold?

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you eating properly?

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you okay?

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm worried about my mother.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's always like this.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's this house?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hello.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Welcome.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Please come in.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Excuse me.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Eri, please take the table in the back.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hello.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is it your father?

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, it's my father.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He's been away from work for a while.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's delicious.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What?

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's not that time.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm hungry.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Can I have a look at the menu?

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wait.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Here's the menu.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Excuse me.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll serve you the soup.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's this?

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is it made of wheat?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's cute.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why don't you sell it?

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's cute.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want it.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I want people to see it.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you sell it, you'll only be able to see it.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then, I'll be a little lonely.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm Shira Asuka.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Eat.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This way.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is the worst.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm in trouble again.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's delicious.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll eat it.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Excuse me.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll be right there.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll be back.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't come out.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't come out.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's dangerous.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's dangerous.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's big.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come on in.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come in.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Come on in.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Nagura.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't have enough Chinese to talk to.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I see.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I suddenly quit.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Excuse me.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Can you take this basketball and pose for us?

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What do you mean?

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Pose.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Pose.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can't pose.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can't pose.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, no.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You can't.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I thought I was lonely.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I felt uneasy.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Chiaki.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Michi.

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I've been thinking about what to do for a year.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But I thought it would take longer.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I just threw a ball.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you for your hard work.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's beautiful.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can I take this?

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Leave it to me.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please take this.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Thank you.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you for your hard work.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Bye.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This time, the producer of Eda has made a movie.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The director and the editor of the movie,

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
the movie Blue In Sezon.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The film was won by the best film award

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
at the MIRROR's independent film festival.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thank you.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Even so, the production crew

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is all alone.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think it's like a thousand-year-old.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I had to do everything because I didn't have money.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But,

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm looking forward to your cooperation.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm a man.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you love Chiaki?

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're welcome.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're welcome.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is my military certificate.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have a reservation for the shop where Eda wanted to go.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, let's all say Eda.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yay!

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What about Chiaki?

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have a schedule today.

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, please enjoy it.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you.

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What's your face?

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You look like a titan.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I saw it for the first time.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A girl is like a pocket money.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's not a small business.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't do it.

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's end it with your senior.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So, please enjoy it a lot because it may be the last day.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm looking forward to your cooperation.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The series is the best.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I want to go to season 55 if possible.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How many years do you think I'll be in?

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think it's a good day.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
How old are you?

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm 49 years old.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why are you so bright when you're 19?

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I've been watching you for 35 years.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've been watching you for 10 years.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm still in my early 20s.

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm still in my early 20s.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm still in my early 20s.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm going to face a lot of problems.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I see.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I see.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But this is a complicated thing.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
My heart is in my early 20s.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going to face a lot of difficulties.

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What will happen to me?

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was going to go home early today and fall asleep.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I can't help it.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm going to apologize for what I've done.

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll get angry if I don't apologize.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do your best.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What are you doing?

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wait a minute.

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
There's no way to do anything.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm glad I didn't die.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not a lonely adult.

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Adults have their own time.

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They have their own limits.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I know that there are great things that will never happen.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you for your help.

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm glad today.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've been living so hard to get a good old age.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, my.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm in trouble.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why is society so important to me?

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm afraid that I can't live without it.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't think so.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm looking at the back pocket of Denim's pants.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I found it.

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm glad.

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm glad I found it.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm glad I found it.

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm glad I found it.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I'm thinking about it.

261
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know if it's a logo or a second life.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If there's someone who can laugh and make it a story and live with it.

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I wonder if I can make it happen.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Whether it's family, husband, friends, or relatives.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've been living in that house for more than 10 years.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What's going on?

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's fast.

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's okay to be anything, but if someone is there,

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the guy who meets yesterday will be next to him.

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If you're going to call yourself the old man,

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
what kind of words would you say?

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Because I'm an adult, everything goes well.

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know if I'm going, so I'm walking.

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not saying it with time.

275
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I wonder if I can make a smile.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I won't give up today for that.

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you laughing at?

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Is it that the guy is not interested in everything?

279
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm scared.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're going to live with me forever.

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm going to think about it.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What will happen to me after this?

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Special Chief,

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I would like to announce the emergency declaration of the 32nd local government.

285
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The total number of 340 people in the country yesterday was confirmed.

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
25 people have been missing.

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's about time for the memorial ceremony.

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's been a long time.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Good morning, everyone.

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Good morning.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Naruko, how's the show?

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sleeping.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, I see.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not going home.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm fine, too.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, my God.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You were watching the children's show.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's the on-parade of the family.

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What is on-parade?

300
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Are you okay?

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm fine.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're going to be a bomb.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Be careful of other people.

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm fine.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Please be careful.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm a little strict.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Please be careful, Tomomi.

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm a little strict.

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm fine.

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You were there.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm fine.

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't think you can get in.

313
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Are you okay?

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're welcome.

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm home.

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I didn't see anyone walking in the town.

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I saw that town for the first time.

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Did you come back?

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm a college student.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm a college student.

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't even take a breath.

322
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going to be weird if I'm alone in the apartment.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's go together.

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Everyone, Eri-na is back.

325
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Welcome home.

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Welcome home.

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you.

328
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hello.

329
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Chiyaki?

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's wrong?

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Chiyaki.

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm a little...

334
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm a little sensitive to the flow.

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So...

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm in trouble.

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Wow.

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's wrong?

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Get on the floor.

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Chiyaki.

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Be careful.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Chiyaki.

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Excuse me.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Chiyaki.

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Mariko.

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to shoot.

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't come.

349
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Are you okay?

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't want to shoot anyone.

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Can you teach me the symptoms?

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll find someone to help me.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I was just about to say.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I was 38.8.

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
38.8?

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think I'm a little better now.

361
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Really?

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have a throatache.

363
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
A throatache?

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I have a fever.

365
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You're sure of it.

366
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I think so too.

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Are you okay?

368
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you okay?

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait.

370
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Did you stop the light?

372
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Did you see me?

373
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm sorry for the light.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What?

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll get angry if I say I don't see you.

377
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Are you okay?

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm okay.

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Mariko is going to the shrine next door.

380
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
She's praying for your recovery.

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Mariko.

382
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
God, please forgive me.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm here.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And...

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You promised me.

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll do anything.

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You're going to live with me, aren't you?

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm glad you keep it.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wait.

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't remember if you keep it.

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll go there when I have someone else.

392
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Can you hear me?

393
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm a good man to keep it.

394
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not a long-time waffling.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Shut up.

396
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Shut up?

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please be healthy.

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What do you want to do when the pandemic is over?

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll make a long-time waffling like usual.

400
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you okay?

401
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I've never been in a long-time waffling.

402
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Why are you so mean?

403
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's wrong?

404
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm a good man to keep it.

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm scared.

406
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm scared.

407
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Can I go in there?

408
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No, no, no.

409
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't have a bath.

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's not what you meant.

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I see.

412
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll stop.

413
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Take a rest.

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll be here until you wake up.

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll be there.

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Please sleep while I'm sleeping.

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're making me mad.

418
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Shut up.

419
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The End

420
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Good morning.

421
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The End

422
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Good morning.

423
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Good morning, big brother.

424
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is the set.

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Good morning, Elina.

426
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Good morning.

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is a set that Elina used to use.

428
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's a sakura-gai that her mother used to like.

429
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's been a while since I picked it up.

430
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But now, it's picked up.

431
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So I picked it up.

432
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't remember it right away.

433
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think I can use it for something.

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Good. Use it.

435
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'll go there.

436
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
When did you come in?

437
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I was waiting for you.

438
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Good morning.

439
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Good morning.

440
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What are you doing?

441
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You said you didn't know anything.

442
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm not sure if I know what's going on.

443
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I know.

444
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think it's okay.

445
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You're right.

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you say you know what's going on,

447
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I want to break the rule.

448
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll try to figure it out.

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I see.

450
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I don't know what's going on.

451
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What does that mean?

452
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You're right, Mario.

453
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I've been saying this since the morning.

454
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm not saying anything.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Good morning.

456
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Good morning, Chiaki.

457
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Good morning, Chiaki.

458
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I hope you can come to me.

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Good morning.

460
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I like you, Mario.

461
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm so moved.

462
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I've been living 300 years in my current language.

463
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I understand.

464
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Good morning.

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Coffee.

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You did that, too?

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
What was that?

468
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That was the one.

469
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, I see.

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You did that too?

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I did that.

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Until the end of my career,

473
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I did that until the end of my career.

474
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It was the morning of the day.

475
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's great.

476
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You don't have to say that.

477
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I said that on my birthday,

478
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
but I couldn't prepare for the Corona virus until the end of the year.

479
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I thought it was important to know how to treat it.

480
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I wanted to know how long it would last.

481
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I wanted to know how important it is to see it with your eyes.

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't want you to regret it.

483
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you.

484
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I was able to do it.

485
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I saw your literally meeting somewhere.

486
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Do you think you can slowly get bigger speeds?

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I think I am able to get on with it.

488
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That's why I'm doing this.

489
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I will be thinking it´s my record.

490
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You will always be concerned.

491
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The original market is about 6 atm and to start making tips like curing up,

492
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I need to carry to my peak.

493
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,200
That being said,

494
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,000
you will get faster each time you more powerful in your隊.

495
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I wonder if the foundation got thicker and the eyeliner was thick.

496
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't know the answer.

497
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll let you know that every morning.

498
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Wait, wait, wait.

499
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Was this a trick?

500
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes.

501
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I thought I forgot the answer.

502
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't know what to say.

503
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But, but,

504
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm sure you'll be okay without a thick makeup.

505
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sure you'll be okay.

506
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sure you'll be okay.

507
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What? What?

508
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm sure you're going to praise me, but it's not true.

509
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What?

510
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's what I'm saying.

511
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You're more adorable than a skin product.

512
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What do you think of this as a male character in a drama?

513
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It's very high-intensity.

514
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I heard the viewers' voice.

515
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Wait, wait, wait.

516
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This isn't a drama.

517
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't think it's a drama.

518
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's a family conversation.

519
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm sure you'll be praised.

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't know who's going to be the skin product.

521
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I think you should make it thicker.

522
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I think it's a problem.

523
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm sure you'll be okay with that.

524
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm sure you'll be okay with that.

525
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Here you go.

527
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Shinpei, dinner.

528
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll have a beer if I can.

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Okay, I'll have a beer if I can.

530
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Noriko, Noriko.

532
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Can't you just be a little more patient?

533
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Why are you wearing that now?

534
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Shut up.

535
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You're getting a headache again.

536
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll do my best.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll do my best.

538
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
If you do your best,

539
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
you'll be fine.

540
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I can't do my best.

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I want to do my best.

542
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'll do my best.

543
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Wait, wait, wait.

544
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Wait, wait, wait.

545
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What's going on?

546
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's not a drama.

547
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's a family conversation.

548
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's a family conversation.

549
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's a family conversation.

550
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's a family conversation.

551
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's a family conversation.

552
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Please be strong.

553
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You're being too harsh.

554
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What's up, bro?

555
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Did you have something important to talk about?

556
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hurry up.

557
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What's up with you?

558
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You're the one who's talking.

559
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's an important thing?

560
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yes.

561
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's an important thing?

562
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You know something.

563
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's about Chiyaki's makeup.

564
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, I don't need to do that.

565
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
If you can't say that,

566
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you can't say anything.

567
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You're saying that, right?

568
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes.

569
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So, a man

570
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
is a man who's not interested in everything?

571
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
There are many men in the world who are angry.

572
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I don't think anyone would think

573
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that women are stupid.

574
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't think so.

575
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't think women are stupid.

576
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't think women are stupid.

577
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There are many men in the world who are angry.

578
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But you're not like that.

579
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That's right.

580
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's because

582
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
the reason why women are angry

583
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
is because of the legendary incident.

584
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
A boy who was found in a room

585
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and was found by an old woman

586
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and was locked up for seven hours.

587
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's true.

588
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I knew it.

589
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I knew it.

590
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I want to know what it is.

591
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No, no.

592
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't want to know.

593
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's not like that.

594
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's not like that.

595
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm talking about the story of middle school.

596
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What?

597
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
What are you talking about?

598
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm not talking about anything.

599
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The long-awaited hero of middle school

600
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is a man who buys a hero book.

601
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
No, no.

602
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm not buying it.

603
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's suspicious.

604
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's like that.

605
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's what men say.

606
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That's true.

607
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I didn't buy it.

608
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That's suspicious.

609
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's not suspicious.

610
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's suspicious.

611
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Excuse me.

612
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Excuse me.

613
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
What?

614
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm sorry.

615
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm not in the right time.

616
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm sure I'm late.

617
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
What?

618
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What?

619
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What?

621
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Come here.

622
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Let me hear it.

623
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
The long-awaited hero of middle school.

624
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The hero book.

625
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Don't make a fuss about it.

626
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's a different story.

627
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's like a story about a boy who cried

628
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
because of the hero book.

629
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Wait, wait, wait.

630
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Are you laughing?

631
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Please listen to it slowly.

632
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's talk about the story of the hero book.

633
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm home.

634
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Welcome home.

635
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It was hard.

636
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah.

637
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What are you laughing at?

638
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This picture.

639
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's like a picture of a cabaclet.

640
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I thought you were a cabaclet.

641
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You're so mean.

642
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm going to the paper office later.

643
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'll get the number of people.

644
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'll look for a job.

645
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'll be there soon.

646
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You don't have to hurry so much.

647
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm not in a hurry.

648
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This is your father's luggage.

649
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah.

650
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Oh, Mr. Aho.

651
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yes, Yoshino.

652
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you for your hard work.

653
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Everyone should be careful.

654
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Mr. Aho is a real man.

655
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He calls me Mr. Aho.

656
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Be careful.

657
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Are you okay, Mr. Chiyaki?

658
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm okay.

659
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm okay.

660
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I've been through a lot.

661
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yes.

662
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But, Yoshino.

663
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm going to the paper office.

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What?

665
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm going to the paper office.

666
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm going to the paper office.

667
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm going to the paper office.

668
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I know what you're talking about.

669
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
What time is the paper office?

670
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's Monday 9 o'clock.

671
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Wow.

672
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Mr. Ato.

673
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
No, I'm scared.

674
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What are you talking about?

675
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm scared.

676
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What's wrong, Mr. Chiyaki?

677
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm scared.

678
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I told you.

679
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You were in the seminar the other day.

680
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yes.

681
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You must be thinking about it.

682
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What will I do after this?

683
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm going to do the Sarezuma Dome.

684
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm going to make a wish that I can stay here for a year.

685
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But I don't know if I can do it.

686
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And I'm going to do this.

687
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm going to make more and more.

688
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I want to do a live broadcast.

689
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Why don't you invite me to Netflix?

690
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yes, I do.

691
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I can do anything I want.

692
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't think I can do it.

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm afraid I'm going to be a loser.

694
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Hey, listen to me.

695
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't feel bad about what happened at that time.

696
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm going to say that I'm happy.

697
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But please don't do that.

698
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Please tell me clearly.

699
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't want to be a loser.

700
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But I'm afraid I'm going to be a loser.

701
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
If you ask me if I'm a loser,

702
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm sorry that I can't say that.

703
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Hey, Sakuma.

704
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's okay. I'll say it.

705
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Thank you.

706
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm happy that you said that.

707
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes.

708
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes.

709
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes.

710
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Please wait a minute.

711
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yes.

712
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yoshino.

713
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm from Yamamoto-san, Netflix.

714
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh, my God!

715
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's a joke.

716
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a joke.

717
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
What's going on?

718
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm afraid.

719
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm going to be a loser.

720
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm going to be a loser.

721
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You're amazing.

722
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm going to be a loser.

723
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm going to be a loser.

724
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm going to be a loser.

725
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yes, I'm back.

726
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Thank you.

727
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes.

728
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yes.

729
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes.

730
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Oh, so you want to use the drama I made a long time ago?

731
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes, I understand.

732
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Of course.

733
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm happy.

734
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

735
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Well,

736
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
will you kill the man who made a scene today?

737
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes, I will.

738
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I will.

739
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes.

740
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What are you doing?

741
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The continuation of the introduction is complete.

742
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Please bring this home.

743
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Thank you.

744
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Thank you for your hard work.

745
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Chief.

746
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000

Thank you.

755
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's bad.

756
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I noticed it a few years ago.

757
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Our company?

758
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
TV station, publisher, record company.

759
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's not bad.

760
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It shouldn't be like this.

761
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm sorry.

763
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I thought it was better.

764
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I thought it was better.

765
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I thought it was better.

766
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I thought it was better.

767
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I was told that there was a publisher in a young artist.

768
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I couldn't respond to anything.

769
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I was depressed.

770
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I understand.

771
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Do you have a TV miller?

772
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm told that.

773
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Music industry is also my basic.

774
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Music industry is also my basic.

775
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm a big brother.

776
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm a publisher.

777
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm a comic artist.

778
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm a comic artist.

779
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Thank you.

I'm a comic artist.

782
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm a comic artist.

783
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Thank you.

784
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Thank you.

785
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's bad.

786
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's bad.

787
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm sorry.

788
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I can't live without you.

789
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm sorry.

790
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Should we have a toast again?

791
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yes.

792
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Cheers.

793
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Let's do our best.

794
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm so angry recently.

795
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm really angry.

796
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm so angry.

797
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm so angry that I can't seem to come to a conclusion.

798
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You don't look like you're in a training camp.

799
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You know,

800
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I can't talk to you about your body somewhere.

801
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But the real problem is that you should find a partner in the neighborhood.

802
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, you're right.

803
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Which one?

804
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Which one?

805
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I mean, you found a partner.

806
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And you're like a man, right?

807
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And you're like a man who can tell which one you want.

808
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
One is a good guy, and the other is a man who doesn't want that kind of feeling.

809
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't want to be cool anymore.

810
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I want to be a good guy, and I want to be a good guy.

811
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I want to be a young teacher who can tell which one you want.

812
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't want to be a good guy.

813
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
No, no.

814
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because you're going to be a good guy in the future, right?

815
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I see.

816
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Which one?

817
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't want to be a good guy.

818
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm going to be a good guy.

819
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's the same as my grandma.

820
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
No, no.

821
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What are you talking about?

822
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's okay if you're fine.

823
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I see.

824
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I found a partner today.

825
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I found a partner today.

826
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I found a partner today.

827
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I found a partner today.

828
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I found a partner today.

829
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I found a partner today.

830
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I found a partner today.

831
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I found a partner today.

832
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I found a partner today.

833
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Where is my card?

834
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Where is my card?

835
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I didn't know you were angry.

836
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I always have different clothes.

837
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I thought I'd put it in the bag I had, but I couldn't find it.

838
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So I have it in my hand.

839
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you.

840
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
No problem.

841
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Which one is your clothes?

842
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
My boss.

843
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Is that one too?

844
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes.

845
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
My motivation.

846
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Have you ever been in trouble with your clothes?

847
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
What?

848
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think my neck is stiff.

849
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You've been in trouble with your clothes.

850
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Yes, I have.

851
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I think I've been in trouble with my clothes.

852
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I don't know.

853
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Shall we go?

854
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't know.

855
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Shall we go?

856
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I was in the theater at the time of the theater.

857
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I wasn't that close.

858
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I was in the theater at the time of the theater.

859
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I was in the theater at the time of the theater.

860
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I was in the theater at the time of the theater.

861
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Of course, I was in the same year as the young generation.

862
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I didn't have a license to go to the theater.

863
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I didn't know what I was doing.

864
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I didn't have a license to go to the theater.

865
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But today's trip was a trip.

866
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I was in the theater at the time of the theater.

867
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
My wife, who is the main character of the theater,

868
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
chased after me.

869
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
She said,

870
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Mr. Nakagura, Mr. Nakagura.

871
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
She was really grateful to have a master.

872
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
She said,

873
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Thank you very much.

874
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
She was very happy.

875
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I was surprised.

876
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I heard the story.

877
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
My childhood was two years old.

878
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I was always traveling with me every year.

879
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That's exactly what happened.

880
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't know.

881
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because I can't hear anymore.

882
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But that's right.

883
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I was in a setting that I liked to go around the hot spring.

884
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I thought I liked it.

885
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I thought I liked it.

886
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But my wife said,

887
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Mr. Nakagura, you have a license to go around the hot spring.

888
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I thought I could go around the hot spring.

889
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But you are not the one who is used to it.

890
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm not the one who is used to it.

891
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why am I the one who is used to it?

892
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I was in the past.

893
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I love you.

894
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Please go ahead.

895
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Okay.

896
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I think that's what I'm talking about.

897
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I heard that I'm the boss of the company.

898
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm not going to say anything else.

899
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
When I went to the cleaning department,

900
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I saw a face of people in the company and the management office.

901
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I looked at my face and saw it.

902
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
What?

903
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I saw it.

904
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I thought, are you okay?

905
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
What happened?

906
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I caught it because I had a motive.

907
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And the manager of the company said,

908
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm a good person.

909
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm a good person.

910
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Don't ask me.

911
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I heard that.

912
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm a good person.

913
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You're a good person.

914
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm a good person.

915
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm in a good position.

916
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm a good person because I have a motive.

917
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm a good person.

918
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm a bad person.

919
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You're a bad person.

920
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm a bad person.

921
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I thought I'd kill you.

922
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm a little nervous.

923
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm feeling good.

924
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Let's go.

925
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Thank you.

926
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What happened to you?

927
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You said you were a bad person.

928
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You said you were a bad person.

929
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Did you cut it off?

930
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
What?

931
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I think I was just like I said.

932
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But today, I said,

933
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm not a bad person.

934
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I think you should have said that.

935
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Because you don't have a partner to take care of.

936
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I know.

937
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
But I didn't want to lie to myself.

938
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I thought I'd be rude to the woman in front of me.

939
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I regretted it.

940
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I thought I was just hurt.

941
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm glad.

942
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I see.

943
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
But you know what?

944
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a bad person.

945
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I think I was like that.

946
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But I couldn't say anything.

947
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm a good person.

948
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I always call myself a bad person.

949
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I said I was a bad person when I saw your face.

950
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I said I'm not a bad person.

951
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'm a bad person.

952
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I said I was going to be a bad person.

953
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I regretted it.

954
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I thought I was good.

955
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I thought I was going to be a bad person.

956
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I think entertainment is like that.

957
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I didn't say anything.

958
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I didn't say anything.

959
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But I'm a bad person.

960
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm not good at it.

961
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Do you have a new or old date?

962
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Thank you.

963
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You said you were on a date.

964
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't know.

965
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What is an update?

966
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm getting used to it.

967
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm 63 years old.

968
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm almost complete.

969
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm not used to it.

970
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm out.

971
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm out.

972
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm not good at it.

973
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm not good at it.

974
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm not good at it.

975
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:55,000
People die.

976
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Good morning.

977
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Good morning.

978
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm Ritsu Hayata, a teacher.

979
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I'm a teacher in English and Chinese.

980
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Thank you.

981
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:22,160
I'm a teacher in Kamakura City, Kanko Water

982
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,000
Nagakura?

983
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yes, Nagakura.

984
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Kura?

985
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yes?

986
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Please take this.

987
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Sometimes my heart hurts.

988
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I thought it would be better to have a place to go to this age.

989
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I thought it would be wonderful to be here.

990
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I see.

991
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Please take this.

992
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Excuse me.

993
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Please put it in the box.

994
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yes.

995
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm an adult.

996
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm kind.

997
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm an intelligent teacher.

998
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I might be able to change my mind.

999
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm not kidding.

1000
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Chiyaki Yoshino.

1001
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yes?

1002
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Please take this.

1003
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm Naruse.

1004
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm Naruse.

1005
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I've been suffering from my heart for a week.

1006
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Please listen to the sound.

1007
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm nervous.

1008
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm sorry.

1009
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I'm a little nervous because I'm running at full speed.

1010
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm sorry.

1011
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's okay.

1012
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Please take this.

1013
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Konya

1014
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Will it be good for dancing tonight?

1015
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
All prayers and rough days will be gonna pitiful.

1016
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Tonight, I'll be a mania to dance

1017
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
If I don't give up

1018
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Tonight, I'll be a mania to dance

1019
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Even if I can't understand

1020
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Even if I'm far away

1021
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Tonight, I'll be a mania to dance

1022
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Even if I can't hold anything

1023
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Even if I lose everything

1024
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Tonight, I'll be a mania to dance

1025
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
If the lyrics and the logo come, it's like this

1026
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I feel something

1027
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm a little bit dizzy

1028
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm a little dizzy too

1029
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yes?

1030
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I wonder if I'll make a masterpiece

1031
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I think it's going to be a wonderful thing tomorrow than today

1032
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Everything goes well

1033
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I didn't know it wasn't going to happen

1034
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So I'm walking

1035
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't think it's going to hurt
