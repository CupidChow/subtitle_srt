1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Looking back at you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is the look of a broken sword

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Looking back at him

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life, the river of hope

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mu Jin, thank you for bringing me water today.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are your feet better?

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I made some lamb bone soup for you.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you want to drink it?

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mu Jin

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm coming in.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mu Jin

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mu Jin

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mu Jin, what's wrong?

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mu Jin, what's wrong?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wake up

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, no

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's so hot

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't do it

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right, wine

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you have wine?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wine

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Be careful

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can you do it?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As long as it's warm, it should be fine.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll go find Wuyi

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll get some more wine

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You must be fine

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't die

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why are you here?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're awake

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why did you take all my clothes off?

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's hot

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Lie down

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you keep getting hot, you'll die

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What did you say?

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not dead

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm not dead

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not dead

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not dead

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not dead

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not dead

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not dead

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not dead

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not dead

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not dead

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How can you say I'm dead?

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You stepped on the nail of the embroidery to help me

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What if you die?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My mother was like this before

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Stepped on the nail of the embroidery

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's been a few days

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When I found this way

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's too late

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So thank God you're alive

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Mimi

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't be sad

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't die so easily

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The man on our grassland

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's not that easy to die

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just your face now

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No convincing power

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What kind of man are you pretending?

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't pretend

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I was a big man

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're alive

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're dead

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then you

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Took care of me all night

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Otherwise?

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You lie down first

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A little cold

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why are you laughing?

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's itchy

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Itch

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's itchy

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The north west is on the left

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Farther and farther from Luoyang

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The princess will not die

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
In the middle is Jizhou

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The right is the direction of Cangzhou

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Princess

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If you leave Yunzhou

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where will I go?

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is what you asked for

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I hope he can tell me where you are

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Front Jizhou

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Reverse Cangzhou

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sun

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Didn't I ask you to rest well?

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why did you come here just now?

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm fine

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Aren't we almost out of supplies?

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want to take Mimi to encourage

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go shopping together

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Go

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Still suspect her

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you have to stay by her side

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
To be assured

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, no, no

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I didn't mean that

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Just

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think this little girl

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Quite smart

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Take her

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Can eat less loss

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I want to thank her

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That day

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Took care of me

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
OK

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OK

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look at your little sheep

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Looks like you

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So white

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mimi

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Wait

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This mother is here again

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong?

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I actually want to ask you

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you willing to go with me

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
To Yunzhou to buy supplies?

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't think too much

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's just that women talk about prices

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's more convenient than men

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Although Yunzhou is not like Chang'an

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But it's also very lively

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You must have never seen it

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll go to Li Junshi

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Say something

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You go

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
it is good

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then I'll go first

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Changge

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you embroidering?

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is too ugly

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I only know how to embroider this kind

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you don't like it

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Just don't wear it

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, no, no

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I like it

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who said I don't like it

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You continue

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This wallet

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It looks a little ugly

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's pretty good

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's wrong with you

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Are you okay?

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's okay

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I didn't mean it just now

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who said this ugly

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Who is not blind

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You said it just now

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think as long as you embroider

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
All look good

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Changge, that's it

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You tell me

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What's so fun about your Central Plains?

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What's so fun about the Central Plains?

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or what's delicious

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Or you tell me

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll buy you whatever you want

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you have money?

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can borrow from Mu Jin

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't wait

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do his slave for a few days

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Just be a debtor

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't want you to save other people's slaves

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Changge

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you like rabbits?

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I used to like them

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What about now?

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I've done it

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Here

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is for me?

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm a military counselor

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I have some anger

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can buy whatever you want

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't worry about me

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's been a long time

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're so nice to me

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you Changge

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll buy you whatever you want

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When you arrive in Yunzhou

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It should be the Mid-Autumn Festival

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In our place, Mid-Autumn Festival

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We have to eat a band

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
With family

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And play the Kongming lantern

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's no band in the grassland

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can try it when you arrive in Yunzhou

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you miss home?

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't worry

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll buy you a lot of bands

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And come back to you

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Stop

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,600
You are not

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a finished product

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It will be happy to send it to the shop that has the materials

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh no!

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The shop's manager is here to tell us

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They have been keeping the stock for the rainy season

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We don't need the cloths anymore

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We can say it's good but they still want to return it

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Luckily they didn't take back the deposit

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What should we do?

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What should we do?

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What should we do?

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What's the use of the deposit?

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It seems that we have to take back the stock

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Madam, I have an idea

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We can sell the cloths in the market

233
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's a good idea

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's a good idea

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay, let's listen to Yan

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sell the cloths in the market

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Pack up and sell the cloths

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hurry

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Take care

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This shop is good

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, we will come again

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Xia'er

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Xia'er

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Come

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
How long will it take to get to Cangzhou?

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sir, it's not far

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It will take us a day or two to get there

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's really fated

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What's wrong? Are you sick?

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have a little cold

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You have to take care of yourself

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You didn't find the princess

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can put yourself in

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Compared with the safety of Luiyan

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's nothing

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't worry

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can handle it

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's put the princess aside

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
His Majesty has ordered

265
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to summon you back to Chang'an

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and make you the imperial censor

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How do you know?

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I am in contact with Chang'an

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Stop it

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't you want to protest?

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Luiyan is still alive

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
How can I leave?

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I hope I can make up for my mistakes

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I am not afraid to take responsibility

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I must find Luiyan back

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Look at your current condition

279
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If you don't get treated in time

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm afraid you can't see the princess in the future

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Not to mention sharing his worries for his Majesty

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can take care of yourself

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can go back to help

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But, brother

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Luiyan is like my sister

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Please don't

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will try my best

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Master

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Do you think this handkerchief

290
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
can be sold at a good price in Cangzhou?

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yunzhou is good at handcraft

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The maids are all over the city

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But Cangzhou

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Look

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The delicate handwork and direction

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
are all in the hand

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's a good deal

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
it's a good deal

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
it's a good deal

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a good deal

303
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a good deal

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's a good deal

305
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's a good deal

306
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's a good deal

307
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The direction of handcraft

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
is like from the nobility

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If we take this to Cangzhou

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
those nobles

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
will be like a gem

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Look

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is the rabbit I embroidered

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The rabbits others embroidered

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
are all red eyes

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The rabbit I embroidered

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is green eyes

318
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Because the rabbit's eyes are grass

319
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's a piece of freedom

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the lady embroidering this

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
must be a person who has seen the world

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you doing?

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Where did you get this handkerchief?

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You want to do business?

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm not interested in business

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll ask again

328
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Where did you get this handkerchief?

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I've been doing business for decades

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm really not afraid of danger

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But I tell you

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We businessmen

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
only take profits

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Lord

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Master

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
A lady made it

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
in Yunzhou's western cellar

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Princess

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're still in Yunzhou?

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was careless

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What's going on?

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a reunion day

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I want to tell you

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
a sad thing

347
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What sad thing?

348
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Actually it's not a sad thing

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's a good thing

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The border is in chaos

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The court

352
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
sent a notice of the family

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
saying that the people of the border

354
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
who want to go back to the Central Plains

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
can go south with them

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Then

357
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
they will re-register the border

358
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I heard

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
they will be divided into land

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Really?

361
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then can I go home?

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a fate

363
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Before we leave

364
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
let's take action together

365
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and sell all the cloths of Lady Chen

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay

367
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We must

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Anyway

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The western cellar is always

370
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the home of everyone

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We will always be here

372
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay

373
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Go and sell the cloths

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you want to sell less

375
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
no one can leave

376
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let's go

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Xiao Yan

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Xiao Yan

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You can stay

381
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's not a home anyway

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
As long as I have food

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I won't be hungry

384
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Thank you, madam

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Madam

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm afraid that the team going south

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
where are they going?

388
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There are many places

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to go south

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Will they go to Luoyang?

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What?

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You want to go to Luoyang?

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I have a family

394
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in Luoyang

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Madam

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Today

397
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
let me go with them

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
to sell cloths

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I want to do my best

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
to repay you

401
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Aren't you afraid that the government will arrest you?

402
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think it should be okay

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Madam

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
said that no one is asking

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
outside

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Okay

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's go to sell cloths with them

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's good to practice more

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Come

410
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Go

411
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Thank you, mother

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Thank you

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Come

414
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Go

415
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Go

416
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Xiao Yan

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Xiao Yan

418
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Come here

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Come here

420
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I told you

422
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You will like this place

423
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's beautiful

426
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
How to sell this?

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's beautiful

428
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hurry up

429
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Coming

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Is it delicious?

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Delicious

432
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
How is it?

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Are you happy?

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Should we go to the market?

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why are you in a hurry?

436
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is the first time

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I have seen so many people

438
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and so many goods

439
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And everyone is very happy

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival

441
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's more lively

442
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mid-Autumn Festival

443
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Mid-Autumn Festival

444
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
is also called the moon festival

445
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
At this time

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
people from Central Plains

447
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
will gather together to enjoy the moon

448
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And

449
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Eat a band

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How do you know?

451
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You think you are the only one

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
in the world who knows the original score?

453
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mimi

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Mimi

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Did I say something wrong?

456
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You didn't

457
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So Mid-Autumn Festival

458
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
is a festival

459
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
that all people in the family spend together

460
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Actually it's not interesting

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's just a family watching the moon

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Nothing to care about

463
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Look there

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Go

465
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Ice candy

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is not good

467
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Mimi, look

468
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's suitable for you

469
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you talking about?

470
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think this color

471
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is more suitable for Su Yili

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This one?

473
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This color is special

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This one is more suitable for Su Yishe

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's go

476
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Mimi

477
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Look

478
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Do you like this color?

479
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Unfortunately, the embroidered ones are sold out

480
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If there are embroidered ones

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You will look good on it

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I took it out

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This one is really good

484
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Today is the festival

485
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll give it to you

486
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival

487
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If you like it

488
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can pick some more

489
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and bring it back to your family

490
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Your family will be happy

491
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No need

492
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
My lady

493
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Did I say something wrong?

494
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You don't have to bother me

495
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't want to buy

496
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
My lady

497
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I didn't want you to buy cloth

498
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I just talked about my family

499
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
My lady

500
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Mimi

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mimi

502
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Let me see this

503
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Look

504
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That lady just now

505
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
She didn't say anything

506
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't take it to heart

507
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Stop talking

508
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well

509
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was in a bad mood just now

510
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You don't have to say sorry

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You can be happy

513
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's go

514
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Go for a walk

515
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Do you want to eat this?

516
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Two bags

517
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Come and have a look

518
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'll take that one

519
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Take it

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000

Music troupe

522
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This looks delicious

523
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Or I'll buy one for you

524
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Just take it as my apology

525
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay

526
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll take it

527
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Music troupe

528
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Music troupe

529
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Hello

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
How much is this?

531
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Three coins and five coins

532
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's the same

533
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Okay

534
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I just made it

535
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What's wrong?

536
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Is Changge's purse with you?

537
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Music troupe

538
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
No

539
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's not

540
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh no

541
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I think I lost Changge's purse

542
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You lost it with money

543
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I have something here

544
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's not about money

545
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's Changge's purse

546
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's just a purse

547
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll buy ten for her

548
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
She won't think about it

549
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No

550
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I can't lose Changge's purse

551
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I have to find it back

552
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll go now

553
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000

Music troupe

555
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Where are you going?

556
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Don't worry

557
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Think about it

558
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Which stores did you go to just now?

559
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Most of them are in other people's stores

560
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yes

561
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't worry, I'll help you find it

562
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You can find it in this market

563
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll go to the previous stores later

564
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Wait, I'll meet you here later

565
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay, go now

566
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The stores just now

567
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
161

568
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000

163

570
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Now I can finally repay the lady

571
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm sorry

572
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I've hurt her

573
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm really sorry

574
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
about that lady

575
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
She was hurt by me

576
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
If I meet her again

577
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll make up for it

578
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't move

579
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're back

580
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm going to come back

581
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I know you must like this cloth

582
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'll give you this

583
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
as a apology

584
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What?

585
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You gave me a cloth

586
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and that's it?

587
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What do you want?

588
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I want my purse back

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Give it back

590
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This is my purse

591
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
How could it be yours?

592
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What a coincidence

593
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The purse I dropped

594
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
is exactly the same as mine

595
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Even the rabbit on it

596
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
looks ugly

597
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Give it back

598
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You must have mistaken me

599
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
for the rabbit

600
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
This is really my purse

601
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This woman

602
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
stole my purse

603
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and she still doesn't admit it?

604
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Give it back

605
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What are you doing?

606
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I said this is my purse

607
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Why are you so unreasonable?

608
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I

609
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm not unreasonable

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I was just talking to you

611
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
with good words

612
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but you didn't give it back to me

613
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Give it back

614
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
or I'll kill you

615
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Unreasonable

616
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay

617
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You're reasonable

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Tell me

619
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This purse is yours

620
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Do you have any proof?

621
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This purse

622
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
is worth 163 yuan

623
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I just sold the cloth

624
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and earned it one by one

625
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This purse is in your hands now

626
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
How much is in it

627
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is up to you

628
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay

629
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Tell me this is yours

630
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Do you have any proof?

631
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This rabbit

632
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The rabbit on it

633
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is just a ugly white jade

634
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and the needle

635
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is also a mark of re-sewing

636
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The most important thing is

637
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that the purse

638
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
is embroidered with a

639
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
wavy rabbit

640
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
How did you know?

641
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
This is mine

642
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The purse

643
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Look

644
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Am I right?

645
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
This woman

646
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
stole something

647
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and lied to me that it was hers

648
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
She's a liar

649
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Let me tell you

650
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I won't take

651
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
a single penny

652
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
If I didn't rush you today

653
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I would never let you go

654
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You thief

655
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Stop

656
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What's wrong?

657
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Forget it

658
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
If you didn't sell anything

659
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
it's nothing

660
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's your first time

661
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
doing business in time

662
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You must be embarrassed

663
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and want to sell it

664
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If you go back to Luoyang like this

665
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the lady won't deduct your money

666
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's okay

667
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'll go

668
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll go

669
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll go

670
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'll go

671
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'll go

672
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'll go

673
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'll go

674
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'll go

675
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll go

676
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'll go

677
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll go

678
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'll go

679
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You sold so much money

680
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Leyan

681
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You're amazing

682
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I underestimated you

683
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Leyan

684
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You really want to go back to Luoyang

685
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Give me your hand

686
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Take this money

687
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You'll spend a lot of money

688
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Don't tell them

689
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Later

690
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll give you another pay

691
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This is a reward

692
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
for you

693
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We're destined to meet

694
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But on the way

695
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
it's not as windy

696
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
as in Yunzhou

697
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Can you stand it?

698
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I've never

699
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
gone out alone

700
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You kicked me out

701
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't know

702
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
how long I can find a home

703
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Now I'm with you

704
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I've learned so much

705
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
from you and all the ladies

706
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Now I can go to the market

707
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and sell cloth

708
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I think

709
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I should be able to

710
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
find a way to go home

711
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I won't forget you

712
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Okay, okay

713
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Mimi

714
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I found it

715
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Why are you so careless?

716
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's in the store

717
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
before

718
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Look, is there anything missing?

719
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This

720
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, no

721
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This is the one Changge sewed

722
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That woman just now

723
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What woman?

724
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
She is

725
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Mimi, where are you going?

726
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're going to the market

727
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The market is closing

728
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I've spent a lot of money

729
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll give you

730
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
all the money

731
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Since you've decided to leave

732
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
you can leave easily

733
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Anyway

734
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you should be safe

735
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
There are some cakes

736
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
in the kitchen

737
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You can eat them on the way

738
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If you want to eat something hot

739
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
after leaving Yunzhou

740
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it's hard

741
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Come

742
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What I'm most worried about is you

743
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You came here for a short time

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and only learned some tricks

745
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
At least

746
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
you have a good body

747
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
On the way

748
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
you must be diligent

749
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
so that you won't starve to death

750
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Why are you crying?

751
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Everyone has their own fate

752
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm still here

753
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
working in the kitchen

754
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You must

755
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
live a good life

756
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Maybe one day

757
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
you'll see each other again

758
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
All right

759
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Go pack up

760
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Before the gate is closed

761
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
you should leave earlier

762
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Go pack up

763
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Go

764
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Mimi

765
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's getting dark

766
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Who are you looking for?

767
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, no

768
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He's gone

769
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The one who sells cloth

770
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This box is really his

771
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I grabbed it just now

772
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Look

773
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Although these two boxes

774
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
look exactly the same

775
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
one is new

776
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and one has been used for a while

777
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Maybe

778
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
they are all made by Changge

779
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's just that the time of sewing is different

780
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's exactly the same

781
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
How can it be such a coincidence?

782
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't know either

783
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm afraid that only Changge

784
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
knows the truth now

785
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Let's go back and ask him

786
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay

787
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I've told you many times

788
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that I'm doing this

789
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
so that you can learn the craft

790
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Don't take it to heart

791
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Wait a minute

792
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You must follow them

793
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's getting cold

794
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You should wear more clothes

795
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Don't catch a cold

796
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Are you really not

797
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
going with us?

798
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
My ancestors

799
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
are all in Yunzhou

800
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This is my home

801
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Thanks to your care

802
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
for many days

803
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I can't give you anything now

804
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll embroider a box

805
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and give it to you

806
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
as a souvenir

807
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Let's go

808
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Let's go

809
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Don't panic

810
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
or be afraid

811
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
If you're in trouble

812
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
we'll beg for help

813
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If there's danger

814
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
we'll hide

815
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I believe

816
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
you can protect yourself

817
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
By the way

818
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I've put a lot of cakes

819
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
in your bag

820
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's enough for you to eat for a while

821
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Don't let them see it

822
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Let's go

823
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The door is locked

824
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Let's go

825
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Take care, my lady

826
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Get up

827
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Be careful on the road

828
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'll go

829
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'll go

830
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Be careful

831
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Be careful

832
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Are we going out?

833
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go

834
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We'll be back tomorrow

835
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's go

836
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's my fault

837
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I lost the bag

838
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and got late

839
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I can't go back

840
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
to Eagle Division tonight

841
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's nothing

842
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I used to stay in the room

843
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
for a night or two

844
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
No one would worry about me

845
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
What about today?

846
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'll go

847
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll go

848
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'll go

849
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'll go

850
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll go

851
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll go

852
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What about tonight?

853
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Let's go

854
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll take you to the hotel

855
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Wait for me

856
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I've asked Mu Jing

857
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
to buy

858
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the fabrics and herbs

859
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What's wrong?

860
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Today is August 15th

861
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes

862
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's about to winter

863
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
August 15th

864
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
is the Mid-Autumn Festival in your place, right?

865
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I heard that in the Central Plains

866
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
every Mid-Autumn Festival

867
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
people would turn off the lights and enjoy the moon

868
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and eat the band

869
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I wonder if Su Yili

870
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
would do it

871
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'll ask her to try it later

872
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Don't bother

873
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The meaning of Mid-Autumn Festival is not these

874
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Family is here

875
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Family is here

876
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's the Mid-Autumn Festival

877
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
If Sun Tegin

878
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
has no other orders

879
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll go back

880
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Wait

881
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I have something for you

882
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Why does this stone shine?

883
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Look at its light

884
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Does it look like

885
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
the firefly we saw that night?

886
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Why did you give me this?

887
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I just want to tell you

888
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that you can keep the beautiful things

889
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
as long as you pursue them with your heart

890
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Just like

891
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the firefly

892
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I gave you

893
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'll give you

894
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Just like

895
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
family is home

896
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and the place in Xin'an is also home

897
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
In the grasslands

898
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
there is also a happy reunion

899
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
In fact, whether it's the grasslands

900
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
or the Central Plains

901
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I hope we can all be together

902
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and live a long life

903
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
From now on

904
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
no more war will happen

905
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'll go back

906
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you for the gift

907
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'll go back

908
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Mimi

909
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What are you doing?

910
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm here

911
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
watching them celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival

912
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Just now

913
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
a boy was holding a bunch of bands

914
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and was with his family

915
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
They were so happy

916
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Try it

917
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Where did you buy it?

918
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
When I was looking for the bag for you

919
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the stall that sells the bands

920
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
hasn't been closed yet

921
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I saw you didn't come back

922
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
so I bought one

923
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Try it, it's still warm

924
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's been left for so long

925
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
How could it be still warm?

926
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I've been wearing it in my arms

927
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's even warmer than my body temperature

928
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Is it good?

929
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes, it's good

930
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Why don't you try it?

931
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Don't break it

932
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The band is a band

933
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If you break it, you won't be reunited

934
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Really?

935
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Absolutely

936
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This is the custom here

937
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Then

938
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'll try it

939
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It tastes average

940
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and a little bit different

941
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Anyway

942
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I think it's pretty good

943
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
How about I have another bite?

944
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I didn't taste it just now

945
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
How is it?

946
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's pretty good

947
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Eat

948
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Mimi

949
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Do you miss home?

950
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
No

951
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You can tell me about your past

952
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I promise I won't tell anyone

953
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I was taken as a slave

954
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
when I was a child

955
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So

956
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I can't remember

957
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the things happened in my hometown

958
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
What a coincidence

959
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm a slave too

960
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You?

961
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I was born in a slave farm

962
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I've never been to my hometown

963
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Then how did you...

964
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
How did I become the military counselor of Eagle Division?

965
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I was admired by thousands of people

966
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and I was praised by hundreds of people

967
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You're so silly

968
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Actually, it's all because of Sun

969
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I almost got killed when I was a child

970
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Sun saved me

971
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Then he was promoted to a warrior by Great Khan

972
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
He went to Eagle Division and took me with him

973
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Then Eagle Division became my home

974
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Mimi

975
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Actually, Eagle Division is a good place

976
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Look at Li Changge

977
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He's doing well

978
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I hope one day

979
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Eagle Division can become your home

980
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's late

981
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You should go back and have a rest

982
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Then you should go back and have a rest

983
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You have to leave early tomorrow

984
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You have to go back and have a rest

985
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Changge

986
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Where did you get this?

987
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I took it from you

988
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yesterday, I lost the pouch you gave me

989
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Then I met a lady

990
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The pouch on her body is exactly the same as yours

991
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I thought she stole it

992
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So I...

993
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But Changge

994
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I saw you embroider this pouch

995
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
How could she have the same pouch as yours?

996
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I used to embroider one for my friend

997
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm sorry

998
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm sorry

999
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm sorry

1000
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I used to embroider one for my friend

1001
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Mimi

1002
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
What does that lady look like?

1003
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
She's not very tall

1004
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But she looks pretty elegant

1005
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But she's not very bold

1006
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I haven't said anything serious

1007
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
She doesn't dare to say anything

1008
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's really Leyan

1009
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Why is Leyan in the clouds?

1010
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Leyan?

1011
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
She's my best friend

1012
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Mimi

1013
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Where did you see her?

1014
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
In the market in Yunzhou

1015
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
There's a bamboo basket on her foot

1016
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
She was selling fabric in the market

1017
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Something must have happened

1018
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Why is Leyan in the clouds?

1019
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
She's a person who doesn't touch the spring water

1020
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
She's doing business

1021
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
No

1022
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I have to go find her

1023
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Mimi

1024
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Thank you

1025
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Changge, where are you going?

1026
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
To Yunzhou

1027
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll go with you

1028
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Go

1029
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Great Khan decides to take action now

1030
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Be quiet

1031
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's so sudden

1032
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Great Khan is planning this

1033
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Sun Dexing

1034
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
The military counselor asked me to inform you

1035
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
He has something to do

1036
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Go to Yunzhou

1037
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He's not telling you

1038
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't care about him

1039
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Mimi

1040
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Don't tell him about my expedition

1041
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm sorry

1042
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm sorry

1043
