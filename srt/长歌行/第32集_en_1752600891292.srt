1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will ride on the river of life and never forget the crazy

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Princess

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Get out of here

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You followed me

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did you lie to me from the beginning?

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Use me

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I just followed the order

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You lied to me

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Use me

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
To lure my best friend to catch him

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
As your trophy

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Give it to minister Du

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
With this family official's prejudice

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it true?

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If there is anything wrong with princess

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You haven't answered me yet

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The prince is missing and is in a bad state

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I brought Changge into Ziwei Palace

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If the prince is really related to Changge

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you want to punish me together?

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I am sorry

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I used to think you were cold-blooded

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was afraid of you

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Later I thought you were just cold-blooded

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You were a good person

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But now

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I think you are a person who has no feelings

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No thoughts

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No heart to be engrossed

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hao Du

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can't you see?

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Changge has been running away from Chang'an

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When did he do anything that hurt the country?

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And hurt Tang?

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In Youzhou

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Changge used Li Yuan and Wang Junkuo

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He almost died in the battle

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In Shuozhou

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He was willing to be captured for the sake of the people

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He is already dead once

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Isn't that enough?

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is the order you gave me

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Really that important?

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hao Du

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hao Du

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
People don't live for wealth

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Not for credit

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But for what they think is worth living

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I also understand too late

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So I lost Changge

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I hope you can be happy

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yuan Niangzi

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's wrong?

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Not happy?

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Didn't you have a good time with Sun?

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Look who's here

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Little Master

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sister is your brother

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yuan Niang, come

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are so tall

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't hold you

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Where is Qin?

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll go find him

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ok

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Be careful

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Qin

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Qin

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Qin

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Little Master

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are finally back

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You have been in a hurry without these days

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And Qin

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Everyone is looking for you

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sorry everyone

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sorry to make you worry

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Shiba

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Shiba

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you for taking Sun away for me that day

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's my duty

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I don't want to have another one

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Little Master

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Qin

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Good

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are back safely

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I finally let go of the big stone in my heart

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sorry to make you worry

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Not at all

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are safe and sound

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am happy to hear that

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Little Master

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's your plan for the future?

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't even know

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can still live

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But the people who came down from Chang'an

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Have already arrived in Luoyang

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm afraid I can't stay here for a few days

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Take me back to the grassland

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They have already found you

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The best way now

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is to leave Tang

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Go to a place they don't know

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let me think about it

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Changge

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You still owe me three things

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You have to break your promise

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I thought when I died

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You and I were already clear

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Clear

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You said you

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You want to be clear with me

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Our business

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll talk about it later

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Leaving Luoyang

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is the most important thing now

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As for where to go in the future

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Can be discussed after leaving the city

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you have a decision

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Just tell me

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The entire Yanxing Sect

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Will listen to your arrangement

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I was hit by the princess

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I forgot my mission

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I dare not

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Dare not

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
One day without catching Li Changge

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The crown prince is in danger

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just don't understand

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why did you decide

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The prince disappeared because of Li Changge

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You are suspecting me of my judgment

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I dare not

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This is what I saw with my own eyes

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
In Shuozhou

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Li Changge was humiliated by the people

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If he wants to hurt Tang

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He will be punished

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Shut up

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is your first time

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ask me questions

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have no other meaning

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will catch Li Changge again

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
To explain to you

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No need

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Since your heart is already shaken

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You don't have to worry about Li Changge

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Godfather

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your body has not fully recovered

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't need you to worry

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You stay in the house and think about it

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Think about yourself

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
About your identity

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Did you lie to me from the beginning

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Use me

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I used to think you were cold-blooded

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was afraid of you

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Later I thought you were just a good person

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But now

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think you are a heartless

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No thoughts

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No new ideas

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I will go

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Are you ready

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If Li Changge is there

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't hurt her life

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The crown prince wants to see you

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I too

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
don't know

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
EL FAN

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Come on.

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,000
I guess this is the Temple Master.

185
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
Yes, I am.

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
I am from Zhongzhou.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,160
I've been married for a long time.

188
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
I heard that Zili was in trouble.

189
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,480
I've been thinking about him.

190
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,480
I went back to visit my family.

191
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,360
I heard that Liuyun Temple has been doing well.

192
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,840
I've been saving the refugees.

193
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,680
So I came to offer incense

194
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
and offer my respects to the people.

195
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
You are thoughtful.

196
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,280
Please.

197
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,160
Aching F됬

198
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,320
Please.

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
What are you doing standing here?

200
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
You told me to tell you about us later.

201
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
It's been a night.

202
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,920
Can I tell you now?

203
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,400
Well.

204
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
You go first.

205
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,800
Li Changge.

206
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,080
I don't want to have an affair with you.

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,440
I don't want to have an affair with you.

208
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,320
I want to be with you.

209
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,360
What?

210
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,800
I want you to take back what you said.

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,520
Now you're alive and I'm alive.

212
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,480
There's no love between us.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,520
How can I take back what I said?

214
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,600
The deal is between us.

215
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,680
I've never agreed to love.

216
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,960
What you said

217
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
doesn't count.

218
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Why are you so stubborn?

219
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,920
You're unreasonable.

220
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm not unreasonable with you.

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,720
Anyway,

222
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
I remember what you owe me.

223
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,560
And I'll never repay you.

224
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,800
So,

225
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
don't you ever say sorry to me.

226
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,120
Okay.

227
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,760
I promise you.

228
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,160
Who changes his mind? Who is a puppy?

229
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,320
Who changes his mind? Who is a puppy?

230
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,400
Can you let me go now?

231
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,760
Where are you going?

232
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,120
To the Holy-gathering Temple.

233
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
I have to say goodbye to the temple owner.

234
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
I have a lot of things to do.

235
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,480
I can't just leave.

236
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,400
I have to finish what I have to do

237
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,400
and be a good brother.

238
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll go with you.

239
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,720
There are women in the temple.

240
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
It's inconvenient for you to go.

241
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm going to ask for a favor.

242
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,720
It's fast.

243
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,720
Then I'll send you to the gate.

244
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll go with you.

245
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
I'll go with you.

246
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,760
I'll go with you.

247
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll go with you.

248
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I'll go with you.

249
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
I'll go with you.

250
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
I'll go with you.

251
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I'll go with you.

252
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,040
Okay. I won't go in.

253
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
When did you become a dog?

254
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,240
I don't want to be without you anymore.

255
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,280
That feeling.

256
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
I'm in a hurry.

257
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
I'll pick you up at the gate.

258
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
Do you really think I'm a little monkey?

259
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's make a deal.

260
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,840
I'll pick you up.

261
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,520
Okay.

262
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,960
Y Verfتر

263
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,760
Lighten the fire you're still out of

264
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:08,600
light the poi

265
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
master

266
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,200
I was just at the door.

267
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,800
Let me see.

268
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,920
Take your time.

269
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
A group of people came to the door.

270
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,680
I don't know what they are doing.

271
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,120
They don't look like they are here to see a doctor.

272
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,600
It's that Minister Du...

273
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,240
Is A'Li back?

274
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm afraid that

275
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,120
Liu Yun Guan and A'Li's fate will be over.

276
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,800
Forget it.

277
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,080
Now,

278
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
I just hope that she can leave for good.

279
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Don't come back and commit suicide.

280
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,560
What does it have to do with A'Li?

281
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,960
Yes.

282
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Sorry.

283
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,440
Endeared by the God of Scourge.

284
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,520
Minister Du.

285
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,440
Is your health getting better?

286
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,520
Thank you for your concern and concern.

287
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,800
I said it's not easy to recover.

288
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm here today

289
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
to ask you

290
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,400
to help me.

291
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,360
What a coincidence.

292
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,000
You just got out of the hospital

293
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,320
and went to treat your illness

294
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,760
with Situ Langlang.

295
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,960
When will you come back?

296
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
It's not known yet.

297
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,080
Then,

298
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,760
can you

299
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
help me

300
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,520
to check on Jingdan?

301
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
A doctor's heart is a person's heart.

302
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
Please, Minister Du.

303
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Please.

304
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,680
You guys

305
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,000
wait outside.

306
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes.

307
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Please, Minister Du.

308
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,600
Please.

309
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,160
Ooh.

310
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,200
Your pulse...

311
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
How is it?

312
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,280
It has sparse vision and weak sulfate.

313
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
It seems that you

314
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,360
have been getting less bardzo recently

315
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,600
and the heart is SECET.

316
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
Too bad

317
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,280
the disaster k?",

318
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,240
such a disaster

319
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,720
can.

320
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,400
It's not a disaster.

321
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,320
Butelf

322
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,600
But the people...

323
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
Have you heard

324
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,120
about the water in Ziwei Palace?

325
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,920
I have heard about it.

326
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,720
The palace is on fire.

327
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
The Crown Prince is missing.

328
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
Do you know

329
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,000
the situation is serious?

330
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,160
Minister Du,

331
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,400
is Liuyun Temple...

332
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
related to Liuyun Temple?

333
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
You know it well.

334
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,480
Liuyun Temple is an outskirts place.

335
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,360
You don't need to ask the court.

336
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,200
You just need to do good deeds.

337
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,840
You'd better have evidence.

338
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,280
Don't move.

339
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,160
Be careful.

340
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:03,960
Yes.

341
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,840
Evidence?

342
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,880
What you said is right.

343
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,680
The person who set the fire

344
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,600
is indeed in the temple.

345
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,200
You are...

346
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,120
Don't you want to see me?

347
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,040
Why is it so quiet today?

348
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,120
I...

349
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,920
Brother Li, did you make a mistake?

350
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,720
I don't remember

351
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,040
you did this twice.

352
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
You really don't let people

353
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
take advantage of you.

354
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,040
Brother Li's chess is rough.

355
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
If it's not fair,

356
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know

357
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,760
how long it will last.

358
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm playing chess.

359
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Don't talk about others.

360
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,480
Then,

361
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,880
be careful.

362
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,560
You are a strong man.

363
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,120
You'd better stop struggling.

364
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,600
You...

365
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,480
You seem to be serious.

366
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,600
But you are actually a thief.

367
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,760
But don't be too happy.

368
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,560
It's not certain who will win.

369
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,000
I won't.

370
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:39,760
Don't move.

371
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I advise you not to do it.

372
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Otherwise, these poor beggars

373
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
will really go to the hell to report.

374
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Ziwei Palace is where you set fire.

375
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Who are you?

376
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
You don't need to know that.

377
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Anyway,

378
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
it's right to come to take your life.

379
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Did you kidnap the Crown Prince?

380
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
He is dead.

381
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Liar.

382
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
What is he going to do?

383
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
How dare you kill the Crown Prince?

384
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm your master's sworn enemy.

385
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
If I don't kill the Crown Prince,

386
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
who should I kill?

387
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
You are from Ashile Tribe.

388
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Now the Crown Prince is in danger.

389
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
You are not good at protecting the throne.

390
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
How can you explain to the common people?

391
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
Instead of being in prison,

392
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
you'd better confess yourself and get a good reputation.

393
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,880
It's all about the

394
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
unethical affairs.

395
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Thank you, Zhizhen.

396
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,760
If you really killed the Crown Prince,

397
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm afraid you'll have spread the news

398
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
in Luoyang

399
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
and caused a chaos in the city.

400
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
How can you wait until today?

401
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
An outsider

402
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
likes to be nosy.

403
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Qunniu.

404
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Qunniu.

405
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Qunniu.

406
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Qunniu, are you okay?

407
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Qunniu.

408
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
No matter how nosy you are,

409
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
the one who stabs you

410
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
is his heart.

411
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm the one you want.

412
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Don't hurt innocent people.

413
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Of course.

414
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
You can't go out today.

415
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
No one in the world

416
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
knows that

417
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Fang Du and I are good at making decisions.

418
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
It's the common people's double arm.

419
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I'll cut it off today.

420
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
It's not necessary to do this.

421
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Minister Du is really brave.

422
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
But I don't know

423
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
what to do.

424
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
So what?

425
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Minister Du is good at making decisions.

426
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
But he can't move.

427
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
What a pity.

428
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
If you want to do it, do it quickly.

429
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Don't talk nonsense.

430
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
Since you want to die,

431
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I'll show mercy

432
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
and give you a painful death.

433
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Wait.

434
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
But this maid

436
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
looks familiar to me.

437
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
You are

438
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Sher's maid?

439
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Mrs. Jinse is a good memory.

440
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Why are you here?

441
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
I'm here to avenge.

442
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
What revenge?

443
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
I have a old account with this Du Ruhui.

444
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Why don't you leave Mrs. Jinse to me?

445
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Don't let her blood stain your clothes.

446
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I didn't expect

447
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
I'm not the only one who wants Minister Du's life.

448
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Are you related to Minister Du

449
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
because you are in the grassland?

450
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Mrs. Jinse,

451
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
can you give me a favor?

452
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Du Ruhui,

453
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
don't think you can die so quickly.

454
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Interesting.

455
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Be careful with your head.

456
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Don't ruin my big plan.

457
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
You have been pushing me

458
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
into the dead end for years.

459
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Have you ever thought about today?

460
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
I have no regrets.

461
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
You really have a blood debt.

462
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
You have no regrets.

463
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
I don't know

464
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,760
what you two are related to,

465
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
but I still want to advise you.

466
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
I advise you

467
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
not to curse and abuse.

468
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

469
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
You will die.

470
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Li,

471
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
don't curse and abuse

472
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
after thinking about it.

473
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
If I don't kill Du Ruhui,

474
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I will be in trouble.

475
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
I thought you were unconscious

476
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
and still obsessed with it.

477
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
I was wrong.

478
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
I have been living my life,

479
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
but I still can't save you.

480
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Why should I save you?

481
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
I will save you.

482
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
You don't have to say anything.

483
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Please.

484
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Li.

485
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Take them away.

486
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Yes.

487
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
You are a slave.

488
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
You don't know how to live.

489
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
If so,

490
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
let them die together.

491
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
I just left for a few hours.

492
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
You are here.

493
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Thank you, sir.

494
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Dasha,

495
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
if it weren't for Mr. Sun's permission,

496
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
I wouldn't have met such a good man.

497
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Sir, come and help me.

498
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
I...

499
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Did I hear it wrong?

500
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
You are my master?

501
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
It seems that I really need to charge.

502
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Li,

503
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
take Mr. Du and go.

504
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Si Tu and I will hold them back.

505
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Go!

506
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Mr. Du.

507
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Hurry.

508
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Hurry.

509
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Come on.

510
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Be careful, Qian Jiang.

511
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
I'll open the door.

512
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Why can't I open it?

513
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I can't open it.

514
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
It's open.

515
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Go, everyone.

516
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Hurry.

517
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Hurry.

518
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Li Changge.

519
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Go.

520
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Hurry.

521
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,760
What's your purpose?

522
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Don't blame yourself.

523
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
I'll help you.

524
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,760
It's just that the Tang Dynasty can't live without Du Ruhui.

525
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Take Mr. Du away.

526
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Mr. Du, let's go.

527
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Li Changge,

528
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
come out.

529
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Bi, take care of everyone.

530
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I'll go save Master.

531
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Uncle Shang, let's go.

532
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Godfather,

533
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
I'm sorry.

534
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Good job, Du.

535
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
You've improved a lot.

536
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Thank you for your compliment.

537
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Remember,

538
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Du,

539
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,760
don't be arrogant and be self-satisfied at any time.

540
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Your duty is to guard the whole Hongyi Palace

541
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
and serve the King of Qin.

542
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
At critical moments,

543
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,760
you even have to sacrifice your life.

544
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Are you afraid?

545
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
I'm not afraid.

546
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
I'll always serve the King of Qin

547
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
and serve my father.

548
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Hurry.

549
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Be careful, Master.

550
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Uncle Du.

551
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
It's Godfather.

552
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Something happened to Liuyun Temple.

553
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I want to go there, too.

554
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
But we don't know the situation in Liuyun Temple.

555
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
For safety,

556
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
you'd better stay in Fuyia.

557
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
How can I stay?

558
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
I can't stay here.

559
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
I can't stay here.

560
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
I can't stay here.

561
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I can't stay here.

562
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I can't stay here.

563
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
I can't stay here.

564
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I can't stay here.

565
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
How can I stay?

566
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
I don't know if something happened to Changge.

567
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Let me go.

568
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
OK.

569
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Liuyun,

570
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
you must follow me closely.

571
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
OK.

572
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I have a good book.

573
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Do you want to read it?

574
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
No.

575
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Just read it.

576
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Brother Li, what do you mean?

577
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Aren't you leaving?

578
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
I'll give it to you.

579
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Don't forget me in the future.

580
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
It's not a normal thing.

581
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
It's not a normal thing.

582
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Where did you get it?

583
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
It's my stuff.

584
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
It's not fair.

585
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Brother Li,

586
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
are you...

587
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Li Jingli, Wei Gong?

588
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
What?

589
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Do I look like him?

590
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Mr. Qian.

591
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Sit down.

592
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
If you stand up,

593
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
how can I talk to you?

594
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
How about it?

595
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Do you want to

596
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
borrow this book?

597
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Why not?

598
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Wait.

599
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
You must play the chess with me.

600
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Then I can give you this book.

601
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Gu Sheng.

602
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
This is...

603
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
This Gu Sheng

604
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
is the signal to attack the reinforcements in the city.

605
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
In the southwest direction,

606
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
it's Liuyun Temple.

607
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Liuyun Temple.

608
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Brother Cang.

609
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
This game is not over yet.

610
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
I said it.

611
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
If you leave like this,

612
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
you will never get this book again.

613
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I have to go.

614
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
The book is too heavy.

615
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Thank you, Brother Li.

616
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Thank you for your kindness.

617
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Goodbye.

618
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Stop.

619
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Listen.

620
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
If you don't open your eyes,

621
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I don't mind hitting you.

622
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
You are so fake.

623
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Go.

624
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Please forgive me.

625
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
Please forgive me.

626
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Master.

627
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Master.

628
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
Why are you back?

629
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Why?

630
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Everything happened because of me.

631
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Everything happened because of me.

632
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
You shouldn't bear the responsibility.

633
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Master, take her away.

634
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I'll take care of her.

635
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Sit down, Master.

636
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Wait.

637
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
I'm here today.

638
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Don't be like you wish.

639
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,760
You are too high-minded.

640
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Get on it.

641
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
You are awake.

642
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
You are awake.

643
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Master, our people are gathering.

644
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Master Du, please hold on.

645
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I've sent someone to find Master Sun.

646
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
You will be fine.

647
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm fine.

648
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
How is it going inside?

649
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Master, Li, and Mr. Situ are still inside.

650
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
But don't worry.

651
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Master and Mr. Situ are highly skilled.

652
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Yi Bu.

653
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
Hao Du.

654
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm late.

655
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Hurry.

656
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Go save Li Changge.

657
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Take the people to the back.

658
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
There are masters of Ashile Tribe inside.

659
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Kill them all.

660
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Don't spare any of them.

661
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Yes.

662
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Go.

663
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Go.

664
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Master.

665
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Master.

666
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Master.

667
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Princess.

668
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Why are you here?

669
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
This...

670
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Wei Shuyu.

671
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Take the princess away.

672
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
There are masters of Ashile Tribe inside.

673
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
It's dangerous.

674
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
But...

675
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Where is Li?

676
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
He was injured to save us.

677
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
He is still inside.

678
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Master.

679
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Who are you?

680
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Go to hell.

681
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Madam, kill her.

682
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
It's not the time yet.

683
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
I don't care who you are.

684
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,760
When I go out,

685
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,760
I will make you die a terrible death.

686
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Go.

687
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Ashile Sun.

688
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Why are you here?

689
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Jinse.

690
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
It's you.

691
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
It's you.

692
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
You hit me for a woman.

693
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Have you forgotten your last name?

694
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,760
You betrayed Khan for Li.

695
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Kill her.

696
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Kill them.

697
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Don't spare any of them.

698
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Can you still move?

699
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Yes.

700
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
