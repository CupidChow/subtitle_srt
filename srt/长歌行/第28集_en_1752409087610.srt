The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Episode 16

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,760
Anrong,

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
are you ready for the carriage ride?

5
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Mr. Hao has been waiting outside for a long time.

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Forget it.

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,400
I'll go by myself.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
You stay here and watch.

9
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,680
If you really feel unwell,

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,680
you should invite a group of people here as soon as possible.

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,160
Do you really

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,600
need me to stay with you?

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm sure you don't need to worry

14
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,640
about me.

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,200
You just stay here and take care of the Crown Prince.

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,000
You really trust me.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,600
Don't joke around at this time.

18
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes.

19
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,760
Go.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,360
Go.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,160
Go.

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,560
Don't hurt my brother!

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,400
Mother!

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,200
Don't hurt my brother!

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,040
My brother is still alive!

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,720
Mother!

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,840
Don't hurt my brother!

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Don't hurt my brother!

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,760
Mother!

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,240
Don't hurt my brother!

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Don't hurt him!

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,720
Mother!

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,680
Don't hurt him!

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,760
What are you doing?

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,480
Let him go.

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
I want to save him.

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,840
They want to save my brother.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
My brother is going to die.

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,600
He's getting married.

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,240
My brother!

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,440
Mother!

42
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Stop him!

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,280
Father!

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
Don't hurt him!

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
He's really my father!

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,840
My dear,

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,960
the plague is spreading

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
and it must be destroyed.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
It can't be delayed.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,680
Your Highness.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,640
Mother!

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Mother,

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,920
I know.

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I know you can't trust me now.

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
But your brother is sick.

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,920
He's seriously ill.

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
Don't chase him.

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,720
But he's not in pain now.

59
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
Okay?

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
Last night,

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,760
I gave him and Xiao Qu

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
a sleeping pill.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,640
Suddenly,

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,600
he got high fever

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
and black and white on his body.

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,480
Then,

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
he got cold.

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,920
He got cold.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,760
I rubbed his hands,

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,720
feet and face.

71
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
He's still cold.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
I didn't.

73
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,400
My brother is dead.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,640
Mother,

75
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,400
your brother was born

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,920
without his parents.

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
It's not easy

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,520
to hold him up.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Just take it as a chance to get married.

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Make sure he won't die much.

81
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
And then,

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,600
act as Rushuangки oaf.

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Mother.

84
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
I haven't eaten

85
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,920
white rice noodles

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,240
with you yet.

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,480
How can I

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,640
spend the whole morning

89
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,360
without you!

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,560
When you come to Luoyang,

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,200
I can get you anything you want.

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,040
I want the princess.

93
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,440
Please,

94
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
give me a lot of food.

95
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I don't know.

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Your brother went to reunite with his parents.

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Just let him go.

98
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
In the next life,

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,760
don't be a burden to our family.

100
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
My brother went to see his parents.

101
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm not happy at all.

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't want my brother to see his parents.

103
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
I want to see my parents.

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
I know.

105
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Wuniang.

106
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
You can miss them.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
You can be sad.

108
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
But you have to live well.

109
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
With your brother's hope,

110
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
live well.

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Wuniang.

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Wuniang.

113
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
A'ci.

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Li, you had a nightmare?

115
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
You were calling Sun.

116
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Who is Sun?

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Nothing.

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
You can't lock yourself in the room all day.

119
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,760
You will think too much if you stay alone for too long.

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
You will have dreams if you have something to think about.

121
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
A'Bing.

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Thank you.

123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
For what?

124
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I haven't read any books.

125
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,760
My ex-wife taught me to read.

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,760
My ex-wife taught me to read.

127
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
But my mother always told me that

128
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
people can read well.

129
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
They can eat well.

130
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
They can eat well.

131
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
They can live well.

132
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I think you are right.

133
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Li is so smart.

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
He can do everything.

135
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
What you said just now is smart.

136
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Right?

137
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
You always say I'm smart.

138
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Right.

139
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
You were calling people's names.

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Sun.

141
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
The monkey you raised.

142
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
It's Sun.

143
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Sun.

144
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
It's the bird you raised.

145
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
He is my former partner.

146
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Since he is your partner,

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
why didn't he come to you?

148
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
What kind of partner is he?

149
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
I did something wrong to him.

150
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
He didn't come to me.

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
He hates me.

152
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
He hates me.

153
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
I feel better.

154
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Any news about Changge?

155
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Mr. Qin, I've found out.

156
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
We found a man who is close to the young master.

157
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
He went to Luoyang with a doctor and a young man.

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Who are the doctors and young men?

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Is Changge safe with them?

160
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Don't be so fake.

161
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
We will find the commandant Li.

162
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
You don't have to worry.

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Xu Feng.

164
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Xu Feng is impatient.

165
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
He is very talkative.

166
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
But he is only thinking about the young master.

167
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Don't take it to heart.

168
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Since it's like this,

169
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,760
we will speed up the process tomorrow.

170
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
We will arrive at Luoyang soon.

171
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Since everyone is good for the young master,

172
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
why do you have to make it difficult for him?

173
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
He has been with him for a while.

174
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Did you not see that he was really fake to the young master?

175
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Even if he is true to the young master,

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,760
I will never forget the hatred of Shuozhou.

177
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I understand your feelings.

178
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
But since our goals are now set,

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
we should work together.

180
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Why do we have to be so talkative?

181
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Okay.

182
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Don't think too much.

183
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Brother, have some water.

184
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Go back and have a rest.

185
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
We will leave early tomorrow.

186
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Brother, hug me.

187
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Come.

188
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Brother Anjun, you have to climb higher.

189
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
And...

190
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Stop.

191
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Yuan Niangzi is not sensible.

192
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
You are not sensible either.

193
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
This is dangerous.

194
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
What are you trying to do?

195
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
You scared her.

196
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Yuan Niangzi.

197
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
We don't want to play with this person.

198
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Play with me.

199
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
No.

200
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Yuan Niangzi.

201
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
You can play with anyone in the world.

202
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
But you can't play with this person.

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
He is not Anjun.

204
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
His name is Ashile Sun.

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
He is the one who made your aunt...

206
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Xie Xifeng.

207
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Anjun, it's late.

208
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
You should go to sleep with Yuan Niangzi.

209
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Yuan Niangzi, be good.

210
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Yuan Niangzi, let's go to another place.

211
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
You are too much.

212
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
She said me.

213
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
What's wrong with me?

214
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
What do you think?

215
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
You want to make Yuan Niangzi the second young master.

216
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
And live in the pain of hatred forever?

217
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,760
You saw the pain of the young master.

218
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Don't you know the price of hatred?

219
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Look at Yuan Niangzi.

220
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Look at Yuan Niangzi.

221
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
She was so happy just now.

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
The second young master and his wife...

223
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,760
want their children to grow up without worries.

224
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Instead of suffering from hatred.

225
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Your Highness.

226
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
The materials of South Hill have been recorded.

227
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
Aunt.

228
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
But...

229
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
But I told Yuan Niangzi that...

230
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
that we will do everything in our power...

231
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,400
What's wrong?

232
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200
The Crown Prince went out?

233
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,880
The Crown Prince went to South Hill?

234
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Of course not.

235
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
The Crown Prince went out?

236
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,200
I wonder when

237
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,920
my brother will grow up.

238
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,000
Fine.

239
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,200
Let him go out

240
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
to see the miserable appearance of the people.

241
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,280
Maybe he will be touched.

242
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,760
But he shouldn't make trouble again.

243
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Your Highness,

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,160
you really look like a sister.

245
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,320
Flower umbrella.

246
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Flower umbrella.

247
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Flower umbrella.

248
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,200
Green vegetables.

249
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
Green vegetables from Jinzhai.

250
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,920
Fan.

251
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,600
Look, brother.

252
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Look at the fan.

253
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,920
Dragon dance.

254
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,520
Come on.

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,320
Look at this.

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,720
Sheng Xin,

257
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
since Madam chose you,

258
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
it's all up to you now.

259
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,560
OK.

260
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,160
Come on.

261
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Hurry to come down.

262
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,200
That's great!

263
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,760
Great!

264
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,120
Great!

265
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,920
Come on.

266
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,800
Great!

267
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,440
Great!

268
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,920
Barcelona, come on!

269
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,320
Great!

270
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,080
Come!

271
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,760
Come!

272
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,960
Great!

273
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,640
Come!

274
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,320
Great!

275
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,520
Great!

276
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Come on.

277
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,400
Great!

278
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,800
Great!

279
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,640
Excellent!

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,920
Again, come on!

281
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
Loyalty.

282
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Let've fun.

283
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,520
Where are you going?

284
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Let's have fun.

285
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:15,000
Hurry up.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Great.

287
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,120
Let's run.

288
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Go up.

289
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey.

290
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
Let's go!

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
Don't hurry.

292
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,160
Hurry up.

293
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,200
Go to see how much total you got.

294
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,940
Cut him off!

295
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,600
Was that you?!

296
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,800
Get back here!

297
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,440
Let go!

298
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Come on.

299
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,600
It's my turn.

300
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,800
It hurts!

301
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,440
Don't move.

302
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm applying the medicine.

303
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,040
Don't move.

304
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,920
Don't move.

305
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,120
It hurts.

306
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,800
Does it still hurt?

307
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
Thank you for saving me.

308
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,440
Tell me your name.

309
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
I'll be there soon.

310
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,280
I'll repay you.

311
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,120
You should wait.

312
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Mister!

313
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,800
Mister!

314
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,760
Here.

315
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Come back!

316
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,920
Don't go!

317
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,720
Mister, are you okay?

318
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,480
I told you to come back!

319
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you okay?

320
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,440
Come back!

321
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,080
Come on.

322
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,840
Give me a piece of cake.

323
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,360
Here.

324
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,240
Brother A'Zhun.

325
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,880
Do you like this song?

326
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Steal it!

327
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,320
Set out!

328
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,760
It's not wrong.

329
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,120
I'm not.

330
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,800
I have nothing else to make up for you.

331
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,440
In the future, if you need anything,

332
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,080
blow this.

333
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,800
I'll protect you

334
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,320
and raise you for your parents.

335
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,960
Is that all?

336
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,800
It's fine.

337
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Let's celebrate this.

338
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,200
What am I thinking?

339
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,580
How did the Crown Prince

340
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,520
create such chaos when he first came here?

341
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,440
Crown Prince?

342
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,520
Your Highness,

343
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,160
we brought some silver cash.

344
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:23,560
Comeant hate due to endless

345
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,080
anger was forced to

346
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
kill two Musashi over

347
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,440
a hundred皇achas.

348
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
So he ran out for an tatoo.

349
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,320
And picked a tantrum.

350
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,960
But after all,

351
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,480
he got 小人�手  decline.

352
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Is the Crown Prince coming?

353
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,960
You are

354
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
no match for him in the battlefield.

355
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,560
My apprentice!

356
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,040
See you later.

357
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,080
If you

358
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,960
care about business better than the government,

359
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
why don't you come from the south

360
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
to do something?

361
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,080
Come on.

362
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,080
Your Highness.

363
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,760
Wei Leng Jun,

364
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,200
I finally get to see you.

365
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,720
Those people outside are crazy.

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,920
I want to go back to Chang'an.

367
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
Go prepare the horse and carriage.

368
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,000
I want to go back to Chang'an.

369
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Your Highness is injured.

370
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,960
How did you protect the Crown Prince?

371
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,640
They are just a bunch of rebels.

372
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,240
I was kind enough to give them money.

373
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,480
But the result is like this.

374
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,040
They are all killed.

375
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
It's too horrible.

376
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,400
I want to go back to Chang'an.

377
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,560
I want to go back to Chang'an.

378
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,640
I want to go back to Chang'an.

379
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
I want to go back to Chang'an.

380
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
I want to go back to Chang'an.

381
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
I want to go back to Chang'an.

382
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I want to go back to Chang'an.

383
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,520
What did you do this time?

384
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,320
Sister.

385
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm injured.

386
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,760
Why don't you care about me?

387
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,040
You don't care about me at all.

388
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,800
Let me see.

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,680
Chengqian.

390
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,800
Brother Shuyu.

391
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,920
Come with me.

392
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,240
Let's go.

393
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,720
Your Highness.

394
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,240
I'll go.

395
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Go check on the Crown Prince.

396
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,720
He might be in trouble again.

397
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,720
Fine.

398
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Thank you.

399
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,320
Go.

400
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,000
Move.

401
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,640
Let's go.

402
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,960
Your Highness.

403
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Please spare us.

404
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,680
Your Highness.

405
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,480
Get up.

406
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,880
Please spare us.

407
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,560
Get up.

408
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,440
Don't move.

409
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,040
Hurry.

410
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,200
Hong Ling.

411
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,840
It's these beggars who caused trouble.

412
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
Your Highness, please spare us.

413
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,360
We didn't mean it.

414
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
We've been starving for days.

415
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
A noble man was throwing money on the street.

416
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,960
We only picked up a few more.

417
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
I didn't expect it to be like this.

418
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,440
Your Highness.

419
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,960
I know those people very well.

420
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,400
They're just too hungry.

421
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,880
Some people

422
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,080
are cold-hearted.

423
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,160
Some people

424
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,480
are cold-hearted.

425
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,680
Just like Mr. Hao.

426
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Take them back.

427
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,560
Leave it to Mingfu.

428
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,520
Yes.

429
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,960
Go.

430
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,760
Your Highness.

431
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,920
Please spare us.

432
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
Your Highness.

433
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,080
Go.

434
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,160
Please spare us.

435
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,760
Go.

436
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,760
Have a drink.

437
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,280
Drink slowly.

438
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,600
Here.

439
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,980
People!

440
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,780
Is it better?

441
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,160
There's not much left.

442
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,400
How can his illness disappear?

443
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,320
the world will change.

444
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,880
The war between disaster and disaster

445
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,280
will turn into the world of refugees.

446
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,880
The world is not yet settled.

447
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,560
There will only be more and more refugees.

448
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,200
What?

449
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,120
You can't stand it just by seeing these?

450
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,560
Compared with those who are

451
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,040
unscrupulous and ungrateful,

452
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,600
they are lucky.

453
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,560
Those who have never escaped

454
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,560
the war between disaster and disaster,

455
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,880
some of them

456
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
are still wandering and struggling.

457
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,200
Some of them

458
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,680
are buried in the soil.

459
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
They don't even have a chance to live.

460
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,440
Dao Yong.

461
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,000
You are here too.

462
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,160
Goddess.

463
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,040
Goddess.

464
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,880
You are here.

465
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,280
Wu Niang.

466
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,960
Goddess.

467
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
Who is this lady?

468
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,080
Is she the newly-weds of the temple?

469
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,280
Wu Niang.

470
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
This lady is Sister Li.

471
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,600
She has been practicing in the temple.

472
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
She is busy today.

473
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,440
Tomorrow,

474
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,520
take Sister Li to the temple

475
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,560
to see her.

476
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,520
Is that okay?

477
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,560
Tuo.

478
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,720
Didn't you call me Li Changge?

479
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
When did you change your name?

480
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm just a skin.

481
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
It doesn't matter what you call me.

482
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,040
Fine.

483
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,280
I'll change my name.

484
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Be a new person.

485
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,080
Did you find her?

486
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,360
I didn't find her.

487
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,640
I also found her.

488
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,440
But I couldn't find her.

489
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Everyone, separate.

490
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,560
Hurry up.

491
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,560
Yes.

492
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,920
What happened?

493
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,360
Yuan Niang is missing.

494
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,600
Yuan Niang is missing.

495
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,840
You're the only one who's outside.

496
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,240
Didn't you see anyone running out?

497
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,800
Stop.

498
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,880
Xu Fang.

499
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm warning you.

500
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,120
If anything happens to Yuan Niang,

501
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,120
I'll settle it with you.

502
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,360
Wait until I give this life to Gongsun.

503
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,560
Find someone first.

504
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
Then you can do whatever you want.

505
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,680
Where are you going?

506
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
Yuan Niang.

507
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,800
Go.

508
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
Yuan Niang.

509
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,320
Are you okay?

510
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm fine.

511
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll take you up there.

512
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,320
Okay?

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,520
Come on.

514
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,480
Yuan Niang.

515
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,480
Why are you here?

516
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,680
Tomorrow is Mother's birthday.

517
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,160
I want to get some flowers for Mother.

518
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,520
I saw flowers on the tree.

519
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
But Yuan Niang couldn't reach them.

520
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,320
I didn't expect her to fall into this pit.

521
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,480
What a good girl.

522
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,280
What a filial child.

523
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,760
I wish her a safe and happy life.

524
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,200
It's the greatest wish of Gongsun Temple.

525
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,160
It's a pity that

526
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,240
we can't protect the family and the imperial family.

527
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,720
Okay.

528
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,520
Let's go back.

529
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,640
It's okay.

530
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,560
Don't make such a fuss in the future.

531
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,920
Does it hurt?

532
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,320
I'll go to count the number of injured people

533
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,560
and the families of each family.

534
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,480
Your Highness, please go with me to the Weiwen

535
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,760
to subsidize the families.

536
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,320
You can do these things for the good.

537
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,000
Why should I bring you here?

538
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
How can you talk to Brother Shuyu like this?

539
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,920
It started with you.

540
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,800
Shouldn't you be the one to make it up?

541
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
Sister, I'm kind and generous.

542
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
I'm beaten for money.

543
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,160
It hurts so much.

544
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,360
Let me be quiet.

545
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,800
You're the Crown Prince.

546
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,840
If you don't go,

547
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,320
should I go?

548
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,480
You said it.

549
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,560
You can go.

550
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,000
You're the Princess of Tang.

551
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,960
You're right.

552
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,840
You also went to the family

553
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,040
to subsidize the families of those...

554
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,160
those refugees.

555
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,200
Sister, I'm injured.

556
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,560
Let me rest for a few days.

557
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,760
I'll see how long you can act like a fool.

558
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,120
Sister.

559
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm sorry I caused you harm.

560
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,360
Forget it.

561
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,120
This time,

562
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,880
let me go there on your behalf.

563
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,280
I can do this.

564
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,880
Young Master Wei.

565
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,000
Young Master Wei,

566
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,840
I don't think we should walk around.

567
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,000
There are many ways

568
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Go with me.

569
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,080
Your Highness,

570
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,760
the Purple-Turban Palace is built by the people of Yang.

571
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,040
I think

572
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,840
you should go and inspect the people.

573
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,680
After all, His Majesty sent you here...

574
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,880
Yes, yes, yes.

575
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,400
I think you're right.

576
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,160
You should go and inspect Luo Yang.

577
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,600
Especially the Purple-Turban Palace.

578
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,480
Yang is so secretive.

579
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,880
I must go and check it out

580
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,080
and find out the truth.

581
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,960
Guards!

582
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,000
Prepare the mace.

583
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,760
Me, and Prince Fu.

584
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,760
Just wait.

585
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'd like to get in the 21st arrondissement and have a rest.

586
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,240
Themes from uso wu yi and shi yu.

587
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,320
I've got it all memorized.

588
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
Won't you ask Mr. Hao to come with you?

589
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,040
Why should I ask him to talk to me?

590
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
appeal the court of어지qing

591
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,360
to accompany you.

592
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,800
But

593
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
Mr. Hao is not here.

594
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm afraid.

595
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm not in Fuyang, but in Nanshan.

596
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,040
He won't find me.

597
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,640
Besides,

598
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
he can't be with me forever.

599
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,160
We need to protect ourselves.

600
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,440
Your Highness, you're back

601
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
in a different way.

602
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
It's good that Mr. Hao is not here.

603
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
Sometimes, when I see him,

604
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm still afraid.

605
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,360
Don't say that.

606
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,200
At first, I was afraid

607
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,520
when I saw him.

608
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,080
Before that?

609
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,360
You're not afraid now?

610
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Now?

611
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,200
Your Highness.

612
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,600
I finally found you.

613
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,120
Let's go.

614
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll take you home.

615
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,120
Yesterday, the Temple Master told me

616
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,480
to take you to Nanshan today.

617
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,200
Sister A'Li.

618
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,800
Is there something bothering you?

619
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,320
Yesterday, it seemed a little dull.

620
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,280
Why do you live in the temple?

621
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,920
Where are your family?

622
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,520
They're all gone.

623
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,400
Sister A'Li.

624
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,800
Here.

625
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,800
The Temple Master gave me this candy.

626
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
I can't bear to eat it.

627
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,920
You can have it.

628
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
You gave it to me?

629
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,760
Sister A'Li.

630
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,200
Don't be sad.

631
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,160
Actually,

632
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,600
my family is gone too.

633
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,760
Yesterday, they weren't your family.

634
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,240
My family was in Yunzhou.

635
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,840
When winter is coming,

636
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,720
people from the prairie will come to rob.

637
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Then, we suffered from disaster.

638
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,240
We couldn't live anymore.

639
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
My parents

640
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,880
took us out of the temple.

641
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,760
They said...

642
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,480
They said we could live if we went south.

643
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,360
But then,

644
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,200
my father got sick and died.

645
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,880
Then, my mother got sick too.

646
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,680
She said

647
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
ordinary people like us

648
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
can only rely on the heavens.

649
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,280
If the heavens want to take your life back,

650
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
we can only accept it.

651
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,960
That's not true.

652
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,400
But...

653
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
But there's no other way.

654
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
After my parents died,

655
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,160
I took my brother to Liuyun Pass.

656
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,000
A few days ago,

657
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,920
my brother got sick too.

658
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,480
I couldn't bear to leave him.

659
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,720
But everyone told me

660
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
that he wouldn't suffer anymore.

661
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,240
So, my brother wouldn't suffer anymore.

662
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,000
Am I right,

663
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,320
Sister A'Li?

664
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,320
Yes.

665
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,480
He wouldn't suffer anymore.

666
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,240
He's with your parents.

667
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,720
But I still can't be happy.

668
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,240
Aunt Chen told me

669
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,600
that my brother wouldn't suffer

670
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,920
in our family anymore.

671
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,000
But...

672
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,160
But I still can't bear it.

673
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,800
Sister A'Li,

674
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,480
what did we do wrong?

675
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Why can't the heavens

676
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,400
treat us well?

677
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,040
You didn't do anything wrong.

678
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,080
It's not just war.

679
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,040
I was born in a rich family.

680
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,240
My family was in the imperial jade family.

681
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,360
I was born in a rich family.

682
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,240
I was born in a rich family.

683
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,280
But everyone

684
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,680
wanted more.

685
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
I once thought that if I was born in a rich family,

686
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,160
I could live a stable life.

687
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,080
But I was wrong.

688
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,240
I should have known

689
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,600
that if I could die

690
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,240
and be free from the grudge,

691
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,960
it would be much easier.

692
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,880
Here.

693
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,080
Here you are.

694
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,360
Eat it.

695
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,680
Let's go.

696
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,120
A'Li,

697
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,440
what did I show you?

698
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,040
Zhenyuan,

699
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,800
can you teach me?

700
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,720
I want to save the refugees together.

701
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,600
Why do you have this grudge?

702
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,640
I feel so sad.

703
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,880
I feel so weak.

704
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,200
I can see the heaven and earth and all beings.

705
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,560
I seem to have left the devil.

706
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,680
We're finally in Luoyang.

707
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,880
Let's settle down here.

708
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,080
Mr. Qin,

709
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,080
is Changge really in Luoyang?

710
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,920
If you don't believe me,

711
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,880
go and find it yourself.

712
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,240
Xu Feng.

713
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,920
What's wrong with Mr. Qin?

714
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,000
Nothing.

715
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,600
He's afraid that he can't find your brother Li.

716
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,360
Qing prepares a proper meal today.

717
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,720
I'll take it.

718
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,200
Okay.

719
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,800
Wait.

720
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,680
Let's go after him.

721
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,080
He shell eat one!

722
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,180
Hit it.

723
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,040
Hit it.

724
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,320
Amore.

725
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,560
Sister Li,

726
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,120
you learn really fast.

727
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,680
You're more and more familiar with the books in the morning.

728
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
Everyone, quickly come here.

729
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,520
I have a extract from thedepartment for everyone.

730
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Princess.

731
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,020
Princess.

732
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,740
Princess, you are here.

733
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Bai Qian.

734
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,940
Are you fine?

735
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,220
Mr.ué

736
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
Why is this changed in the body

737
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,140
Mr.eger

738
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:29,200
Your並, Teng

739
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,840
Changge

740
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,300
Don't you hate me anymore

741
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,340
I was so persistent

742
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,000
Thank you for letting me have you.

743
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
I really thought

744
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,720
I would never see you again.

745
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,560
God wants us to meet again.

746
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,880
Don't cry.

747
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,880
How are you?

748
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Are you doing well?

749
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,560
After the farewell in Youzhou,

750
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,040
where did you go?

751
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,160
Did you go straight to Luoyang?

752
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,640
After leaving Youzhou,

753
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,200
I went north.

754
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,040
Then I met Sun Zhen.

755
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,120
It was a long journey.

756
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,400
It was a long journey.

757
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,880
It must have been hard.

758
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,400
You must have suffered a lot.

759
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,160
It's all in the past.

760
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,440
There's nothing to be worried about.

761
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,480
By the way,

762
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,880
we almost met each other before.

763
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,880
What do you mean?

764
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,080
The pouch I gave you,

765
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,120
I made it exactly the same.

766
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
I remember it now.

767
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,640
I was wondering

768
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
why someone knew

769
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,680
what your pouch looked like.

770
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,920
Why didn't you come to me?

771
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,600
I went to you.

772
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,120
But Hao Du was one step ahead of me.

773
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,000
Hao Du

774
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,760
is not a good person,

775
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,760
but he can protect you.

776
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,680
By the way,

777
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,240
why were you in Yunzhou?

778
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,140
That's why I went there.

779
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I greet Commander.

780
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,800
Where's the Princess?

781
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,840
She is by the upcoming road.

782
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,680
Princess.

783
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,880
Princess.

784
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,880
Princess,

785
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,960
General Hao is here.

786
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,160
Hao Du?

787
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,800
Hao Du.

788
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Changge.

789
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,560
Changge.

790
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,840
I have a lot to tell you.

791
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,360
Wait for me in the room tomorrow.

792
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,160
Hurry up.

793
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,400
Be careful.

794
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,000
Hurry up.

795
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,240
Hao Du.

796
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,920
I've done my job.

797
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,520
Let's go.

798
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,120
Wait for me.

799
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,160
What's wrong, Uncle Gong?

800
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,880
My stomach hurts.

801
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,920
Isn't there a doctor here?

802
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,560
Doctor.

803
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,080
No need.

804
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,360
My daughter is not feeling well.

805
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,840
Anrong.

806
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,800
Let me.

807
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,880
Take it.

808
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,400
Your Highness, hang in there.

809
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,520
The carriage is right ahead.

810
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,000
No.

811
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,480
What's going on with them?

812
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,080
Someone has reported that

813
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,200
the Crown Prince is in Luoyang City.

814
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,960
The refugees who were in the spring of the Qing Dynasty

815
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,040
are causing a lot of trouble in the city.

816
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,000
Such a mess.

817
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,080
I hope you can

818
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,800
stop your old affairs

819
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,320
and focus on your work.

820
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,440
Master Qin.

821
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,120
Why should we add one more person?

822
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,840
We can still find the Young Master.

823
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,040
Then why haven't we found Li Changge?

824
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,880
All right.

825
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
The situation in the city is unclear.

826
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
If we can find the Young Master as soon as possible,

827
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,360
we will be at ease.

828
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,320
Since it's a cooperation,

829
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,840
let's not waste time.

830
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,200
Cooperation?

831
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,600
Who wants to cooperate with him?

832
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
I don't know what he's thinking.

833
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,200
Do you want to fight with me?

834
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,320
Fine.

835
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,440
I think everyone has been holding you back for a long time.

836
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,920
If it weren't for Master Qin,

837
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,760
I would have beaten you to the ground.

838
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,120
All right.

839
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,960
Then you can try.

840
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
I'm getting old.

841
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,640
If you young people really want to fight,

842
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,640
go outside.

843
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,480
Don't demolish the house.

844
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,120
Let's go upstairs.

845
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,760
The scenery upstairs is good.

846
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,400
I won on the battlefield.

847
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,960
I don't accept it.

848
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,280
Come and fight.

849
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,120
Close the door.

850
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,120
Go, go.

851
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,200
Young people.

852
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,360
Say it, and come out.

853
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,680
Tomorrow, for money,

854
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,280
you have to compensate.

855
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,480
Is there such a young lady?

856
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,920
Whaddya want?

857
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,840
Want to steal?

858
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,520
How old the world is now?

859
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,880
Get to know you?

860
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,320
Just now

861
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,000
If you let me

862
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Like I said

863
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,640
During the war

864
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,320
You are under my command

865
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,120
Young people

866
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,860
You are under my command

867
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,380
Now

868
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,720
You have to fear

869
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,960
But I will fight

870
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,680
To tell you

871
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
Am I not a visualization

872
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,840
Young people

873
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,840
What can't be solved by fighting?

874
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,840
He can't even handle this little thing himself.

875
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,840
He really can't count on it.

876
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,840
This... This guy is quite good at fighting.

877
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Brothers, keep fighting.

878
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
He can't even handle it.

879
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
You win the bet.

880
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Before saying goodbye,

881
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I hope...

882
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,840
To keep your life

883
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,840
locked in my dream of longing.

884
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Before dawn,

885
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,840
before the years pass,

886
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,840
my longing flows.

887
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,840
There is always a moment

888
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,840
that burns into the wastelands in my heart.

889
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,840
There is always a longing

890
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:41,840
that unites us.

891
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
In different worlds,

892
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
in different worlds,

893
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,840
I walk through the four corners of the world.

894
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,840
In the deep night,

895
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,840
I become the cocoon in the dark night sky.

896
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,840
There is always a moment

897
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,840
that burns into the wastelands in my heart.

898
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,840
There is always a longing

899
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,840
that unites us.

900
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
In different worlds,

901
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,840
in different worlds,

902
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:34,840
I walk through the four corners of the world.

903
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,840
In the deep night,

904
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:45,840
I become the cocoon in the dark night sky.

905
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
In the deep night,

906
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:58,840
I become the cocoon in the dark night sky.
