1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning with him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life and the river of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I am telling you

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You are lucky to have been poisoned this time

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Next time, you will not have such good luck

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This cake is for your princess

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Such a beautiful gift

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a pity

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you mean?

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nothing

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I just want to tell you

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't think that only a little Khan supports you

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And forget who you are

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What the princess wants to do

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No one can stop it

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Changge

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Did you see Changge?

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She went to the embroiderer to learn embroidery

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Said she was going to give it to the princess

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hasn't she come back yet?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What happened?

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She is not coming back

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She is not coming back

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She is not coming back

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She is not coming back

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She is not coming back

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She is not coming back

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What happened?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nothing

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's time to have dinner

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or we should go to find her

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:21,600
The

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Shouldn't the crown prince be in Taiji Palace?

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why did he come to such a remote place?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The crown prince said there were many people in the palace

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It would be bad if someone recognized you

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So he chose to stay in this small house

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's also for you

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When did you follow the crown prince?

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A long time ago

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Too long

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I can't remember

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Here we are

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you don't remember it

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It should be before the change of fate

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why don't I remember you at all?

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You worry too much

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The crown prince is in there

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go in and talk

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Say it

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Who sent you?

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What is your purpose around the crown prince?

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go in and talk to the crown prince

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The princess is really a princess

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No wonder the master ordered me to be careful

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a pity

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Brother Sen

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Where have you been?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I haven't seen Ren Ying all day

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Where is Changge?

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She is in the palace

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Where is she?

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She is in the palace

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Where is she?

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She is in the palace

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Where is she?

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She is in the palace

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you see Changge today?

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I thought you went out to play

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's going to be quiet soon

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If Changge hasn't come back

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Something must have happened

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go back to the house first

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I suspect Princess Yicheng

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She is afraid of the poison of death

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And she is afraid of Changge

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So she was forced to come

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll go find her

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wait

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's no use being forced

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe I can find something to help

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They won't believe you

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Unless you kill me

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will not believe you

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I will not believe you

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will not believe you

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will not believe you

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will not believe you

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Unless you kill me

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You pretend to assassinate me later

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Only in this way

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's possible to gain Yicheng's trust

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Be careful

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You want to save Changge

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is too crazy

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's midnight

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How can you break into Anna's room?

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who is making a noise here?

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Where is Changge?

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Joke

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Your people are gone

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But come to ask me

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The whole Chang'an

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Only you will be interested in Changge

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ashile Sun

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I didn't expose your identity in front of the envoys of the tribes

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have already given you some face

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You actually for Li Tang's princess

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You are disrespectful to me

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If this is spread out

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The face of the grassland will be thrown away by you

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Ashile Sun

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are so rude

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ashile Sun

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Khatun is my savior

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You don't want to burn him

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Brother Sun

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Are you ok?

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I said I would go to find a person who can do the constipation

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And get a fake knife

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Look at you now

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How painful it is

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yicheng

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am sorry

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I am sorry

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am sorry

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I am sorry

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I am sorry

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am sorry

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am sorry

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am sorry

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am sorry

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am sorry

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I am sorry

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I am sorry

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I am sorry

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yicheng is so smart

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Even if he is really dead, he will definitely be trusted

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not to mention the fake knife

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,460
Mimi has already been

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is the best medicine for the wound of our Mo Nan

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Very effective

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What are you doing?

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then I will help you

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will help you

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ok, I know

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Brother Sun must be shy, right?

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will do it myself

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then I will put the medicine here

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Call me if you need help

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I am at the door

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Say it

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Say what?

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You have been doing things for Anna

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Since you are my Anna's person

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And also mine

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You will serve me to sleep tonight

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Come

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why?

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why did you sacrifice yourself to save Li Changge?

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because I can't see it

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You are acting with Sun Zai

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You can hurt him

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Say it

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What is your plan?

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Shun'er, I

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I won't tell Anna

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Shun'er

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Changge was caught by your Anna

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I beg you

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I beg you to save Changge

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why do you frame my Anna?

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The poison of the Chi Xi

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is what your Anna gave me

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Her body

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Is the fire to Changge

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Shun'er

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I know

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You have waited for a long time

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
To reunite with your Anna

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now I make you for me

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's hard to disobey your Anna's wish

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But I really have no other way

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now only you can help me

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I am sorry

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I am sorry

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I am sorry

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I am sorry

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I beg you to save Changge, okay?

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I beg you

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I am willing to go back to you

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
To serve you

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
To save Li Changge

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You are willing to sacrifice yourself

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If it weren't for Changge

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I would have died long ago

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I am not helping you

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to know the answer

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I know it's Anna who is behind this

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I just don't want to face it

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Tonight I may have to reveal the secret

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This woman is so fragile in my eyes

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why can she control Wang Ting step by step?

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Princess

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sheng Xin has succeeded

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't want to hurt her

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Li Changge can't die now

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I will use her to threaten Li Shimin

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
She is the key to the alliance

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't let her run away

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sheng Xin

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't have to go back to Li Chengqian

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What?

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You don't understand what I am saying?

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I understand

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I will go to the West suburb

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wait

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let Sheng Xin and Li Chengqian make a formal farewell

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You won't be late in handling it

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
In case you get yourself in trouble

235
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I understand, princess

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Changge is in the West suburb

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You really found out

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Zhenzhu, go to the Wei's house and inform Wei Shuyu to save her

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What about you?

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You go first

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I will wait for you here

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Go

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You don't have to struggle anymore, princess

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can't escape

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You are so useless

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Your life is still very valuable

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You want to threaten Tang with me

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You really look down on me

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Take her away

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Go

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't be afraid

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am here

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You can't kill me

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I am the crown prince's wife

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Once Li Changge's identity is exposed

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
None of you can live

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We can't kill her

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
She is the one who is in charge of the East Palace

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If we kill her, we can't kill anyone

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Mobei can't fight with Tang now

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
None of you can kill her

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Let's go

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Go

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Guards

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Mobei's envoy is planning to assassinate the crown prince

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
They want to kill him

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yes

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Guards

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Guards

271
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Sun

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Go

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Go

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Stop chasing

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We can't catch up

278
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Check if there is any fire

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Sun

281
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You shouldn't have killed Shengxian

282
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We shouldn't have bothered them

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If I can't find you tonight

284
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will kill Yicheng together

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't act rashly

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh my god

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I will go to the doctor

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You can't see what happened today

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Brother Sun

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I am a girl

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Give me the medicine

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ok

294
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Bear with it

296
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Go get the medicine

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Ok

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I shouldn't let you get hurt again

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I am fine

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But I am afraid I can't let this go

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The alliance is not done yet

302
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Tao Hua needs you

303
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
She won't give up easily

304
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You need to be a man

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Like the grasslands

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You need to support each other

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I won't kill Yicheng now

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I won't let her live well

310
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Changge

311
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Do you believe me?

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Your medicine

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Who died?

316
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Your highness

317
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's your servant

318
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Shengxin

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What?

320
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hurry

321
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Take off the white cloth

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Show it to me

323
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What?

324
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What?

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

327
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What?

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What?

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What?

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What?

331
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What?

333
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What?

334
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What?

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What?

336
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What?

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What?

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What?

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What?

340
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

341
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

342
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Who?

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Who killed my men?

344
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I will find out the truth

345
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And give you an explanation

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,440
to explain to His Highness.

347
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,560
Get him out of here.

348
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,160
If you can't catch the murderer

349
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,920
who killed Sheng Xin in an hour,

350
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,960
you...

351
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,280
You'll all be killed!

352
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,240
Your Highness!

353
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,080
Your Highness, something's wrong.

354
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,600
Sheng Xin is dead.

355
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,120
Li Changge was rescued too.

356
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,760
Who's the one who's been to Fengsheng?

357
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm incompetent.

358
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,160
I haven't checked it yet.

359
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
No more investigation.

360
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,160
It's me.

361
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,600
Anna.

362
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,400
Who is she?

363
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
She's a guard.

364
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,120
A guard who can come in and out

365
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,160
at any time

366
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,160
and discuss how to kill someone with me.

367
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
What do you want to say?

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
I heard you talking last night.

369
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,560
Anna.

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,960
I just want to know

371
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,560
if you did all this

372
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
for Ashile Tribe

373
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,720
or for Qiansui.

374
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,600
In your heart,

375
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
am I Khatun of Ashile Tribe

376
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
or Qiansui's princess

377
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,400
or your Anna?

378
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,520
No matter what my status is,

379
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,680
I'll always be your Anna.

380
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
We're blood-related.

381
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,440
The king of the grasslands

382
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,760
and the emperor of Qiansui

383
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
are all for the same purpose.

384
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,040
That's to say, my son

385
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,920
must take charge of everything.

386
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,560
Have you asked me if I'm willing to do it?

387
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,120
You're my son.

388
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,280
You deserve this.

389
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,160
Anna.

390
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,080
I used to think you were fragile.

391
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,240
Now I think you're strange.

392
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Take this and go back now.

393
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Go.

394
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,900
Go, hurry.

395
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
You're off to work now.

396
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,440
Happy now?

397
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Go.

398
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,360
What's going on?

399
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
What's going on?

400
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,280
Go and check it out.

401
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,080
I don't understand.

402
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,800
Look.

403
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,720
Look at the princess.

404
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,720
Is Princess Mobei here?

405
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,000
Please go out and check.

406
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,760
Search.

407
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,400
Yes.

408
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

409
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
You're a brave man.

410
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
But since you're here,

411
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
please come with me.

412
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,920
Okay.

413
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,000
But I have something to say.

414
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,240
I need to make a statement first.

415
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,200
Go ahead.

416
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,040
I'm the one who killed last night.

417
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,240
Ashile Tribe's Eagle Division's special envoy,

418
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,080
Ashile Sun.

419
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,080
He killed him.

420
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,960
He's Ashile Sun.

421
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,000
He killed him.

422
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,160
He killed him.

423
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,840
Yes.

424
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm ordered by Ashile Tribe's Khatun and Khan

425
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
to ambush the assassins

426
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,680
near Princess Mobei

427
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
to assassinate the Eastern Palace.

428
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,240
I've been thinking about his son all day and night.

429
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
But I feel so strange.

430
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,080
Mother.

431
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,960
Tell me.

433
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,960
Should I hate you and Shu Han?

434
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,880
Why did you separate us?

435
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Why did you make my son disobey me?

436
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,200
I dare not.

437
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,640
You dare not?

438
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,800
You ruined my plan.

439
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,640
Are you going to send me to Tang with him?

440
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,600
Mother.

441
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,680
I just feel bad.

442
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
I don't want to hide it anymore.

443
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,400
Mother.

444
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
Khatun, bad news.

445
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
Tang brought soldiers to us

446
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,680
to capture Khan.

447
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,560
What?

448
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,480
Khatun.

449
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,480
Ashile Sun, the assassin of the Eastern Palace,

450
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,320
has told us

451
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,000
that you and Khan are the assassins.

452
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What a joke.

453
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,600
With his words,

454
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,800
Tang wants to be the enemy of Ashile Tribe.

455
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,080
Don't panic, Khatun.

456
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,520
When I find out the truth,

457
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,360
I'll clear Khatun's name.

458
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,200
But

459
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,360
I need to take Khan back to ask him.

460
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Otherwise,

461
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,760
it's hard for the Crown Prince to explain.

462
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,760
How dare you!

463
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,560
Mother.

464
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,640
Ashile Tribe is always bright and bright.

465
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,800
Since Tang wants the truth,

466
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,200
I'm not afraid of the shadow.

467
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes.

468
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,280
Your Highness.

469
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,520
What's wrong with Khan?

470
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,760
He's punishing me.

471
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,320
Sun.

472
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,360
Changge.

473
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,160
Changge, you're injured.

474
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,320
Why are you here?

475
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,840
You gave me the dark magic potion last night.

476
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,680
Do you know what Ashile Sun is going to do?

477
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
Brother Sun didn't tell me about the plan.

478
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,640
He just asked me for help.

479
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I should have known

480
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,040
he liked you so much.

481
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,120
He could do anything for you.

482
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,160
He wants

483
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,880
to help you.

484
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,680
He wants to help you.

485
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
He wants to help you.

486
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
He wants to help you.

487
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
He wants to help you.

488
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,520
He wants to help you drag Ashile Tribe into the water.

489
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,640
I...

490
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,520
Can you help me

491
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,080
beg His Majesty

492
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
to spare their lives?

493
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
Actually, Sun Dejin killed Khan.

494
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,400
It's not good for him.

495
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,600
I don't care what Yicheng asks you to do.

496
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,240
I can't do it.

497
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,480
Changge.

498
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,800
You're the only one who can do it.

499
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,080
You're the only one who can beg His Majesty

500
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,200
to forgive you.

501
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,680
I know that saint better than any of you.

502
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,080
The so-called saint.

503
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
For the sake of Tang,

504
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,640
I even risked my life.

505
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,480
Not to mention Ashile Tribe.

506
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
Now Sun treats Shi'er

507
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
as a hostage and sends him to Tang.

508
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,040
He sacrificed his life

509
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:15,840
to get the

510
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:27,440
contexts

511
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,760
The state schools his title

512
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,120
If you want to choose just One

513
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,360
who knows the scales,

514
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,680
the Emperor,

515
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,680
and feel free from danger,

516
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,180
He will be okay as long as she lives.

517
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
All right.

518
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,600
or

519
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,020
from now on

520
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,280
I will remove him.

521
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:16,020
I will

522
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,160
and employ his province and showers himself with a鹤

523
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,200
The prince crossed the line

524
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,040
All three of them are loyal subjects

525
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,040
I don't have to see them anymore

526
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
Your Majesty

527
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,480
so have thought

528
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,280
The crown prince's family died in the battle.

529
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
But Ashile Tribe was responsible

530
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,680
for the assassination of the crown prince.

531
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,720
The Ashile Tribe should be executed.

532
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,680
After that, all the people will be executed.

533
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,640
Ashile Tribe will be dead.

534
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,760
All tribes of the desert will be united.

535
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,480
I didn't expect

536
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,560
I would agree to

537
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,480
the duke one day.

538
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,560
Ashile Khatun is in the temple.

539
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,960
He is now the only son of the duke.

540
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,280
But he has no reaction.

541
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,560
This is abnormal.

542
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,960
It seems that

543
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,040
this is not as smooth as

544
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,280
what the duke expected.

545
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,960
Your Majesty.

546
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,360
Rumors are spreading in the city

547
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,200
that Ashile Tribe is gathering troops to attack the capital.

548
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,960
All tribes of the desert are in danger.

549
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Yu'ne Temple

550
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,100
Xi'er

551
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,200
Chief, you are here.

552
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,040
Yes.

553
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,160
It seems

554
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,800
we shouldn't have come to the艾灯.

555
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,720
My original purpose was to find 해�

556
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,480
a strong plan for my tribemen.

557
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,080
Now I have almost lost my home.

558
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,720
This really ragged me.

559
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,320
What should Monan do?

560
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,800
We are all not alive.

561
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Ashile Tribe has hit him

562
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
into our home.

563
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,840
What about A natürlich?

564
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,880
How about Atah?

565
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,880
Can you dress up?

566
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,960
Your Highness,

567
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,160
the leader told Her Highness to stay in Chang'an.

568
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
She can't go back for now.

569
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,120
Atah said so.

570
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,840
It must be me.

571
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:28,960
You...

572
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,160
You...

573
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,600
You...

574
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
What did I tell you?

575
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,840
Don't go to harass Ashile Tribe.

576
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,800
Don't go to harass Ashile Tribe.

577
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,640
The fire of the Jianru Army

578
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,360
was caused by you.

579
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,080
Luckily,

580
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,360
the Iron Tribe is in good hands.

581
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,200
Look at you.

582
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,720
What's the benefit of working with Tang?

583
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
I advise you to leave tomorrow.

584
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,960
If you really fight,

585
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,360
Tang can save you.

586
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,480
Yes.

587
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,600
What should we do?

588
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,160
Yes.

589
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,200
We should leave tomorrow.

590
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,560
Leave tomorrow.

591
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,760
Let's leave tomorrow.

592
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Go.

593
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,120
Go.

594
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Leave tomorrow.

595
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,400
Leave tomorrow.

596
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Leave tomorrow.

597
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,680
Leave tomorrow.

598
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
That's right.

599
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,800
Yes.

600
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,040
That's right.

601
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
If they leave,

602
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
they will withdraw the army.

603
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,120
I think Ashile Tribe

604
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,040
has a lot of people.

605
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,760
They won't make it hard for you.

606
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,720
Yes.

607
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,480
Yes.

608
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,080
They will definitely make it hard for us.

609
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,800
Yes.

610
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,120
Let's go.

611
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,920
Then we should leave tomorrow.

612
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,360
We'll leave tomorrow.

613
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,440
We'll leave tomorrow.

614
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,640
It's a deal.

615
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,400
The princess wants to see you.

616
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,240
Changge, I know it.

617
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,600
I heard you were injured.

618
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,760
Are you all right?

619
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,360
Do you know about Sun?

620
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,120
Chengjian was so angry

621
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
that he had to kill him.

622
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,440
But don't worry.

623
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
At this critical moment,

624
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
he will be fine.

625
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,080
You...

626
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm fine, Your Highness.

627
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,760
Don't worry about me.

628
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,800
By the way,

629
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,320
Ashile Tribe is going to send troops.

630
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,520
Is there any response from Taiji Palace?

631
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,000
The news of Ashile Tribe's sending troops

632
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,960
is too sudden.

633
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,760
I haven't received the military report yet.

634
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
It takes ten days for the military report

635
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,360
to come from the border.

636
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,560
But this is

637
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,880
faster than the one from Chihou.

638
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,080
It has spread throughout Chang'an in such a short time.

639
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,920
This is a disorder of the people.

640
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,280
Leyan,

641
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,520
do you dare to take another risk with me?

642
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,840
Thank you.

643
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,280
All the ambassadors of the ministries

644
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,440
didn't have any questions.

645
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,880
They all thought that

646
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,760
this was a letter from their leader.

647
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,240
Even Princess Monan

648
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,360
thought that the letter she received

649
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,240
was written by Yinan.

650
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,520
They have confirmed

651
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,760
that Ashile Tribe's sending troops are going to the west.

652
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,400
They should be leaving Ch'an in a few days.

653
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,960
What else did you teach me?

654
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,440
Forget it, Leyan.

655
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,700
That's all.

656
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,400
Where have you been?

657
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,360
Where have you been?

658
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,720
Get out of my way.

659
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,460
Eat meat.

660
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,120
Leave now.

661
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Hook

662
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,600
Get up

663
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,880
Get up

664
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm going to beat you

665
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,200
You are a traitor

666
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
It's a fierce fight.

667
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Such a traitor

668
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,120
actually colluded with Ashile Tribe to murder me

669
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,720
and destroyed the alliance.

670
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,120
I took the man away today.

671
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,720
By the way,

672
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,120
the letters inside

673
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
are all faked.

674
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,720
Take them.

675
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,080
It's really the

676
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,840
¥ SU ayudá´ home of Doctor Shen.

677
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,840
What more

678
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,720
do I need to say?

679
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,180
Shen.

680
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,840
Station Training.

681
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:14,380
The

682
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Shi somos

683
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:19,760
Whether I have heard of it

684
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,640
or not

685
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,040
h hemVideo

686
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,120
shows

687
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,760
This is the

688
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,960
most important accessory in Tianle Tribe.

689
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,680
It doesn't belong to Chihe.

690
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,320
In Da Tao,

691
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,120
someone who can wear this accessory

692
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,360
is Zhi Xi.

693
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Zhi Xi is still alive.

694
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
It's Mimi Guli.

695
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,720
She didn't poison her.

696
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,680
I want Mimi Guli

697
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,400
to see how Bu Zhen

698
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,800
and Mu Jin died.

699
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,960
Besides,

700
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,760
Li Shimin wants to touch my son.

701
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
I want his daughter

702
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,240
and the whole Da Tao

703
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,320
to be buried with me.

704
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,240
Yes, Your Highness.

705
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,440
Where are they?

706
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,400
What are they doing?

707
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,440
What is Da Tao doing?

708
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,720
Why did they call us here so early?

709
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,880
What if Ashile Tribe

710
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,840
really attacks us?

711
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,880
Yes.

712
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,520
What's the use of

713
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,560
keeping us here?

714
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,840
If Ashile Tribe

715
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,040
really takes our tribe,

716
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,120
we'll be ruined.

717
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,640
What can we do?

718
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,480
Don't worry, emissaries.

719
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,800
The news of Ashile Tribe's attack

720
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
is a fake one.

721
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,200
A fake one?

722
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,960
Your Highness,

723
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,040
what do you mean by a fake one?

724
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,840
Ashile Tribe didn't attack us.

725
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,160
They didn't plan to attack the desert.

726
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,040
Bring them in.

727
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,000
The

728
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
The Iron Pond

729
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,520
He is the confidant of the Iron Pond.

730
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,320
He didn't die.

731
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,680
He didn't die.

732
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,520
What's going on?

733
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,200
Yes.

734
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Why did he die?

735
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,800
He was dead.

736
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,080
He was dead.

737
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,960
Everyone,

738
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,400
I'm the confidant.

739
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,800
I didn't die.

740
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,120
The Chiheng

741
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,840
was bought by the Ashile Tribe.

742
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,960
After the Great Tang was created,

743
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,240
he kept trying to persuade me

744
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,720
to oppose the alliance.

745
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,480
In order to destroy the alliance,

746
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,720
he tried to kill me.

747
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,840
If it weren't for the Princess of Mobei,

748
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm afraid

749
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,440
I would have been a ghost.

750
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,520
Princess of Mobei?

751
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,000
What's wrong with you?

752
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,880
Come in.

753
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,720
I'll be brief.

754
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,600
Ashile Tribe wanted to poison you

755
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
and then they framed me.

756
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
They destroyed the alliance

757
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,920
between the Chiheng and the Great Tang.

758
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,480
What?

759
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,440
Nonsense.

760
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,360
You don't have to make a conclusion.

761
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,720
You'll know

762
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,240
if I'm lying or not tomorrow.

763
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,280
This medicine

764
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,200
will make your nose bleed.

765
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,440
It's the same as the symptom of being poisoned.

766
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
But it won't harm your life.

767
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,680
What do you want to say?

768
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,080
You won't believe me.

769
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,600
You'll know

770
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
if someone kills you tomorrow.

771
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
As for whether you want to change the medicine,

772
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,800
you decide.

773
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,320
Even if you're telling the truth,

774
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,600
why are you helping me?

775
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm not helping you.

776
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm helping the whole desert.

777
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,160
If there's no support from the Great Tang,

778
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,080
we'll only be

779
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,560
dragged by Ashile Tribe.

780
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,600
He's really a bad guy.

781
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,960
Actually, at first,

782
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,480
I didn't believe what Princess Mobei said.

783
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
But who knew

784
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
she'd say the same

785
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,600
the next day?

786
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,280
Envoy Zhi Xi,

787
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,640
your maid is not feeling well today.

788
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Let me help her

789
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
to deliver the breakfast.

790
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,040
Okay.

791
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,160
But why did Princess Mobei

792
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,400
know about this?

793
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,240
She even prepared

794
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,520
the medicine for Zhi Xi's death.

795
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,120
Yeah.

796
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,360
Ashile Tribe wanted to frame me

797
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,960
for the medicine.

798
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,120
They threatened my maid.

799
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,080
But they underestimated

800
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,800
our relationship.

801
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,000
That day,

802
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Princess Mobei saw my intention.

803
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,080
It's time to serve the Princess.

804
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,400
Put the poison in Zhi Xi's food.

805
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
And then give it to Li Changge.

806
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,800
Or

807
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
think about your brother.

808
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,640
Mimi.

809
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,080
What's wrong?

810
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,480
You look flustered.

811
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,080
I'm fine.

812
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Did Yicheng threaten you?

813
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Changge.

814
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
He asked me

815
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
to poison Zhi Xi

816
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
and frame you

817
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,080
to destroy the alliance.

818
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
That's so vicious.

819
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,080
He even killed someone

820
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,080
to destroy the alliance.

821
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Since he threatened you,

822
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
just do it.

823
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Or he'll make it hard for you.

824
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
But...

825
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
It's okay.

826
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
I can help you.

827
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Don't worry.

828
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
I'll protect you.

829
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,080
I won't let anything happen to you.

830
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
Just let Zhi Xi die.

831
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Then we can clarify it.

832
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Will Zhi Xi die?

833
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
We can only bet.

834
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
But

835
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I bet he will.

836
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
If I didn't see it with my own eyes

837
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
and heard it with my own ears,

838
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I wouldn't believe it either.

839
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
I kept it hidden

840
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
and didn't show it.

841
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
I just want to see

842
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,080
what Ashile Tribe

843
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,080
is doing.

844
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
I want to

845
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,080
meet you

846
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,080
before we say goodbye

847
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I want to meet you

848
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
I want to

849
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
hear your voice

850
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,080
and fall into my tender dream

851
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Before dawn

852
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,080
before the years

853
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,080
my longing flows

854
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,080
There's always a moment

855
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:53,080
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

856
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,080
There's always a longing

857
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
that's between you and me

858
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,080
and it's all in front of me

859
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
In different worlds

860
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,080
in different worlds

861
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,080
I'm missing you

862
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,080
I'm missing you

863
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I'm missing you

864
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,080
I'm missing you

865
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,080
I'm missing you

866
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,080
I'm missing you

867
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,080
I'm missing you

868
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,080
I'm missing you

869
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
I'm missing you

870
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,080
I'm missing you

871
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,080
I'm missing you

872
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,080
I'm missing you

873
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,080
I'm missing you

874
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,080
There's always a longing

875
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,080
that's between you and me

876
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,080
and it's all in front of me

877
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,080
In different worlds

878
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
in different worlds

879
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,080
in different worlds

880
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,080
I'm missing you

881
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,080
I'm missing you

882
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,080
I'm missing you

883
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,080
Before dawn
