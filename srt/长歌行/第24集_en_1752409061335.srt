1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
To the distance

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Forget you

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
This is the look of a stubborn person

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
To return to the long hope in the dark night

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Climb the river of life and do not forget the light

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Episode 16

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Later, father sent some people to tie him up

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Send to your Eagle Division

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
No need

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
This female slave has already fallen into the appetite of her son

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Let her serve Sher

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
In my opinion

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Very compatible

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Ok, then father will follow you

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
What else do you want?

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Father will give it all to you

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I heard that Mo Nan

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
For Kuri Tai, he entered the palace for a bottle of good wine for a hundred years

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
I want to ask father for a bowl to drink

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Don't say it's a bowl

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
The whole jar is here

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
You and my father, let's drink together

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Zan Bai

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Zan Bai

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Zan Bai

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Great

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
I, the boy on the grassland, have to be as good as you

35
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Tomorrow's hunting is your great victory

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Shush

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Son has been injured

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
If tomorrow's hunting is not as good as before

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I would rather be absent

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Sun, this is not like what you said

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Today's fight has already turned the Hezi

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Just leave tomorrow's game opportunity to Sher

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I am more seriously injured than you today

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm afraid you're going to see me lose face again

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Shuhan, no matter how hurt I am today

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Even if I have to find my face

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I have to get it back from Ashile Sun

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
He doesn't go hunting

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Even if I win the first place, so what?

50
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
You two brothers

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
In a word from the Central Plains people

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
That is to sacrifice to the nuclear power

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
All right, then tomorrow's hunting

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I agree with you

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Stay here to heal

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Thank you, father

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Thank you, Shuhan

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Then I'll go down first

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
What are you and Ashile Sun thinking about?

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Xiao Kang misunderstood

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I just simply don't want to go back to Eagle Division

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
You think I will believe it?

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
He suddenly proposed not to participate in hunting

64
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
This is not his character at all

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
What do you want?

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Whether you believe it or not is your business

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I don't believe it

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I don't believe it

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I don't believe it

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I don't believe it

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I don't believe it

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I don't believe it

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I don't believe it

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I don't believe it

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I don't believe it

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Whether you believe it or not is your business

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I just fought Ashile Sun in front of Great Khan

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
What does he want?

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Ask him if you can

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
How can I know?

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I don't know what the hell you are doing

82
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
If you don't want to go with him

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Why don't you say it earlier?

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
You don't want to go with him

85
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Not necessarily Mimi doesn't want to go with me

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
So it's for this

87
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Little Khan doesn't feel sorry

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I promise Mimi won't come back even if she dies

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I promise you

90
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I promise you

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I promise you

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I promise you

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
I promise you

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I promise you

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I promise you

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I promise you

97
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I promise you

98
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I promise you

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I promise you

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I promise you

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I promise you

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I promise you

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I promise you

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I promise you

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
I promise you

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I promise you

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
I promise you

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I promise you

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
I promise you

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
I promise you

111
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I promise you

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I promise you

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I promise you

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I promise you

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I promise you

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I promise you

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I promise you

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I promise you

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I promise you

120
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I promise you

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I promise you

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I promise you

123
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I promise you

124
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I promise you

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I promise you

126
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I promise you

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I promise you

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I promise you

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I promise you

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I promise you

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I promise you

132
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I promise you

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I promise you

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I promise you

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I promise you

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I promise you

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I promise you

138
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I promise you

139
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I promise you

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I promise you

141
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I promise you

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I promise you

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I promise you

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I promise you

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I promise you

146
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I promise you

147
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I promise you

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I promise you

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I promise you

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
I promise you

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,640
that I will It's

152
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
something between people

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Between people

154
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Is there anyone

155
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
that you love?

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
No

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
No

158
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
I promised someone else.

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,440
I can't tell you.

160
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,920
Who did you promise?

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Princess Yicheng.

162
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,520
You can't save Luo Yi.

163
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,640
And Yicheng can't either.

164
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,080
Don't be so self-righteous, okay?

165
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Why don't you go to the forest?

166
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm not going to the forest.

167
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm going to the forest.

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
I'm going to the forest.

169
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
I've already noticed your intention.

170
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
I don't care what you plan to do in the future.

171
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,760
I hope you won't get in my way.

172
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,720
How's your wound?

173
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,840
I can't die.

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,680
Sun.

175
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm already grateful to you.

176
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,560
If you really want to thank me,

177
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
just listen to me this time.

178
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,560
Okay?

179
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,240
Go.

180
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,480
Don't get involved in this.

181
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,320
Fire Eagle Division.

182
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,520
I need to get better.

183
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Tegin, why are you...

184
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,120
Arrange some people

185
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
to stay here.

186
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
What is Tegin going to do?

187
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
Report to me immediately

188
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,360
no matter what happens in the tent.

189
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,360
Especially about Luo Yi.

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,360
Yes.

191
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll let Sher know

192
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,880
that I'm back to Eagle Division.

193
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,880
Understood.

194
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,520
Retreat.

195
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,680
Wu.

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,360
We can get up early

197
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,080
and arrive in Luoyang earlier.

198
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
After we arrive in Luoyang,

199
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll find you a good doctor

200
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,000
to check your illness.

201
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm not sick.

202
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,800
I just want to sleep.

203
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,360
Our food is gone.

204
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,600
It's okay.

205
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
We're getting closer to Luoyang.

206
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Didn't you notice?

207
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
The villages we've been through these days

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,480
have been abandoned by the farmers.

209
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
If we keep going,

210
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm afraid it'll be hard for us

211
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
to get food again.

212
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,000
Wu.

213
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,840
There's no other way.

214
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,920
We can definitely get to Luoyang.

215
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,160
Wu.

216
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,600
Wu.

217
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
I see that you've lost weight

218
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,320
these days.

219
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,480
I happen to have some stomach cramps.

220
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,320
I can't eat anything these days.

221
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,960
You can eat

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,400
all the cakes today.

223
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,560
Wu.

224
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,640
You don't even know how to lie.

225
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,080
How can you live

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,480
in this world?

227
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,520
Yes.

228
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
Listen to what I'm saying.

229
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,800
Wu.

230
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,240
With Wu,

231
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
I can starve my sister to death.

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,600
Khan.

233
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,320
The leaders of the hunting

234
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,280
are waiting for you outside the camp.

235
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,200
Let's go.

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
Let's go.

237
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Yes.

238
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,840
Khan.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,920
Last night, Ashile Sun went back to the Eagle Division to heal himself.

240
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,640
He knew that

241
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,040
the hunting team of Khan had just set off.

242
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
He hasn't come back yet.

243
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,720
Maybe

244
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,320
you're thinking too much.

245
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,480
Thinking too much?

246
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,400
But Ashile Sun

247
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,800
never lets me think too much.

248
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,440
Tell him to be careful.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,560
Yes.

250
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,040
Report, Khan.

251
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,160
What's wrong?

252
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
Khan's blood-sucking horse

253
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
ran out.

254
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,400
The guards are searching for him.

255
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,080
It happened after Khan left?

256
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,800
Yes.

257
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
It might be because Khan left.

258
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,160
He can't stand the temper.

259
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,840
No.

260
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,120
What a coincidence.

261
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,520
Tu Luhe.

262
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,080
Let's go.

263
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,920
Let's go to the slave camp

264
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,200
to see whether Li Changge is still there.

265
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
Where's the new slave?

266
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,760
Siqi.

267
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
He was working with us this morning.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
Then he disappeared.

269
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,000
No one's here.

270
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,840
He's really the one who did it.

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,880
When did he disappear?

272
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,560
He said he went out to work early in the morning.

273
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,720
Did he sneak out

274
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,680
while the guards were not paying attention?

275
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,120
No.

276
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,600
What's wrong?

277
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,880
Did they do something

278
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,920
while Khan was away?

279
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,480
Now the most strict guard in the imperial court

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,400
is Luo Yi.

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,320
Hurry up.

282
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,240
Go to Luo Yi's cell.

283
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,720
Aunt Ayer.

284
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,480
Aunt Ayer.

285
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
You're going to fetch water so early today?

286
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,560
The water from Khatun hasn't been here for two days.

287
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
You're swimming so fast.

288
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,920
Hey.

289
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Coon.

290
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Greetings, Khatun.

291
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Get up.

292
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Thank you, Khatun.

293
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
I'm not used to drinking the water from the dam.

294
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I've been asked to go to the river to fetch water for A'Yi.

295
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
You know that.

296
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Yesterday, at the Kulitai Conference,

297
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I took a bath on purpose.

298
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
So I used up all the water.

299
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Did I cause you trouble?

300
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Khatun, don't be ridiculous.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Khatun needs water.

302
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
I'll go to A'Yi's Valley.

303
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Go.

304
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
By the way,

305
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I heard that you've got a new daughter.

306
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I made a pair of shoes for the child.

307
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Come and get them when you get the position.

308
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
And bring some milk to share with everyone.

309
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
How can I be so shy?

310
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Khatun is always like this.

311
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
He often cares about us.

312
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
It's just a little bit of kindness.

313
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
It's Li Changge.

315
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
No one helps.

316
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
He can't take the old man away.

317
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,400
And the old man is so badly injured.

318
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
He can't run far.

319
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Tu Ke,

320
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
tell the people in the prison not to look for any horses.

321
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Go to find someone.

322
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Yes.

323
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Wait.

324
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Find a group of wolves.

325
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
What's wrong, Xiao Kaka?

326
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I think they didn't run far.

327
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Let's go after them separately.

328
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Yes.

329
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Go.

330
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Go.

331
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I didn't expect that Luo Yi

332
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
would escape from the trap.

333
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
It's worth it even if he dies today.

334
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Luo,

335
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
your leg is bleeding again.

336
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
It's okay.

337
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Yang,

338
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
you risked your life

339
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
to do all these for us.

340
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Thank you, Changge.

341
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Madam,

342
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
I thank you too.

343
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Thank you.

344
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Thank you.

345
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Changge,

346
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
did you contact Luo Shiba?

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I played the tune

348
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
as Master Luo ordered last night.

349
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Okay.

350
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
He should be around here.

351
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Luo, let me help you.

352
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Okay.

353
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Tegin,

354
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
you were right.

355
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Luo Yi has escaped.

356
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
The guards of the whole camp

357
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
have gone after him.

358
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Where is Sher?

359
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I think they are chasing him.

360
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Call a team of people.

361
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Follow me.

362
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Yes.

363
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
What are you doing?

364
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Did Luo Yi run away

365
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
because of you?

366
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
It had nothing to do with me.

367
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Now it does.

368
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
What's wrong with you?

369
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm fine.

370
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm fine.

371
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm fine.

372
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm fine.

373
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
It's about time.

374
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Sun,

375
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
you can't go.

376
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
He is the eyes of Great Khan

377
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
and the general of Li's Hall.

378
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
If you are related to him,

379
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
you can't make it clear.

380
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Wait.

381
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Wait.

382
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Why is the blood here?

383
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Take her away.

384
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Yes.

385
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Go.

386
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Go.

387
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Go.

388
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Go.

389
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Go.

390
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Go.

391
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Go.

392
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Open the door.

393
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Open the door.

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Go.

395
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Go.

396
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Go.

397
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Go.

398
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Go.

399
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Go.

400
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,680
to flag them away from Furthermore,

401
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,240
Yes.

402
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,440
Giddy up.

403
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
Great horse.

404
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
I've been a horse rider for my whole life.

405
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,040
It's worth it to tame a horse.

406
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,160
General Luo,

407
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,080
I'll give you a horse to ride.

408
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,560
Okay.

409
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,400
Luo Shiba?

410
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,400
Changge,

411
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,960
what did I say just now?

412
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,240
Shiba,

413
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,080
good boy.

414
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,280
Get in.

415
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,120
Let's go.

416
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,400
Well done.

417
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,760
Well done.

418
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
each piece of medal

419
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,200
One could be moved per block of gold

420
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,080
don't think too much

421
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,880
The hundred could be flown

422
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,980
the give scratch

423
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,920
The hundred could be flown

424
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,680
Go.

425
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,200
18th, you take General Luo away.

426
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
I'll lure him away.

427
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,080
There must be a accomplice helping us out.

428
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
Yong Ning can't fool me.

429
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
It's not a good idea.

430
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,320
Then I'll leave with 18th

431
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,200
and lure them away

432
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,920
to General Ji.

433
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,600
No need.

434
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,240
It seems that the destiny is like this.

435
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,840
My fate

436
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,320
is today.

437
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
In Tang,

438
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm a traitor who rebels.

439
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,320
In the prairie,

440
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm an enemy who deserves to be killed.

441
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Where can I escape?

442
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,040
My fate is here today.

443
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,040
It's here.

444
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,680
No.

445
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,560
General,

446
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,520
I'll save you out no matter what.

447
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
I'm so lucky.

448
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,880
I've been living on my own until today.

449
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,880
I even got a chance to atone for my sins.

450
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,720
Even if I have to die here,

451
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,400
I won't leave you alone

452
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,160
and die alone.

453
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Luo Shiba,

454
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,120
listen.

455
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,760
From now on,

456
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,840
Li Changge

457
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,680
is your new master.

458
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,760
You should surrender.

459
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,120
Do you want to disobey my order?

460
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,760
General Luo,

461
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,040
what are you doing?

462
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,160
Princess Yongning,

463
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,120
today,

464
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,760
I entrust Luo Shiba to you.

465
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Yan Yun, Shiba Jin,

466
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,200
he was born into my family.

467
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,400
Now, he's the only one left.

468
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,520
I watched him grow up.

469
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,480
He's more like a father than a master.

470
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,720
Today,

471
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,960
I'll give you

472
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
my daughter.

473
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,360
General.

474
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,920
You're still young.

475
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,200
Don't die for me.

476
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,520
I'll live on.

477
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,040
I'll do whatever I want

478
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,920
and die on the battlefield.

479
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,640
We'll have a happy ending.

480
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,240
Luo Shiba,

481
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,280
this is the last order

482
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,320
I gave you.

483
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,960
Leave Changge now.

484
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,120
General.

485
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,240
Go!

486
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,680
Stop them!

487
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,800
Seriously.

488
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,880
Let's chase after them.

489
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,520
Let's medicaly.

490
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,820
any carefree you want.

491
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,660
You can just run away.

492
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,300
temos siempre twistado de wayos AirPods

493
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,200
Oscar

494
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,020
it can't be.

495
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,780
The process of death.

496
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,760
You can just let yourself dwindle easily.

497
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,560
I...

498
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,260
I have 30,000 dollars.

499
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,440
I can earn a living from this!

500
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,520
Be careful.

501
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,160
Try it.

502
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,720
If you lose bit,

503
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,640
to escape?

504
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,640
18th,

505
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,240
you're better than me.

506
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
You'll escape as soon as you get a chance.

507
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,200
Escape?

508
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,320
No one can escape.

509
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,880
I want to live.

510
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,800
Kill them!

511
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm not a man.

512
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm my man.

513
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm taking him away today.

514
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,520
Why do you think

515
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,400
you have the right to talk to me like that?

516
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,600
Sun Taiji,

517
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,720
calm down.

518
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,920
Sher,

519
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,120
you'll never understand

520
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,880
what it means to fight for protection.

521
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,720
The more you like something,

522
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
the more I want to destroy it.

523
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,200
I just want you to try

524
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
the feeling of being taken away

525
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,160
from the one you love.

526
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
You're just a coward

527
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,880
who doesn't want to grow up.

528
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,280
Say that again.

529
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
You're a coward

530
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,800
who doesn't want to grow up.

531
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,400
Say that again.

532
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,560
Coward!

533
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
You should understand that

534
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,360
this is between you and me.

535
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,400
It has nothing to do with them.

536
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,520
Sun Taiji,

537
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,240
you can let Li Changge go.

538
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,200
You can take a step back.

539
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,960
Let's go.

540
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,840
Brother, don't chase them.

541
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,480
Let them go.

542
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Didn't you hear

543
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,840
what that bastard said just now?

544
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,040
I didn't hear anything.

545
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,920
I didn't hear anything.

546
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,960
I didn't hear anything.

547
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,040
Xiao Kehan, please calm down.

548
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,680
Maybe this time,

549
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,480
we can hit the Eagle Division hard.

550
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,840
That slave

551
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,400
seems to be your man in Dakahang.

552
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,200
He released Luo Yi

553
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,640
and colluded with the spy of Eagle Division.

554
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,560
It also proves that the sword in Weishui

555
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,000
was intended to save Li Shimin.

556
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,360
But now,

557
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,240
this spy

558
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,720
was rescued by Ashile Sun.

559
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,640
You let him go

560
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,040
so that you can get rid of yourself

561
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
and drag the whole Eagle Division into the water.

562
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I didn't do anything

563
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,640
more than this.

564
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,880
Business?

565
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I never wanted to do business

566
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,640
with Ashile Sun.

567
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,080
He is my prey.

568
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,120
I want to win him.

569
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,600
I want the whole grassland to admit that I'm better than him.

570
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,880
Have you ever thought about it for the princess?

571
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,640
It's my duty to let Xiao Kehan

572
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,400
control the power of the grassland.

573
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,880
As long as I can get rid of Eagle Division

574
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,920
for the princess,

575
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,200
I can do anything.

576
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,640
Eagle Division

577
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,080
Sun, stop.

578
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Sun.

579
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,040
Why did you ask me out?

580
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,440
Sher has seen

581
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
the people of Eagle Division coming to pick me up.

582
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,400
What should I do next?

583
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,920
This is something I need to think about.

584
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Leave it to me.

585
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,160
Mu Jin?

586
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,480
Sun, I finally found you.

587
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Why are you here?

588
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,960
You rescued him?

589
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,000
Yes.

590
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,800
Brother Fei sent a letter.

591
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,560
Take a look.

592
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,320
What's wrong?

593
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,720
Take him away.

594
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
What happened?

595
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,720
Don't ask so many questions.

596
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,720
Take him away.

597
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,480
No.

598
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,240
What will you do if I leave?

599
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,960
This is my business.

600
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,480
Leave me alone.

601
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,760
But if I leave now,

602
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,000
everyone has seen you rescue me.

603
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
How can you avoid it?

604
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
I'm not afraid of you.

605
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm not afraid of you.

606
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,760
I'm not afraid of you.

607
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm not afraid of you.

608
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm not afraid of you.

609
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,440
I'm not afraid of you.

610
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
I'm not afraid of you.

611
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
How can you avoid it?

612
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,280
One person does things, one person does things.

613
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,760
I won't leave like this.

614
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,960
If I leave,

615
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,880
all the people in Eagle Division will...

616
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,680
Shut up!

617
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,840
Who do you think you are?

618
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,200
You think you're so great?

619
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,120
You never belong to the grasslands.

620
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,560
No matter what happened in Eagle Division,

621
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,720
it has nothing to do with you.

622
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,720
Ashile Sun.

623
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,120
Don't think you can solve everything by yourself.

624
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,440
If you knew it,

625
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,000
why did you do it?

626
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,600
Did you rescue Luo Yi?

627
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,240
What did I tell you?

628
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,920
Now Luo Yi is dead.

629
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,800
You beat yourself up

630
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
and beat me and Eagle Division.

631
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,800
Ruo An.

632
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,920
Ruo An.

633
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,920
You deserve it.

634
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,360
Li Changge.

635
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,400
This is the consequence

636
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:24,920
of your shut- rubbish.

637
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,960
I won't leave now.

638
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,880
You've caused enough trouble for me.

639
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,960
From now on,

640
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,440
we have nothing to do with Eagle Division.

641
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
Go back to The Forbidden City.

642
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
Get out!

643
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,000
Wu Ji.

644
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,660
Tie him up and take him back to Bianjing.

645
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,300
focused military counselor

646
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
I can walk on my own.

647
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
Didn't you hear what I said?

648
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,000
Follow her and send her back to the Central Plains.

649
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,160
Yes.

650
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,240
Shiba, let's go.

651
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,000
Get up.

652
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,240
No matter what General Luo said,

653
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,480
you don't have to follow my order.

654
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,640
You...

655
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,720
Yanyun's rules.

656
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,880
You have to obey them and you'll die.

657
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,440
You can talk?

658
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,320
Yes.

659
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,960
Why didn't you say anything before?

660
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,600
Because it's unnecessary.

661
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,400
Anyway,

662
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,280
you don't have to follow my order anymore.

663
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,520
You can go.

664
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,520
Go?

665
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,880
Where?

666
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,080
Go wherever you want.

667
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,080
Do whatever you want.

668
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,760
You're free now.

669
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,360
No one can control you.

670
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,120
Free?

671
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,080
What are you doing here?

672
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,240
Are you afraid I'll be late?

673
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,120
It's true what you said.

674
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,720
Did you read the letter?

675
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,760
What?

676
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,040
Where did you get the letter?

677
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,320
From the toothed man.

678
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,600
It's a pigeon's blood.

679
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,800
It means it's a fire chicken.

680
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,240
I didn't read the letter.

681
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,320
But I felt something.

682
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,120
I saw it.

683
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,600
It's a pair of earrings.

684
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
Earrings?

685
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,040
Is there any woman

686
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,760
related to Sun in the tooth?

687
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,400
Tan'er.

688
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,480
Tan'er?

689
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,520
Isn't Sun Guo'er?

690
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,000
Sun's foster mother is called A'ye.

691
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,960
If A'ye hadn't picked up

692
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
the young Sun

693
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,000
and raised him,

694
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
Sun would have died long ago.

695
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,280
All these years,

696
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
Great Khan has kept A'ye in the tooth.

697
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,320
To ensure Sun's loyalty.

698
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,160
No wonder Sun is so obedient.

699
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,440
It's all because of A'ye.

700
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,800
What are you doing?

701
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,480
Mother.

702
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,840
It's all a trap.

703
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,840
If A'ye goes back alone,

704
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,000
it will be dangerous.

705
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,600
A'ye must be in trouble now.

706
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Go now.

707
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,440
Why are you here?

708
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,040
You said you could go anywhere.

709
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,280
I want to go to the tomb.

710
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,200
I can go anywhere.

711
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
I want to save A'ye.

712
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,280
Call the Eagle Division.

713
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,080
If we can't,

714
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,080
we can use the bridge.

715
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,120
Sher!

716
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,600
You're finally here.

717
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,760
Sher!

718
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,640
For the sake of our relationship,

719
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,200
don't involve innocent people.

720
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,320
Fine.

721
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,960
As long as you kneel down and admit my mistake,

722
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,120
I may spare his life.

723
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,080
Sher!

724
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,280
Sher, how dare you!

725
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
Why not?

726
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,680
Now his life is in your hands.

727
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,040
It's up to you whether you kneel down or not.

728
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,000
It seems that you need someone to help you.

729
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,560
Sher,

730
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
don't try to escape.

731
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,240
I'm ready for you to die.

732
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,240
But Ser fire will come and kill you.

733
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:42,600
Okay.

734
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,320
Don't restrain yourself.

735
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,520
Sher!

736
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,920
You have the strength and speed.

737
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,080
Sher,

738
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,680
you're a coward.

739
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,520
If...

740
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,120
If you have the ability,

741
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,440
fight me with the boats on the board.

742
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,880
Don't make me singあります you.

743
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,800
Zun Tegin,

744
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,680
telling the truth is your mouth's job.

745
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,920
You don't deserve

746
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,720
to talk to the Khan.

747
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,160
It's not my fault.

748
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Su Nian,

749
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,240
magnificent!

750
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,200
Bravo!

751
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:29,400
Obeye the great

752
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,280
and put down your grasp.

753
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,320
Since you're kneeling,

754
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
why don't you kowtow

755
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,520
and cheer us up?

756
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,200
What?

757
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,520
Your dignity is more important than your daughter's life?

758
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,320
Thanks for yeast

759
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,360
Success if I have knew it

760
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,160
timeless

761
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,060
Watch me

762
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,040
So why don't you kowtow

763
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,360
and cheer us up?

764
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,240
Why don't you kowtow

765
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,520
And cheer us up

766
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,820
If you can cal 읽サウト

767
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,400
I'll write it with sorrow

768
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,980
Yes

769
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,580
People didn't know

770
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,600
Your face gold

771
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,500
and light

772
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,740
Your figure

773
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:41,180
Locked in my dream of longing

774
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,900
Before dawn

775
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,260
Between the years

776
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,140
The longing flows repeatedly

777
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,580
There is always such a moment

778
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:59,460
Burned into the wastelands in my heart

779
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,860
There is always such a attachment

780
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,980
Between you and me

781
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,580
We face each other

782
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,020
In our world

783
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,380
In different worlds

784
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:21,960
I

785
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,540
Turned into eternity

786
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:30,060
Sp Warried

787
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:40,060
There is always a moment that burns down the wastelands in my heart

788
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:50,060
There is always a sense of attachment between you and me, that unites us

789
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:56,060
In each other's world, in different worlds

790
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:02,060
I am in the middle of longing

791
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:08,060
That little bit of attachment has become eternity

792
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:13,060
The cocoon of time

793
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,060
Unite us
