1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Look at the future

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is the look of a stubborn person

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life, the river of hope

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The Legend of Chusen

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Brother Li Chang

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have no way to escape

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hurry up and turn back

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:55,040
Follow me to the

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Legend of Chusen

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Chang'an is really lively

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Much more interesting than our grasslands

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What you see is not necessarily the truth

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The prosperity in front of this

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Not necessarily long

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Legend of Chusen

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What to do

26
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yang Jian, three dollars

27
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hurry up

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Move

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Move

30
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Move

31
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Be careful

32
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Be careful

33
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No eyes

34
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You are so cruel

35
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How dare you

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I see you are alive

37
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No more trouble

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Go

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Go

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
People of the Crown Prince's Mansion

41
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you so cruel?

42
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's the Crown Prince's Mansion

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This

44
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sir, I am sorry

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Please forgive me

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Get out of here

47
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes

48
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Go

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you okay?

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are not afraid

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How dare you fight the Crown Prince's Mansion

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But there is no reason to hide

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I won't talk to you for a day

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I won't be able to walk away next time

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Go

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If this young man doesn't show up

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I will beat those grasslands to the ground

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't forget our purpose in Chang'an

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't affect the world

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Go

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mother

64
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Chang'ge

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mother

66
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why do you have so many hairs?

67
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you not feeling well?

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am fine

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I am old

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I will get old

71
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I won't get old

72
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I will never get old

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will never get sick

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I will always be like now

75
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You are so sweet

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Did you sneak out today?

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I did sneak out

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But don't worry, Mother

79
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I am fine

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Chang'ge

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have something to tell you

82
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What is it?

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why are you so serious?

84
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Chang'ge

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are always so noisy

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I never care about you

87
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But this time

88
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You promised me

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You will stay in the mansion tomorrow

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You won't come out

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why?

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I heard the ambassador of Ashile Tribe

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
came without asking

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now he is in Chang'an

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The people from the grasslands are coming?

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why are they coming to Chang'an?

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Although they are coming

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They asked to cut the grassland

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Everyone knows it is just a excuse

100
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They are here to compare the grassland with us?

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This time we will have a good show

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Chang'ge

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When your grandfather started his career

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He promised to marry Ashile Tribe

105
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Although it was a good chance

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But now the city is at war

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And there are many women in the palace

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What I am worried about

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Is that they will come back to the old story

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Mother

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is the old story from many years ago

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They may not remember it

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You are so worried

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Chang'ge

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You are still young

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It is better not to know about it

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't want anything else

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I just hope you can live in Chang'an

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
peacefully

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and peacefully

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Madam, you are looking for the crown prince

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He is back

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Mother, you are looking for father?

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I think he just came back

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He is not free

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I will go later

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Chang'ge

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You should stay in the room

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't make your father unhappy

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Madam

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My mother doesn't want to see father

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why do I want to see him?

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It seems that the child

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
is really going to be on my head

135
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Brother, we can't let it go

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We should deal with it as soon as possible

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go back to the study

138
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Chang'he, I am here

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Send someone to keep an eye on Hongyi Palace

140
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If there is any noise

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Report to me

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes

143
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Brother, don't wait anymore

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This old man

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
A'jie

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
A'jie

147
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why are you here?

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't you like this place?

149
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Highness

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I heard that

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The envoy of the Shile Tribe

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
came to Chang'an suddenly

153
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If they ask about the marriage tomorrow

154
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This was decided by A'jie

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
How can I decide?

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You don't have to worry about

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the Miao Tang

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is the dessert I gave you

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Is there anything else?

161
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I am fine

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Good

164
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you are fine

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Don't come here

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
again

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes

168
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I am fine

169
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I

170
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The Miao Tang

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
A'jie

172
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A'jie

173
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You are so timid

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You are still scared

175
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If I am not by your side in the future

176
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What will you do?

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Chang'ge, you are getting worse

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's go

179
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I will take you to see your husband

180
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't have any husband

181
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Shuyu is staying at the court

182
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't you want to see her?

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Brother Shuyu

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why should I see her?

185
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Since the beginning of the new year

186
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Shuyu has taken you from the river

187
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You will be happy every time you see her

188
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Leyan

189
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Leyan

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you okay?

191
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You think I am blind?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, right

193
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Here

194
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This is for you

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So ugly

196
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What is this?

197
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I am so ugly

198
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to get this hand

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It is a little ugly

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I like it

201
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let me see

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It is okay

203
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's go, or the competition will be over

204
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I have something for you

205
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is the safety suit

206
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I asked for from the temple

207
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is for you

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The other one

209
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Is for brother Shuyu

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You asked for it

211
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You should give it to him

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Put this on

213
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What is this for?

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
To keep you from being recognized

215
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have to protect you

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What about you?

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I am not afraid of anyone

218
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's go

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Please

220
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Don't kill me

221
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't kill me

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I didn't do anything wrong

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Please

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't kill me

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Please

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't kill me

227
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't kill me

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I didn't betray the king

229
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Please

230
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't kill me

231
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't kill me

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Go

233
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Meiyan

234
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Leyan

235
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hao Du is not a good person

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Stay away from him

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Brother Shuyu told me

238
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He is cold-blooded

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Forget it

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's go to kill Shuyu

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Go

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Come

243
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The field is big

244
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Good

245
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Good

246
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good

247
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Good

248
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hold on

249
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Go

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Go

251
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The amulet

252
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The amulet is gone

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It is lost

254
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Give it to him

255
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,280
We meet every day.

257
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,240
You can get more than a hundred

258
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,760
of them when you go to the temple.

259
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,680
Take it.

260
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,480
But except this time,

261
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,080
when will you see him again?

262
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
Good.

263
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,040
Go.

264
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,800
Come on, go.

265
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,080
Look at his strength.

266
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,520
Look.

267
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,360
I pleasure feelings!

268
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,320
Thanks to Shige.

269
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,000
Shige, thanks to you!

270
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,360
Nice shot.

271
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,980
Good job!

272
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Shall we go for falling rocks and do it again?

273
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,320
Or...

274
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Orwing it to break the last tile.

275
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,480
The last one?

276
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,320
Shake it.

277
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,360
We escaped smoothly,

278
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,240
but it was a good BC kiss from the offering tonight.

279
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,000
I want to carryとか!

280
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,960
What kind of buoyant security Angular 2 is?

281
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:19,960
엄청 с kau Institut

282
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,620
D

283
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Valladolid

284
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Hold on. Hold on.

285
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Brother Cheng.

286
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Slow down.

287
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Your Highness.

288
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Don't underestimate this sword.

289
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
This sword is made of copper and iron.

290
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,960
It can kill people without a sound.

291
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Your Highness.

292
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Do you want to try it yourself?

293
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
The messenger is really cool.

294
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
I think this sword is like a thunderbolt of the two armies.

295
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
It's more like a weapon.

296
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,960
It's powerful and powerful.

297
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,960
I think the player of Tang is a strong man.

298
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
The winner is decided.

299
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
There's nothing to see.

300
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
You don't know who's the winner.

301
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
The messenger spoke out his words in public.

302
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Aren't you afraid that you will be the one who will be humiliated?

303
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
You.

304
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
My second brother

305
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
is a man of a good heart.

306
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
He doesn't know what to say.

307
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Don't underestimate this sword.

308
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
It's a sharp sword.

309
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Why don't we make a bet

310
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
and reward the warrior?

311
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I heard that the king of Qin is very generous.

312
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Today,

313
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I saw that he was just a smart man.

314
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
The crown prince is still a great man.

315
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
The emperor of Tang and the crown prince

316
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
have been trying to fix it.

317
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,960
In the past, the emperor of Tang promised to marry Ashile Tribe.

318
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Why don't we take this opportunity

319
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,960
to settle this matter?

320
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
What?

321
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Who is that young lady from the prince's family?

322
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
The King of Qin

323
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Young Master,

324
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
it's badly injured.

325
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
You need to take it slowly.

326
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Young Master, you can't do that.

327
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Today's battle is about the reputation of Tang.

328
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
How can I escape from it?

329
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
I'm afraid that

330
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
I will leave a trace in the future.

331
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Young Master.

332
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Sir,

333
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
don't worry.

334
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I've been a swordsman since I was a child.

335
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm fine.

336
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Brother Shuyu.

337
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Why are you here?

338
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Does it hurt?

339
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
My lady.

340
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
It's just a small wound.

341
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Don't worry.

342
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Look, it's all healed.

343
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
This is the safety talisman

344
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
for you.

345
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
If I could have given it to you earlier,

346
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
you wouldn't have been injured.

347
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Thank you.

348
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
I...

349
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
I'll go out and help her.

350
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
The King of Qin

351
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
I didn't expect that

352
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
someone would dare to die on the battlefield.

353
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
It's the same for everyone.

354
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Kill him.

355
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Ignore them.

356
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
You two will be killed.

357
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Kill him.

358
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Kill him.

359
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
I want to

360
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
win.

361
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Yes.

362
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Yan Xingzhen.

363
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
You're not afraid of me?

364
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Please.

365
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Yan Xingzhen.

366
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Yan Xingzhen.

367
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Great.

368
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Great.

369
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Yan Xingzhen.

370
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Yan Xingzhen, good job.

371
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Yan Xingzhen, good job.

372
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Great.

373
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Yan Xingzhen.

374
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Great.

375
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Great.

376
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
Great.

377
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Great.

378
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Great.

379
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Great.

380
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,080
Diese greetings

Good.

383

Good.

384
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,000
Good.

385
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Good.

386
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,600
Good.

387
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,320
Good.

388
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,120
Good.

389
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,920
Good.

390
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,720
Good.

391
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,440
Good.

392
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,200
Good.

393
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Good.

394
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,800
Good.

395
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,560
Good.

396
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,320
Good.

397
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,120
Good.

398
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,960
17 points for Tang.

399
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,680
17 points for Ashile Tribe.

400
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,080
Your clothes are so pretty.

401
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,520
Yes, I've been choosing it for a long time.

402
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,480
Come on.

403
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,240
Go.

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Don't be afraid.

405
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,520
Fight.

406
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,800
Pilates I yes.

407
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Great!

408
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Great!

409
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,280
The time is up.

410
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,880
18 rounds of the Tang Dynasty.

411
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,480
17 rounds of Ashile Tribe.

412
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,880
Tang Dynasty wins.

413
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,080
Tang Dynasty wins!

414
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Tang Dynasty?

415
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Of course, Changge wins.

416
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,880
Except for her,

417
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,280
who can make those grasslanders

418
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
play the game?

419
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Dad!

420
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,680
Your Highness.

421
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm here to see you back

422
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,880
as ordered by Prince Qin.

423
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,880
How did Father know?

424
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,280
Father...

425
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,480
I'm just following orders.

426
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,880
Leyan.

427
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,880
Prince Qin will ask you back.

428
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
You go back first.

429
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,480
I'll talk to Changge.

430
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,480
I...

431
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,880
Don't be afraid.

432
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
You're a fairy.

433
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,280
Good job, Your Highness.

434
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
Good job.

435
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Great!

436
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,680
Tang Dynasty wins.

437
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,480
This knife

438
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
belongs to you.

439
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,680
Give this knife to that boy

440
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
later.

441
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,480
Yes.

442
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,280
Great!

443
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,280
Good job.

444
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Wait, messenger.

445
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,080
The messenger mentioned

446
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,280
the repair.

447
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,280
We need to think about it.

448
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,280
The lady on the stage

449
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,080
is indeed the most famous

450
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,280
in Tang Dynasty.

451
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,280
Messenger.

452
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Can we go to the Eastern Palace

453
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,280
for a while?

454
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,880
We can discuss it

455
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
in detail.

456
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,280
Since you're so sincere,

457
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,480
I'll be honest with you.

458
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,760
wasted pleasantries

459
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,480
great

460
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,480
Good.

461
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,280
The music was great.

462
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,280
Amazing.

463
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,820
Let's have dinner.

464
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,620
Thank you.

465
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,060
This ball is heavy.

466
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,540
If we throw it at the kid,

467
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,780
it's impossible to take the result.

468
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,500
Don't be like this.

469
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,760
As the old saying goes,

470
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,260
we should remember to bring luck and honor.

471
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,980
This?

472
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,920
The Crown Prince

473
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,940
ordered Ashile Tribe to offer a treasure stone

474
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,300
to you.

475
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,440
How can an empty bottle

476
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,340
be broken off with an empty jewel?

477
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,560
Does the bones sound so familiar?

478
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,420
It's said

479
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,260
that the Alhabaan

480
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,740
is really terrifying.

481
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,860
What blame is that?

482
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
At this time, he's wearing a mask.

483
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
How ridiculous!

484
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
He didn't even tell us his name.

485
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
Sun Tegin

486
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
Shi Xin Sili greets Sun Tegin

487
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Why is Sun Tegin in such a mood today?

488
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Why did you come to the camp in person?

489
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
I wanted to check their skills.

490
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
How was it?

491
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
If they were in the battlefield,

492
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
they would have been fully equipped.

493
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
But the guy who came in later

494
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
was quite smart.

495
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
I don't know what he's from.

496
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
The key of the people in the Eastern Palace

497
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
is above level eight.

498
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Sun Tegin really knows everything.

499
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Speaking of which,

500
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
when it comes to the marriage proposal today,

501
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Li Jiancheng is really hooked.

502
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
But this matter,

503
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
do you want to inform the Great Khan in advance?

504
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
No need.

505
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Such a situation,

506
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
it seems that the military power of the Tang Dynasty is really poor.

507
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Great Khan, you don't have to worry about it.

508
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
The group of ten is scheduled to leave the city tomorrow.

509
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Do you want to change the route?

510
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
No.

511
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Leave the city as scheduled.

512
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Leave the city as scheduled.

513
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
Second Uncle.

514
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
It hurts, Second Uncle. Let go.

515
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
This bad guy.

516
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
He even wants to borrow the wind tunnel.

517
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Why did he come to my place?

518
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
Uncle,

519
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260
I came today because I have a gift for you.

520
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,260
Gift?

521
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
Show me.

522
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
I'll show you.

523
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
I'll show you.

524
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,260
I'll show you.

525
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
I'll show you.

526
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
I'll show you.

527
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Show me.

528
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
This is what you just won.

529
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
How can you give it to me?

530
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
Since Yong Ning was seven or eight years old,

531
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260
he has been training with Uncle.

532
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
Uncle gave me martial arts and military skills.

533
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I was able to fight in the city today.

534
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
I have nothing to repay since I died.

535
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Since this short knife was won by Yong Ning personally,

536
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I will give it to Uncle.

537
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
Xiao Yong Ning

538
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Xiao Yong Ning has grown up.

539
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
Today, you are outstanding.

540
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
You used military skills to train your soldiers.

541
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
You did well.

542
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
It's really a good knife.

543
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
You...

544
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
It's all because of this dress.

545
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
If it wasn't for this dress, I would have won against Uncle.

546
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
Fei Ye,

547
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
that move was a trick I left behind.

548
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
You were eager to win,

549
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,260
so you fell into a trap.

550
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
But Uncle is stronger than me.

551
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
If I don't use my military skills,

552
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,260
how can I win?

553
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
If you are strong, you will be weak.

554
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
If you are not as strong as others,

555
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
you can only gain fame and wealth,

556
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
and wait until you grow up and fight against the enemy.

557
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Then I have to read other people's books.

558
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
This is the price of the weak.

559
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Although it's hard, you have to accept it.

560
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,260
Only then can you survive

561
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
and overcome the difficulties.

562
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
Whether it's one person or the world,

563
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
it's almost like this.

564
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
Chang Ge,

565
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
you must remember.

566
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Okay, I will remember, Uncle.

567
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
Okay, go back first.

568
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
Do you have anything else to do?

569
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Okay, I will visit you another day.

570
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Chang Ge.

571
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
Go back and say hello to your mother for me.

572
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Okay.

573
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
Go back.

574
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Your Highness.

575
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Forgive me for being late.

576
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
The tail of the late Empress

577
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
has been too long these days.

578
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Chang Ge.

579
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,260
Hello, Aunt.

580
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Today, the boy on the court

581
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
is you, right?

582
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
I didn't mean to

583
