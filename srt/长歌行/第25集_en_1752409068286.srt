I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To sing a song of hope for him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the light of life and the light of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can sing happily

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600

Since you're kneeling.

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,920

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,620
Anna.

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,500

Kill him.

47
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,580
I didn't kill him.

48
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,700
He did it.

49
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,940
It's too late.

50
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,940
Sun.

51
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,980
Sun.

52
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,180
Sun.

53
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,340
Sun.

54
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,980
Sun Daqin.

55
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,980
Sun Daqin.

56
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,500
Sun.

57
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,180
Get off me.

58
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,140
Find Sun Daqin.

59
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,660
Hurry.

60
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,220
Look at A Yan.

61
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,660
Sun.

62
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,500
Find Sun Daqin.

63
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,020
Sun.

64
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
Sun.

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,580

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,820
No.

68
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,740
Mother.

69
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,300
Mother.

70
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,020
Sheng.

71
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,940
Sheng.

72
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,060
Mother, are you okay?

73
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,500
Step aside.

74
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,660
Don't, Sun.

75
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,740
I'm not your mother.

76
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
I'm your mother.

77
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
I'm your mother.

78
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
I'm your mother.

79
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,900
Don't, Sun.

80
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,980
I beg you.

81
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,260
Please forgive me and A Yan.

82
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,460
I beg you.

83
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,140
Don't hurt Sheng.

84
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,140
I'm afraid, Sun.

85
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,860
Sun.

86
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,860
A Yan died at my knife.

87
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,220
Kill me if you want.

88
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,340
Don't hurt my mother.

89
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,140
No.

90
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,700
I'm her mother.

91
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,260
I'll die for her.

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,060
Don't hurt her.

93
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,900
No.

94
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,020
Zhen.

95
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
How is he?

96
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,900
A Ran is not Okay.

97
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,580
Father.

98
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,140
varies It's okay.

99
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,060
Are you okay?

100
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Are you okay?

101
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,660
Acupoint.

102
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,320
A heads up head will most likely be deadized by Someone's

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,400
trap.

104
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,760
bee

105
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,540
Anyone?

106
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,820
Put your hands up if you dare to diss Raven,

107
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,240
we'll be the Voussaste Gang!

108
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,280
Anyone?

109
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,780
The Death's Head is here.

110
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,840
Take Ashile Sh failed.

111
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,380
paste

112
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,700
Take the fan down!

113
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,220
Yes!

114
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,740
Sun!

115
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,740
Sun!

116
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,380
Get out of the way!

117
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,140
Sun!

118
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,580
Calm down!

119
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,060
Sun!

120
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,660
Calm down?

121
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,540
I told you not to act rashly.

122
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,300
Did you listen to me?

123
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,060
If you didn't do it on purpose,

124
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,220
why did you become like this?

125
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,340
If you didn't do it on purpose,

126
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,820
why would my father die?

127
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
The Dragon's World

128
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,340
Mother.

129
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,820
It's him.

130
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,500
Take him away.

131
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,180
Gather the Dragon's World.

132
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,980
Go after them now.

133
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,580
Wait!

134
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,820
Let them go.

135
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,620
Wang Ting is in such a mess.

136
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,580
He's injured badly.

137
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,740
How are you going to explain it?

138
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,540
Go after them!

139
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,020
What's wrong?

140
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,620
Mother.

141
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
There's a river over there.

142
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,860
It's dry.

143
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,060
The river is dry.

144
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,300
You can hide inside.

145
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,300
And Shiba.

146
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,860
Protect A'Yao's body.

147
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,980
What about you?

148
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,860
I'll take everyone to the right.

149
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,220
You're going to lure the Wolf Division away?

150
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,260
Yes.

151
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,780
When I lure the Wolf Division away,

152
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,380
you'll take Sun

153
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,260
to get better.

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,860
No.

155
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,860
Sun will hate me when he wakes up.

156
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,100
He won't.

157
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,220
I killed his father.

158
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,260
And I got Yingshi involved.

159
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,020
I can't get him to hate me.

160
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,940
It's too risky for you to do that.

161
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,140
Mother.

162
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,260
Yingshi can't be without Sun.

163
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,340
You're the only one who can protect Sun.

164
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,180
The crimes I want to get rid of

165
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,020
will be cleared when Great Khan returns.

166
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,660
Only you can protect Sun.

167
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,940
Go!

168
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,340
We're running out of time. Go!

169
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,980
Yingshi, Qian Feng, listen to my order.

170
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,300
Command by Military Advisor Li.

171
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,540
Yes.

172
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,580
Yingshi, Qian Feng, follow me.

173
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,760
Get up, lock up!

174
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,940
Remembern!

175
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,620
Wake up, bastard.

176
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,780
Mom, don't sleep!

177
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,540
Hurry!

178
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,180
Listen to my order, Your Highness.

179
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,660
Ashile Tribe has military orders.

180
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:27,840
They won't kill their own tribe's war

181
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,020
and surrender immediately.

182
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
But what about you, little military counselor?

183
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,300
I let Luo Yi go.

184
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,340
They won't let me go.

185
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll run away myself.

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,100
Don't worry about me.

187
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,860
But...

188
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,100
Remember what I said just now.

189
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,580
It's important to save your life.

190
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,540
I have nothing to do with Eagle Division now.

191
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,220
Don't worry about me.

192
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:47,980
Retreat!

193
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,700
Retreat!

194
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,900
Chase them with all your might!

195
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,660
Yes!

196
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,620
Retreat!

197
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,340
What's wrong with the special forces?

198
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,300
Moji!

199
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,900
What's wrong with the special forces?

200
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Call the military counselor!

201
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,340
I'll go right now.

202
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,380
Wu Yi!

203
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,180
Moji!

204
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,140
Moji!

205
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,660
Wait!

206
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,020
What's wrong with the special forces?

207
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,860
Where's Changge?

208
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,420
Why didn't Changge come back with you?

209
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,820
We didn't have time to explain to you.

210
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,380
Where is she?

211
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,940
Where is she?

212
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,860
Help me up.

213
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,860
Help me up.

214
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,380
Sister Sunna.

215
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,980
Sister Sunna.

216
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,340
Sunna.

217
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,740
Where's my mother?

218
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,380
Where's my mother?

219
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,740
We've brought back

220
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,620
A'Yan's body.

221
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,140
I want to see her.

222
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,260
Moji.

223
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,180
Take me to see her.

224
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,180
I want to see her.

225
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,460
I want to see her.

226
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,020
I want to see her.

227
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,620
I want to see her.

228
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,220
I want to see her.

229
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,020
I want to see her.

230
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,820
I want to see her.

231
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,580
I want to see her.

232
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,380
I want to see her.

233
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,140
I want to see her.

234
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,940
I want to see her.

235
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,580
I want to see her.

236
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,300
I want to see her.

237
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,980
I want to see her.

238
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,820
I want to see her.

239
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,580
I want to see her.

240
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,420
I want to see her.

241
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,180
I want to see her.

242
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,820
I want to see her.

243
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,580
I want to see her.

244
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,340
I want to see her.

245
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,100
I want to see her.

246
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,780
I want to see her.

247
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,620
I want to see her.

248
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,420
I want to see her.

249
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,220
I want to see her.

250
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,980
I want to see her.

251
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:51,220
ת Tupstr flute

252
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,980
Father really ye dued the Armenians and was murdered by the officers.

253
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,900
He never let my sister suffer alone.

254
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,280
Yunxiang.

255
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,900
They're not what they look like.

256
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,240
Sad communications

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,420
are the 거지re Fatherild of Adam J nuevo.

258
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,940
There'll be no sadness too.

259
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,600
It's good that the King Pan and Pig 인 time

260
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
If I don't care about you,

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
you won't be the one to suffer.

262
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
But I was wrong.

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,680
If I knew it now,

264
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,200
I would have given up everything

265
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,040
to get you back.

266
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,440
The winning and losing

267
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,040
is not as important as family and clan's safety.

268
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,960
Anna,

269
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,040
don't worry.

270
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,800
I won't be impulsive anymore.

271
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,160
I won't do those

272
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
murderous things again.

273
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,360
Now I just want to protect

274
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
those I can protect.

275
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,240
I won't let you go.

276
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,840
I won't let them suffer like you.

277
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,520
You must rest assured.

278
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
I will protect

279
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,440
your kindness in the next life.

280
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
The End

281
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,440
Drink the medicine.

282
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,000
Sit down.

283
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,320
Where are the others?

284
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
Su Yishe and others

285
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,040
were captured by the Wolf Division.

286
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
They are not at risk.

287
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Where is Li Changge?

288
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,040
Has she gone back to the Central Plains?

289
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,040
She...

290
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,520
She has left with Su Yishe and others.

291
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,000
I have sent someone to find her.

292
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
Luo Shiba has gone, too.

293
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,120
Baozi,

294
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
what do you mean?

295
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,120
Say something.

296
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
She led the Wolf Division's soldiers away for you.

297
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,080
Now...

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Now we don't know where she is.

299
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
Sun, you haven't recovered yet.

300
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
You must take care of yourself.

301
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,440
I must find her.

302
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
Don't stop me.

303
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,920
Sun.

304
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,680
Sun.

305
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,200
Changge finally saved your life.

306
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
You can't go to the death now.

307
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
I have lost my father.

308
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,960
I can't lose him anymore.

309
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,680
He is not familiar with the grasslands.

310
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
He will not live.

311
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
Li Changge said

312
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,840
you must keep yourself safe.

313
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
You can't waste her efforts.

314
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
I can't, either.

315
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,880
I have sent everyone to find her.

316
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
I will go, too.

317
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,440
I will tell you as soon as I get news.

318
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,960
You must live to wait for her.

319
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,040
Li Changge.

320
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,440
Where are you going?

321
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
I am going to find Changge.

322
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
You don't even know where Changge is.

323
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Where are you going to find her?

324
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
Everyone is looking for her.

325
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
Why can't I do it?

326
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,040
Changge came out of the Imperial Court.

327
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
She must be walking towards the Eagle Division now.

328
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
And I believe

329
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,120
as long as she has a breath of air,

330
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
she will climb back to see me.

331
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
I am going to find her.

332
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,800
I will go with you.

333
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,480
I will go with you.

334
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,280
I will go with you.

335
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
I will go with you.

336
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
I will go with you.

337
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
I will go with you.

338
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I will go with you.

339
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I will go with you.

340
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,080
God of Heaven and Wolf, please bless me.

341
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,480
The sword has finally been taken out.

342
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,080
Ketun should be safe.

343
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
That's good.

344
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,040
Little Khan.

345
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Ketun is here.

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,080
You shouldn't get close.

347
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,600
Since Ketun is safe,

348
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,360
I think you should go back

349
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
first, Little Khan.

350
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,520
All of you can go in and out

351
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
to help her and look after her.

352
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,920
But I can't.

353
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,280
Little Khan.

354
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Ketun treats us well.

355
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,040
We are all in his heart.

356
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,880
At such an important time,

357
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,560
we will take good care of her.

358
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,680
Little Khan, don't worry.

359
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,400
You are standing here.

360
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,560
If Great Khan knows,

361
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,520
he will surely bring trouble to Ketun.

362
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,280
You should go back.

363
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,280
I will go.

364
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,200
Little Khan.

365
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,440
You don't even have the right

366
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
to visit your mother.

367
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,560
What am I, Little Khan?

368
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,520
You are so mean.

369
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,040
Sher, you are a coward.

370
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,280
Mother.

371
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,400
Ashile Sun.

372
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,480
Why did we come to this point?

373
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,880
What have we done

374
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,880
for all these years?

375
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,960
If I weren't Little Khan,

376
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,800
you wouldn't have gone to Eagle Division.

377
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,280
Would we be good brothers?

378
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,920
Yes.

379
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Little Khan.

380
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,560
The cavalry that was in the Imperial Court

381
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,640
has been captured and locked up in the prison.

382
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Where is Ashile Sun?

383
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,960
We didn't find him when we were chasing him.

384
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
The scout just reported that

385
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,320
he had been taken back to Eagle Division.

386
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,520
I knew

387
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,040
he wouldn't die so easily.

388
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,560
This time,

389
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,000
we missed the best chance to kill Ashile Sun.

390
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,200
It will be more difficult

391
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
to kill him in the future.

392
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,600
You seem to want to kill him more than I do.

393
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
Isn't it our goal

394
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
to destroy Eagle Division?

395
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,840
Little Khan, you are soft-hearted.

396
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,800
I...

397
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm not.

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
Little Khan, don't you forget

399
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
the expectations of Great Khan?

400
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,520
You will never be willing

401
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
to be suppressed by Ashile Sun forever, right?

402
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,400
I don't know

403
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
if you can be with Khatun

404
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
after you defeat Ashile Sun.

405
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
But I'm sure

406
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,360
if you can't win,

407
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,600
Great Khan will never allow you to meet Khatun again.

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,840
Little Khan, don't forget.

409
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,760
If Khatun didn't kill you to stop you from fighting,

410
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,160
Ashile Sun would have pierced your throat with that sword.

411
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,400
Did he ever show mercy to you?

412
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,440
Little Khan is kind to his enemy

413
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320
but cruel to himself.

414
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
If Khatun didn't kill him,

415
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,960
you would lose your Anna forever.

416
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,280
Enough!

417
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,760
I don't need you to remind me.

418
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Where is Li Changge?

419
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,160
When we surrounded him,

420
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,480
we suddenly killed

421
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,360
an unrivaled swordsman.

422
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,760
He was killed by the sword.

423
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,960
He was killed by the sword.

424
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
He was killed by the sword.

425
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
He was killed by the sword.

426
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
He was killed by the sword.

427
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
He was killed by the sword.

428
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
He was killed by the sword.

429
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
He was killed by the sword.

430
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
He was killed by the sword.

431
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
He was killed by the sword.

432
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
He was killed by the sword.

433
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
He was killed by the sword.

434
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
He was killed by the sword.

435
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
He was killed by the sword.

436
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
He was killed by the sword.

437
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
He was killed by the sword.

438
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
He was killed by the sword.

439
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
He was killed by the sword.

440
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
He was killed by the sword.

441
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
He was killed by the sword.

442
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
He was killed by the sword.

443
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
He was killed by the sword.

444
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
He was killed by the sword.

445
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
He was killed by the sword.

446
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,160
It is the master of the Room.

447
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,400
No.

448
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:45,300
Look.

449
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,900
Eeny meeny pink.

450
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Ru천.

451
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
It's the master of the Room.

452
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
No.

453
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Look at Chuan Zhu.

454
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
They were members of Central Plain.

455
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,500
is not going to Eagle Division.

456
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,900
Does anyone else know about this?

457
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,860
Except for the person in charge of the chase,

458
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,460
no one knows.

459
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,300
Let's go.

460
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,860
Changge.

461
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,180
Where are you?

462
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,140
I'm here.

463
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,260
Although she's a woman,

464
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
she's a hero.

465
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,540
She's a heroine who never gives up.

466
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,380
All the brothers of Eagle Division

467
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,500
will remember her.

468
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,540
I don't want her to be a hero.

469
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,620
I just hope

470
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,420
she can come back safely.

471
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
She will come back.

472
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,660
She likes Eagle Division so much.

473
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
She likes you so much.

474
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,900
No matter what, she will come back.

475
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,500
She's a bastard.

476
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,500
She never knows how to take care of herself.

477
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,580
She only knows how to be a gun.

478
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,540
Mu Jin.

479
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,900
I'm really scared.

480
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,540
Changge shouldn't die.

481
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,860
I believe her.

482
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,540
She will be fine.

483
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,780
Yes.

484
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,140
She will be fine.

485
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,580
Maybe our people

486
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,780
have found her

487
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
and brought her back.

488
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,020
Right?

489
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,940
Yes.

490
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Maybe she's in Eagle Division now.

491
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,780
I'll take you back.

492
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,380
If you didn't do it,

493
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,740
why would you be like this?

494
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,620
If you didn't do it,

495
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,340
why would Wana die?

496
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,580
I didn't mean that.

497
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,780
Forget it.

498
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,700
Any news?

499
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,820
So many people have been looking for her.

500
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,620
If they still didn't find her,

501
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,540
the biggest possibility

502
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,780
is that she's in Wolf Division's hands.

503
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,380
If so,

504
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,540
what's your plan?

505
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,140
How's Wana?

506
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,860
Don't worry, Your Highness.

507
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,260
Ketun's injury has been getting better.

508
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,620
He just took the medicine.

509
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,820
He's asleep.

510
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,540
Good.

511
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,380
You may leave.

512
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,540
Yes.

513
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,220
Rainbow Lake

514
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,060
It's you.

515
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,340
I didn't expect it to be like this.

516
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,860
Actually, I...

517
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,340
You killed my mother.

518
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,660
You shouldn't have mentioned her.

519
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,820
That was...

520
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,100
That was an accident.

521
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,020
Accident?

522
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,180
Your accident took away Luhana's life.

523
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
You killed her.

524
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
You killed her.

525
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,540
You killed her.

526
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
You killed her.

527
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
You killed her.

528
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,060
You killed her.

529
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,220
You killed her.

530
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Luhana.

531
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,860
Is winning and losing so important to you?

532
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
No.

533
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,860
That's because you've always been the winner.

534
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,380
Ashile, Luhana.

535
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,260
When will you understand?

536
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,340
Whether it's a subordinate or a close relative,

537
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,940
they're not just a form of honor.

538
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,620
They're the responsibility on our shoulders.

539
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,180
They're the future of the grassland.

540
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,940
Even now,

541
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,540
you're still fighting for hope

542
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,140
and winning over the laughable.

543
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Childish.

544
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,020
You've always been so childish since you were a child.

545
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,180
When my mother died,

546
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
no.

547
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,860
Even now, I'd rather break you into pieces.

548
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,900
But I won't do that.

549
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
Because killing you can't change anything.

550
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
If I kill you,

551
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,660
my mother won't come back.

552
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Do you understand?

553
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Yes.

554
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
Revenge.

555
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Killing.

556
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,420
It will only bring endless pain and struggle.

557
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,820
There's nothing left between us.

558
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,420
Let go of my Eagle Division's brothers.

559
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
Let go of Li Changge.

560
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,020
Do whatever you want.

561
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,340
I think you've got the wrong person.

562
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,100
I can let go of the Eagle Division.

563
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
It's in my hands.

564
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
What did you say?

565
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,020
The Wolf Division didn't catch him.

566
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,060
You're the one who's got the wrong person.

567
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Where did he go?

568
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
I don't know.

569
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,980
The grassland is in danger.

570
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,460
There are many people.

571
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
There are many snakes.

572
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,540
He escaped alone.

573
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,260
How many lives do you think he has?

574
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,100
I've been through so much with him.

575
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,860
He can't have died so easily.

576
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,540
Then go find him yourself.

577
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,540
緊急狀況

578
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
What happened,

579
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:01,580
اد

580
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,980
Do you want to go?

581
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,660
Let go of my登壁

582
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,700
I've checked it everywher.

583
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
Don't go there.

584
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Where is he.

585
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Did you find him?

586
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Yes.

587
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,380
Changge is not with him.

588
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,500
Can you believe what Shi'er said?

589
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,020
It's not a lie.

590
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,660
Then,

591
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,140
is Changge really dead?

592
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,180
No.

593
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,660
I believe

594
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,340
he won't die so easily.

595
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,700
Yes.

596
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,820
Changge won't die so easily.

597
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,220
Let's go find him.

598
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,580
We'll find him.

599
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,940
Go.

600
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,140
All right. All right. All right.

601
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,940
What did I say?

602
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,700
Don't be so stubborn.

603
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,380
But he won't die so easily.

604
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,540
Who are you?

605
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,380
Where am I?

606
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,300
Think about it.

607
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,060
I can't remember.

608
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,820
It's strange.

609
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,580
He didn't hurt his head.

610
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,780
How could it be like this?

611
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,140
It's not right.

612
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,780
All right.

613
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,220
You can't remember, right?

614
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,340
Let me tell you.

615
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,140
My name is Situ Langlang.

616
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,220
I'm a swordsman.

617
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,620
This man, Sun Zhenren,

618
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,780
is my creditor.

619
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,300
We traveled through

620
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,340
and saved you

621
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,580
from Ashile Buren

622
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,300
who was half dead.

623
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,740
My father

624
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,140
tried to save you

625
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,900
who was half dead again.

626
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,620
That's what he meant.

627
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,140
Don't say anything

628
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,020
about the grassland

629
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,940
and the unrepentant.

630
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,140
Our main character,

631
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,340
the old friend

632
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,820
who was half dead again,

633
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,380
is used to it.

634
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,260
Di Changge,

635
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,420
do you think you're that great?

636
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,700
Now that I'm dead,

637
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,740
you put yourself in it

638
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,140
and put me and Eagle Division in it.

639
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,260
This is the consequence of your self-sacrifice.

640
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,860
If it weren't for your stubbornness,

641
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,260
my father wouldn't have died.

642
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,860
Give me some space.

643
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,740
All right. All right.

644
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,980
All right.

645
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,060
I'm sorry, Sun.

646
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,740
I killed your father.

647
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,700
Tell Sher to come and see me.

648
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:13,980
Yes.

649
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,660
What did you say?

650
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,740
Who told you to inform Great Khan?

651
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,900
I won't report it

652
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,540
if something like this happens.

653
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Others will report it too.

654
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,660
I should do what I should do

655
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,340
to make Wolf Division free from the involvement.

656
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,860
But...

657
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,140
But Eagle is in Anna's tent.

658
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,700
What if Anna is involved?

659
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,780
It depends on what Great Khan

660
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,260
says in front of Great Khan.

661
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,020
Whatever you say is the truth.

662
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,980
Great Khan will believe you.

663
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,140
But Eagle died under my knife.

664
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,940
Why did you...

665
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
Why did you kill him?

666
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
He's just a female slave.

667
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,020
Just a slave?

668
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,260
I haven't seen Anna for years.

669
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
It was Eagle who secretly told me

670
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,460
that Anna and I had known each other.

671
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,060
She and I

672
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,220
are in love.

673
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,540
I used Eagle to force Ashile Sun.

674
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,340
I was too angry.

675
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,660
I regret it now.

676
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,700
Moreover,

677
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,740
Eagle is Ashile Sun's foster mother.

678
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,900
Why didn't you give her a favor?

679
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,180
Great Khan remembers her favor,

680
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,740
but forgets the sufferings

681
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,660
Kedun has suffered these years.

682
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,180
Is it tiring to keep it?

683
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,180
How did Great Khan treat Kedun?

684
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,780
Don't you know?

685
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,300
Only by controlling your power

686
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,740
can you reunite with Kedun

687
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,580
and make her live a hard life.

688
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,500
Ashile Sun

689
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,020
is the biggest obstacle

690
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,540
to your control of the grassland.

691
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,340
You show her mercy

692
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,340
because you have no feelings for Kedun.

693
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,780
You can't be shaken

694
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,620
by her words.

695
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,740
Report, Great Khan.

696
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,900
Great Khan summoned you to his tent.

697
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,180
Yes.

698
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,460
Shuhai.

699
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,460
I'm not good at controlling the grassland.

700
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,020
Please calm down, Shuhai.

701
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,340
But Luo Yi

702
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,700
has led the army to kill Qin.

703
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,780
Please come with me to check it out.

704
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,620
Go and summon all the elite soldiers

705
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,780
of the Wolf Clan.

706
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,940
The equipment is ready.

707
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,060
Come with me.

708
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,100
Shuhai, what are you...

709
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,660
Ashile Sun

710
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,740
dared to rescue General Tang

711
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,300
and shoot Kedun

712
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,260
when I was not here.

713
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,700
Such a heartless man

714
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,220
can't stay here anymore.

715
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,940
Shuhai.

716
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,540
Shengdi.

717
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,220
Is there something wrong?

718
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,660
発生了什么问题,师兄?

719
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,380
You'reCU70 auchin病宝 læ.

720
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,860
T sozialCum Denis.

721
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,140
Accio Shallim diesel.

722
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,260
You're Conradin.

723
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,500
In the morning and in the evening.

724
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Focus on the war.

725
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,140
Vladimir?

726
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,260
Ready to go to the war.

727
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,260
Isn't that right?

728
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,300
Nice.

729
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,260
Everyone has started to understand

730
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
that you care about your family.

731
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,780
It needed your love and support.

732
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,580
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,100
Have some food first.

734
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,660
You're so restless

735
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,820
and don't eat or drink.

736
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,380
You've not even come back

737
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,220
to ask for punishment.

738
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,820
You've already collapsed.

739
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,140
What's this?

740
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,980
These are the grasslands and water sources

741
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
I've checked before.

742
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,580
If...

743
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,420
If one day, Wang Ting gives up Eagle Division,

744
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,060
you'll move to these places

745
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,060
with everyone.

746
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,900
Sun,

747
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,500
don't think I don't know

748
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
what your plan is.

749
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,220
What if

750
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,980
you're not the Eagle Division anymore?

751
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,740
Are you going to

752
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,420
settle everything here

753
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,780
and leave here?

754
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,700
Are you?

755
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:53,980
I'm busy.

756
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,620
You can leave now.

757
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,500
I'm not going out.

758
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,100
You're going to

759
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,180
take on everything alone again.

760
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,580
What do you think of me?

761
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,660
What do you think of

762
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,420
all the Eagle Division brothers?

763
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,940
Taqin.

764
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,380
What's up?

765
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,700
The Marquis just reported that

766
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,940
Wang Ting's men suddenly came.

767
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,580
It's the flag of Great Khan and Wolf Division.

768
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,780
They're coming soon.

769
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,940
It seems that they're not going to

770
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,060
give me a chance to explain.

771
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,660
Sun,

772
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,140
do you want to

773
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,420
gather all the cavalry?

774
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,140
No.

775
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,900
The war will only make the Eagle Division

776
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,780
suffer a heavy loss.

777
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,780
I want to protect

778
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,620
all of you.

779
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,340
Mu Jin,

780
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,420
remember,

781
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,580
no matter what you see

782
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,580
or hear later,

783
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,100
don't act rashly.

784
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,740
Everything is under my command.

785
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,540
Besides,

786
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,300
be prepared to welcome

787
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,140
the new special forces.

788
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,060
In Eagle Division,

789
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,620
I only recognize Ashile Sun.

790
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,780
Everyone in Eagle Division

791
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,340
only recognizes

792
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,020
Ashile Sun.

793
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,660
This is an order.

794
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,300
Taqin.

795
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,300
I heard the sound.

796
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,620
Get up by yourselves.

797
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,260
My father has been through it often.

798
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
Please think about his past,

799
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,140
we haven't done anything good for the Eagle Division.

800
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,060
Get up first,

801
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,940
go inside the battle tent.

802
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,780
In the cave,

803
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:26,500
there are combined

804
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,580
двух ga stringchips

805
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:33,980
twy

806
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,260
Father is communist

807
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,380
Are you buddha

808
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:37,420
I am buddha

809
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,580
is buddha

810
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,980
I'm sorry.

811
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,620
Sun,

812
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,940
sorry for the inconvenience.

813
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,540
I received a letter three days after the hunt.

814
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,780
It said that Eagle Division took over Luo Yi's escape.

815
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,540
They also fought with Wolf Division

816
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,900
and shot Khatun.

817
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,260
Father was so angry when he heard this

818
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,260
that he wanted to kill you personally.

819
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,060
But Sher told me

820
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,460
the whole story.

821
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,780
You two

822
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,940
were supposed to be hunting Luo Yi

823
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,300
for a good cause.

824
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
But you made such a grudge

825
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,700
for the sake of the credit.

826
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,060
Sun,

827
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,580
I know

828
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,940
you didn't mean to shoot Khatun.

829
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
Anyway,

830
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,660
A'Yi

831
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,860
died under Sher's knife.

832
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,620
It's wrong.

833
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,220
Sher,

834
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,220
apologize to Sun.

835
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm sorry.

836
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,620
I shot Khatun.

837
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,100
I'll take the punishment.

838
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,220
Sun, why?

839
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,940
It's not your fault.

840
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,060
I'll support you.

841
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,740
Thank you, father.

842
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,140
Sun, get up.

843
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,140
I brought a lot of materials

844
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,380
and weapons from the Imperial Court.

845
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,500
I gave them to Eagle Division.

846
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
I know

847
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,940
it's not enough to make up for my son.

848
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,420
But now,

849
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,620
he can't come back to life.

850
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
This time,

851
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,420
I brought a big sorcerer.

852
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,060
I want him

853
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,300
to pray for A'Yi.

854
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,460
I'll also

855
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,500
pray for A'Yi.

856
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,300
Sun,

857
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,380
if you want anything else,

858
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,540
just tell me.

859
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,100
Your mother is gone.

860
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,980
But your father

861
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,820
is always here.

862
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Sun, I have one thing

863
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,540
to ask you to promise me.

864
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,540
What is it?

865
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,820
I'll promise you everything.

866
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,940
My father

867
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,100
wanted to go to a place

868
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,020
with a wider view.

869
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,660
But he didn't have a chance

870
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,780
for so many years.

871
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,780
Now that my father is gone,

872
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,780
I want to fulfill his wish

873
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,860
and go to the world of the Great Qian.

874
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,260
If you have

875
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,380
a suitable candidate to take over Eagle Division,

876
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,780
please take good care of Eagle Division.

877
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,620
I'm sorry.

878
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,500
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm sorry.

880
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I'm sorry.

881
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm sorry.

882
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm sorry.

883
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm sorry.

884
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm sorry.

885
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm sorry.

886
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm sorry.

887
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I'm sorry.

888
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm sorry.

889
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm sorry.

890
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,420
I'm sorry.

891
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm sorry.

892
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I'm sorry.

893
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm sorry.

894
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
I'm sorry.

895
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm sorry.

896
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm sorry.

897
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm sorry.

898
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm sorry.

899
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm sorry.

900
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,420
I'm sorry.

907
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I'm sorry.

908
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,420
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

913
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I'm sorry.

914
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
I'm sorry.

915
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm sorry.

916
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,420
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,420
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420

I'm sorry.

943
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,420
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420

952
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,420
I'm sorry.

953
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,420
