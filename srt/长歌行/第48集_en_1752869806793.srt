1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will sing a song of longing

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will sing a song of longing

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, it's really him

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then, I must have wrongly blamed him

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yicheng has been threatening Mimi

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He didn't give up

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Instead, he has been helping us

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mimi, no matter what happens

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will believe you

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you willing to believe me?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mimi, tell me what happened

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Changge, you fool, you still care about me

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's wrong?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He wanted me to be at the meeting

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He wanted me to hurt you and frame you at the meeting

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He even wanted me to be honest in front of everyone

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are Li Jiancheng's daughter

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What should I do?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do as he said

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Although I have been concerned about Tang Huang

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't doubt his ability to handle things

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Even if my identity is exposed

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He can completely resolve this

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
As the family matter of Wei and Tang

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And there is Zhenzhu

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He is the real princess of Monan

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is not a fatal point

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
On the contrary, if you can do this

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not only can you save Bu Zhen and Mu Ji

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can also make him trust you more

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You mean I...

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Of course, if this makes you embarrassed

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You don't have to go

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, I am willing to find out the news for you

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mimi is really too brave

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But can he really send the information?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I believe he can

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Someone asked me to send you a band

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will send it to you

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you have any wishes before you die?

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I buried me in the grassland after I died

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to see the grassland recover and peace away from war

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then let you be there

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Be a lonely ghost

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's almost ready to start

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will wait for you

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will wait for you

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I will wait for you

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will wait for you

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Execute

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sun is in the hall

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Can you believe her words?

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you have any other choice besides believing me?

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I am standing in front of you

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Xu Feng

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Send a message to Master and Wei Shuyu

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Tell them the plan has changed

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Stop

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Changge

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Nonsense

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Li Changge

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let my people go

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let Ashile Sun go

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me go

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me go

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let me go

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Otherwise today

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
will be your son's death day

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Even if I let him go

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you think you can leave here alive?

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Protect the master

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Who said I came alone?

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't blame me for not reminding you

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you dare to move again

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know whose head is next

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Changge sent a message

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He will kidnap Sheng'er before the ceremony

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let Ashile Sun go

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
All guards will be led there

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We take the opportunity to go forward

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Divide into two ways

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go to find Gu Zhen and Mingming

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Go to save the late ancestors

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Bring them all out

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yicheng has no more strength

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Can't turn the sky

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Whether he and Ashile Sun can survive

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Make them live

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Greetings, Xiao Hao

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We are here to pick you up

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't be afraid, little boy

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I am here to save you

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Even if I die here today

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
My people can still kill the little Khan

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We fight with each other

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let Sheng'er go

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I let Ashile Sun go

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now it's up to me

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't forget

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your son is now in my hands

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't move

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you dare to hurt my son

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't spare you

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm fine

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let Ashile Sun go

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let Ashile Sun go

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let him go

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let Sheng'er go

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Go down

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Kill them

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stop

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sheng'er

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What do you want

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Anna

127
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let them go

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You dare to take the knife

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Against your Anna

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let them go

131
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Little Khan

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't hurt the princess

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You are my son

134
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You won't kill me

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Lin Meng, chase

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't move

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I won't kill you

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I will make you lose me

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You said all this is for me

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Now

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now there is no need

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So just now

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's you and Li Changge

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
A bitter journey

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I know I won't hurt you

146
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So you use me

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He is really my good son

148
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He is so brave

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why don't you kill me

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So you can save Ashile Sun

151
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And revenge for your Anna

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Kill me

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Kill me

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Anna

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Anna

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You have to have a heart

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can go at any time

159
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Lin Meng

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Chase them

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Kill them

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Go

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Go

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Changge

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Changge

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Here

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Go

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Go

170
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It seems to have some entrances and exits with the map

171
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You hear clearly

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Go out from here later

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There will be a door when you go forward

174
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I have already opened the door

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
As long as you can break in later

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But there may be some guards at the door

177
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But as long as you break out

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You can escape

179
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What about you

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't go

182
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I am your brother

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And you can rest assured

184
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
With my master Situ Lang Lang

185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Even the gods can't beat him

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Really

187
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Of course it's true

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why should I lie to you

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hurry up and go

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Go

191
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Catch them

192
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes

193
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Go

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Ming Yu

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Changge

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Fortunately, you are fine

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You will be fine too

198
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I take you out

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You will be fine too

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Go

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Bu Zhen

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Bu Zhen

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Little Master

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Xiao Hou's ancestors and Bu Zhen

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Have left

206
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Good

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Good

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Help me take good care of Bu Zhen

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We agreed to leave together

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I will take you and Bu Zhen

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Back to the Eagle Division together

212
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can definitely get you out

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can definitely get you out

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Changge

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I really

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I really want to see him again

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Kill

219
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Kill

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why are you back

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I came back to help my brother

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Cloud

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Mi Mi

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm coming

225
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
Is it really you?

226
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,200
It's me.

227
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,680
Promise me.

228
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,520
Promise me.

229
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
Take care of Bu Zhen.

230
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,240
We'll take care of Bu Zhen together.

231
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,600
We'll take him to the market.

232
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
We'll take him to the music troupe together.

233
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,120
There are many things to do.

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
I can't take care of him alone.

235
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
You can take care of him alone.

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,960
I want...

237
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
I want to eat candy.

238
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll take you to buy candy.

239
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
I'll buy you a lot of candy.

240
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,720
Okay?

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,040
Tian Tian.

242
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
I...

243
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,280
I like you.

244
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
Mimi.

245
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,360
I like you too.

246
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,400
I like you very much.

247
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
I like you very much

248
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,640
since I first met you.

249
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,240
I beg you not to let me go.

250
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,800
Tian Tian.

251
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Don't let me go.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Who are you saying is not capable?

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
You... You... You are you.

254
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,720
Mimi.

255
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,680
You are always Ying Shi's family.

256
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
It's my secret.

257
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,080
You are my man.

258
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
You have to take responsibility for me.

259
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
I'll take you back to the prairie, okay?

260
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,480
We can go to the desert.

261
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
We can go home.

262
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,520
Go home.

263
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,120
I'll take care of him alone.

264
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,240
Take care of him.

265
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,360
Take care of him.

266
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,800
Mimi.

267
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,840
Mimi.

268
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,920
Mimi.

269
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,200
Mimi.

270
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,920
Don't leave me, Mimi.

271
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Don't leave me, Bi Bi.

272
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Bi Bi.

273
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Bi Bi.

274
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Bi Bi.

275
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Bi Bi.

276
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Shou.

277
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Mi Mi.

278
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Mi Mi.

279
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Mi Mi.

280
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Mi Mi.

281
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Don't touch her.

282
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Why would this happen?

283
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Why?

284
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Why?

285
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Why don't you protect her?

286
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
And you.

287
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Everything you did was for you.

288
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Why don't you protect her?

289
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Why?

290
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,920
You should ask your mother.

291
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Sher.

292
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
It was Lei Meng who killed her.

293
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Lei Meng.

294
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Sher.

295
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Calm down.

296
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Get away.

297
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Li Jingjing's troops are being targeted.

298
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Li City will never be a place of peace.

299
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Come with us.

300
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Let go.

301
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Even if I help you,

302
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
it doesn't mean I'll surrender.

303
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
I don't care what you do.

304
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Whatever I do,

305
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
you'd better not care.

306
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Sher.

307
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Eagle Division's cavalry is good at fighting.

308
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
They're good at defending their army.

309
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
They've escaped from the palace.

310
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
They're just making trouble.

311
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Don't panic.

312
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Report.

313
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Report.

314
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Ketu.

315
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Li Jingjing has been targeted.

316
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Don't talk nonsense.

317
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Li Jingjing's army is still on the way.

318
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
How could he be targeted overnight?

319
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
The one who attacked my division

320
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
wasn't Shi Wanbu's army.

321
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
It was...

322
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,920
It was Li Jingjing's three thousand cavalry.

323
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
The three thousand cavalry that I brought here.

324
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Where did you get these?

325
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
You're making trouble.

326
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
You're disturbing my morale.

327
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Don't leave.

328
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
If you dare to leave the palace,

329
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
I'll kill you.

330
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I'll kill you.

331
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Enough.

332
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
It's ridiculous.

333
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
It's ridiculous.

334
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Why did you fight?

335
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
For yourself?

336
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
For Ashile Tribe?

337
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Or for your Princess Yicheng?

338
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Sher.

339
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Isn't there enough blood on your hands?

340
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
For your so-called great master,

341
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
how many people do you want to sacrifice?

342
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Lin Mo.

343
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Drag Sher out.

344
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Guards.

345
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Drag Xiao Kehan out.

346
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Yes.

347
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Anna.

348
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Anna, stop.

349
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Anna.

350
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Princess.

351
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
You want to let Xiao Kehan

352
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
die?

353
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Pass my order.

354
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Tell the three armies

355
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
to wait outside the gate of the city.

356
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Protect the leaders.

357
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Leave the capital together.

358
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
I'll be led by the Thunder Alliance.

359
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Wait outside the palace.

360
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Yes.

361
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Go.

362
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
You're right.

363
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I never think about

364
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
going back to the Sui Dynasty.

365
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
I just want to use Ashile Tribe

366
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
to fight for me.

367
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
So I have to bear the burden

368
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
to protect Khatun.

369
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I have four great Khan.

370
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
I not only want my son

371
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
to be the king of the prairie,

372
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
but also make him

373
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
overthrow the Li Party

374
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
and rebuild the Sui Dynasty.

375
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
What a pity.

376
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
I lost to my son

377
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
in the end.

378
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Tell me.

379
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Is it ridiculous?

380
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Am I the most

381
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
failed mother in the world?

382
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
If you become a chicken

383
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
like this,

384
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I hope you

385
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
wouldn't have me.

386
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
I've been crying all my life.

387
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
But I finally got this.

388
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Without you,

389
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
it's good.

390
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
From now on,

391
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
I'm no longer your mother.

392
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
You're no longer my son.

393
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Mother.

394
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Shut up.

395
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Take Sheng'er away.

396
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Leave.

397
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Why are you still here?

398
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Where is the princess?

399
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Where is the Thunder League?

400
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
How dare you!

401
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I want you to lead

402
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Wolf Division, Jingrui,

403
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
and Dingxiang to send troops

404
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
to escort Shi'er from Udua Valley.

405
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I have the leaders

406
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
and the people to cover me.

407
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I'll break through the white path.

408
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
You want to lead the enemy

409
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
and let the Khan live?

410
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Go now.

411
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
I'll follow you to the end of my life.

412
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
I'll follow you to the end of my life.

413
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll follow you to the end of my life.

414
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
No matter where you are,

415
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
whether you win or lose,

416
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
or even live or die,

417
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
I want you to take Shi'er away

418
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
and protect her from the grasslands

419
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
until she's safe.

420
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,920
I can't do it this time.

421
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Even you are going to betray me?

422
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
I dare not.

423
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
I just want to protect the princess

424
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
until the last moment.

425
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm the one who

426
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
escorted the princess to leave the Sui State.

427
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
I traveled thousands of miles to the grasslands.

428
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
It's been 30 years.

429
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Let me protect the princess.

430
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Okay?

431
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Go.

432
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Take Shi'er away.

433
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,520
and protect him with my life.

434
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
Can you do that?

435
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
Promise me.

436
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,680
Okay.

437
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Go now.

438
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,120
As soon as possible.

439
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Second princess.

440
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,860
veget久两

441
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,620
Why are you still staying?

442
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,820
I'm not leaving.

443
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,920
it's no time for you to be done.

444
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,720
Remember, stay alive.

445
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,240
Only by this

446
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,840
can you be able to face the princess.

447
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,760
Where's my Anna?

448
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,600
I know she's your Anna.

449
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,160
It's too late.

450
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,440
Take her away.

451
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,000
How dare you!

452
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,600
Ke Han,

453
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,000
please.

454
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,160
I'm going to find my Anna.

455
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,800
Stop pretending in front of me.

456
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,920
Can I trust you?

457
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,760
The princess's plan is ruined.

458
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,400
If you're not the princess's son,

459
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,680
I'll kill you.

460
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,960
Take her away.

461
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,720
Let me go.

462
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,480
Anna.

463
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,960
Go.

464
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,720
Let me go.

465
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,920
Anna.

466
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,240
Let's go.

467
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,600
Go.

468
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,520
Brother Qian,

469
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,720
it seems that Dingxiang Palace

470
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,080
has been successfully attacked by you.

471
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,920
Brother Lin,

472
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,720
where's my father?

473
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,640
Follow me.

474
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,160
Father.

475
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
Father.

476
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,120
How's he?

477
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,360
General Wu,

478
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,320
poison has been insert in five Messages.

479
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,400
cagey,

480
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,720
but he can't çok sakang

481
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,640
and withstand until now.

482
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,440
Lets him Knight

483
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,920
and try to fight in the Legion.

484
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,100
Is it impossible to

485
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,680
remove the poison?

486
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,120
It's easy,

487
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,000
but it takes time.

488
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,760
I can recover my speech

489
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
and my actions.

490
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
Father.

491
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
A'Da.

492
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,240
Sun Yang, for the rest of your life...

493
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,200
A'Da.

494
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,600
Wu Er.

495
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,840
A'Da.

496
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,160
I've asked Eagle Division to help Tang Army

497
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,360
to take Dingxiang.

498
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,400
The city has been using Ashile Tribe to fight.

499
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,760
I don't know how many people have died in the prairie.

500
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,920
If we want to take Dingxiang,

501
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,840
we have to unite the Tang Army.

502
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,920
The prairie has been fighting for years.

503
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,920
The blood flows into the river.

504
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,120
The people are dying.

505
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,280
The people are too tired.

506
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,240
Let them have a good rest

507
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,000
and return the peace to the world.

508
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,320
Okay?

509
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,920
A'Da.

510
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,640
We have to stop the war.

511
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,680
Are you sad?

512
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,360
No?

513
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
Are you sorry?

514
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,280
No.

515
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm not.

516
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Wait for a while.

517
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,360
I won't eat.

518
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,640
Let's go.

519
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,200
Let's go.

520
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
You like candy, right?

521
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
I'll bring you some candy.

522
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
You eat the candy.

523
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Eat the candy.

524
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Eat the candy.

525
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,640
It's really sweet.

526
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
So sweet.

527
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
I promised you

528
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
I'll buy you candy in the future.

529
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I promised you

530
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
I will do it.

531
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Wait until everything is settled

532
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
I can be with you.

533
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Everyone is here.

534
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Little boy.

535
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
You are so kind.

536
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
General, you want to see me?

537
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
You have done a good job.

538
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
This mission is important.

539
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
You should set out as soon as possible.

540
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
You are right.

541
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
18, Xu Feng

542
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
Since General Li is here

543
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Then you can go with Wei Shuyu

544
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
to escort the grandfather and grandson.

545
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
This is very important.

546
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Don't make any mistakes.

547
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
Yes.

548
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
What about the escort?

549
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
The escort?

550
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Don't ask me.

551
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Where do you want to go?

552
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
18 chess pieces of Yan Yun recognize the master.

553
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
They will never leave.

554
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Leave the identity of 18 chess pieces.

555
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
You should ask yourself.

556
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Where do you want to go?

557
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
I will listen to the master.

558
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Ok.

559
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I will order you to tell me the answer now.

560
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I don't know.

561
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Little boy.

562
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Don't make it difficult for 18.

563
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
I want to make it difficult for him.

564
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
He always follows me.

565
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
18, tell me the answer now.

566
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I want to try to live a free life.

567
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
With my friends.

568
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Friends.

569
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Ok.

570
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
I will go now.

571
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
I am here to save the son-in-law of the land.

572
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I have finished my task.

573
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I will go now.

574
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
I have to call my second disciple.

575
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
Second disciple?

576
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
You are so smart.

577
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I forgot to tell you.

578
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
I have a little disciple.

579
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
You have a little sister.

580
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Last time we went to find the grass.

581
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,640
The young hero Situ was at home with Yuanniang.

582
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I didn't expect that Yuanniang and Guqi were

583
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
a good dancer.

584
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,640
So Yuanniang was cheated and worshiped her as her master.

585
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
Even the children were cheated?

586
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,640
What are you talking about?

587
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
How can I be cheated?

588
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Yuanniang likes it very much.

589
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
She likes it very much.

590
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,640
You are my first disciple.

591
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I should give you the Qinghong Sword.

592
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,640
But your master

593
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,640
told me a thousand times

594
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
not to break the tradition of the Yue Nu Sword.

595
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
I am under a lot of pressure.

596
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,640
I know you will have no time to practice swordplay.

597
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
So I give you the sword.

598
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Don't be rude to me.

599
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Actually, I should thank you

600
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
for taking care of Yuanniang for me.

601
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,640
I hope she can be safe in her life.

602
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
It's a great honor for us.

603
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Don't worry.

604
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
I and Sun will take time

605
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
to visit you with Yuanniang.

606
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
See you.

607
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
We will meet again.

608
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Changge, what about me?

609
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Zhenzhu, the war is coming.

610
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
I am afraid I can't take care of you.

611
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I will send someone to send you back to Monan.

612
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
Thank you.

613
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Thank you, Atai.

614
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Changge, are you leaving me?

615
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
No.

616
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
You haven't been home for a long time.

617
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Your Atai must miss you.

618
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,640
I will go to see you with your Sun.

619
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Sun, you must come.

620
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,640
Your heart is like a mystery.

621
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Before saying goodbye,

622
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I expect...

623
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,640
I want to remember your voice.

624
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,640
It's locked in my tender dream.

625
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Before dawn,

626
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,640
my longing flows.

627
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,640
There is always a moment

628
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,640
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

629
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,640
There is always a longing

630
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,640
that unites us.

631
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,640
In different worlds,

632
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
in different worlds,

633
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I miss you.

634
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I long for you.

635
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
It's like the butterfly

636
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
turns into a eternal night.

637
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,640
The cocoon of the sky.

638
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,640
There is always a moment

639
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,640
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

640
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,640
There is always a longing

641
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,640
that unites us.

642
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
In different worlds,

643
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
in different worlds,

644
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,640
I miss you.

645
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,640
I long for you.

646
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,640
It's like the butterfly

647
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,640
turns into a eternal night.

648
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,640
The cocoon of the sky.

649
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
The cocoon.

650
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,640
The cocoon.
