1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is broken

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Look at the future

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is the look of my stubbornness

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life, the crazy of hope

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Legend of Chusen

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Uncle, are you okay?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Water

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Water?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The Legend of Chusen

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Done

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Stop

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You killed Lord Lu Jiang?

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Lord Lu Jiang Li Yuan

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He is a rebel

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He has been killed by me

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You killed Chusheng?

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The military situation is the fate of Lord Lu Jiang

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He is a rebel

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He is really helpless

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now he is a rebel

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I hope I can atone for my crime

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Where is Shuyu?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The envoy was hurt by Lord Lu Jiang

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I order people to settle down

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He is in the room

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He is in a critical condition

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The envoy

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
General Shen

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have a credit to the court

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Do you know who the person who left just now is?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She is the daughter of the rebel Li Jiancheng

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take down the Royal Army's warehouse

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Lord Lu Jiang is a rebel

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The people of the royal mansion will take him away

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait for interrogation

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shen Gu

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I am kind to you

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I didn't expect you are not a rebel

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Shut up

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I won't let you go

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Changge

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why are you here?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's good that you are fine

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I am waiting for you in the station

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know why

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The Royal Army released me suddenly

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They found a doctor for me

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hao Du set a fire

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I called the general who was guarding the city

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
with your identity

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The Royal Army saw that it was not good

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They asked for help

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What?

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have done what I should do

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Take good care of Leyan

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I must send him back safely

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Changge

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You have the Crown Prince's wedding day

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hao Du will

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He is not Li Shenglin

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just took away

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
something that belongs to me

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Master, how is it?

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We must be strict

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I am here to arrest the rebels

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
under the order of the Crown Prince's left son

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I am Shen Gu, the general of Youzhou

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The envoy of the Wei State has come to inform us

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We are handling the matter

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The envoy of the Wei State

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If the envoy of the Wei State didn't arrive in time

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I am afraid that the consequences will be unimaginable

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a pity that

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Lord Lujiang has been killed by Wang Junkuo

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He can't get the first word

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Master

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The person who kidnapped you from the court has come again

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come here

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wait

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I am here

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I am here

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I am here

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am here

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I am here

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am here

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How are you going to deal with Wang Junkuo?

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will inform the court

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and follow your order

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
During the period of Wen Tuo

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have locked this person in my camp

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wang Junkuo is cunning

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and has many men

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He will not escape

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Please

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Where did you come from?

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why did you arrest me?

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why are you a child?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Who are you?

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why are you pushing me?

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am a great official

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I am going to the camp at night to help the soldiers

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't forget to tell the court about this

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I am still waiting for the reward

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am taking the army of the judges

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to sweep the land of the evil and rebel

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Search

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Go

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Go

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where is Chengge?

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are asking me?

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am going to chase him back

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The thing is still with him

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's good that you know

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you can't find the thing

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You should go to the border with me

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Get up now

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will go to chase him back

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Your partner is still in the city

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it okay?

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I have made a promise to him

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will be a sign for the public

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He will come to me when he is free

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Thank you for saving my life

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't deserve your worship

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How do you know?

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Since I was a child

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have been trained by Xuntao

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's hard to learn from others

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the way of the palace

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It is said that

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Princess Yongning is still unknown

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I have served the Crown Prince

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can't guess your identity

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wang Junkuo just gave the princess to the court

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's more accurate than I thought

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If so

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
why don't you leave with me?

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now the whole Youzhou

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is in the hands of Li Shimin

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He won't let you go

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and follow my father's old steps

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Instead of waiting for the news

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
why don't you leave with me

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to wait for the future

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I am a commander

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can't do without orders

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Commandant Shen

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The whole Youzhou is under Du Ruhui's control

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Youzhou can't be saved

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a waste to stay here

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Besides

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the Crown Prince's blood is still with me

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Do you really think

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
a dead body can move thousands of troops?

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I help you

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to repay the love of the Crown Prince

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is my personal intention

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Although I am the old step of the Crown Prince

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I am the general of Tang

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now Ashile Tribe is moving in the north

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Youzhou is a major town in the north

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Millions of Li people

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
My duty is to protect

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the land of Youzhou

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you don't even understand this

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Princess

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it's useless to you

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
no matter what you hold

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Although I can't completely understand

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I am more intelligent

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Changge is taught

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Princess, let's go

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If we drag on

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will be in a hurry

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
when the soldiers come

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can't stay in Youzhou

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I have nowhere

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to go in this world

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Go to the northwest

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
To Shuozhou

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There is a valley outside

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It is a land between the Tang and the grasslands

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The court will not be in a hurry

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you, Shen Duowei

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Princess

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Take care of yourself

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Goodbye

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Go

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Go

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Go

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Go

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Go

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Go

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Go

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Go

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Little Khan, enough

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If we keep going, the horses will be tired

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Didn't you say that bastard has left?

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why did you run back?

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We can't just let it go

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I just noticed

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No traces of the army

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It must be that bastard who is the only one who is on the way

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Little Khan, what do you want to do?

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He dares to bite me

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why can't I bite him?

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You should immediately

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Go back to Khan

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Once you are on the road

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's too late

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Khan will inevitably have a new guess

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't tell me what to do

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What should I do?

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You really treat yourself as a bastard

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's the big Khan's guess?

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you want me to

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
?

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Khan

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He led the army to Shuozhou

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ying Shi should be in the north of Shuozhou now

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Walk this way

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We can guess that he is on this road

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ashile Sun should also be able to guess

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Correct

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Will they go to the south?

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Can you think of it?

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Can't he think of it?

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That bastard has always been a trickster

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He has been scheming

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He knows that I can guess that he is on this road

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But the order of the Great Khan is on his head

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If he walks this way

250
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He will be able to delay the military situation

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In order to complete the order of the Great Khan

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He never gave up on everything

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So he will definitely go to the north

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I feel that

255
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He will deliberately walk on the main road of the official road

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then we will go to the main road to pick him up

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We have to be quick

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Go to the small road to pick him up

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Why?

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Because I think he will walk on the main road of the official road

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He must have guessed that I would think so

262
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I bet he can also think of it this time

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Go

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Commandant Shen

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you going to cover up the criminal in the court?

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Criminal?

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Where is the criminal?

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The criminal Wang Junkuo is already in our prison

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But you two

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You are just a piece of fish

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
In this turbulent place

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can't trust you completely

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now, the Uyghur rebellion is under control

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We can't let any scouts escape from the city

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It seems that you won't let us go through anything today

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So what?

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You are the friend of Commandant Shen

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The two of us can't escape at the same time

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We can only sacrifice one

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have a higher skill than you

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You go first

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Be careful

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Jump

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Go

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Go

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Go

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Go

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Go

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I knew that the Wolf Division couldn't find you

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But when you thought you were hiding

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You must have appeared

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is a good move

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Not bad

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You have more courage to lose more and more

295
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Go

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Who told you to do it?

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
My duty is to protect you

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Not to watch you get beaten

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The ambush is very heavy

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
After being attacked

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's hard to catch up with him

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's go

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We must go back and report

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You guys keep chasing

306
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We can't let him go

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Go

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Go

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Changge

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Tell me

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Youzhou's losses are not big enough

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
How long are you going to escape?

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Changge

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I, Wei Shuyu, swear to God

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I will sacrifice everything for you

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Even if I can't get everything back

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I will die with you

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No matter it's the human world or the imperial power

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I will be with you until the end

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I won't believe anyone anymore

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I won't stand up for anyone either

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But the Crown Prince's blood is still on you

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
They won't go back one day

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They won't let you go one day

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I will let you go

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What Wei Shijun said is good

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But he just wants to get back the Crown Prince's blood

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You can do it

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Changge

330
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wei Shuyu

331
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Listen to me

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
From now on

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We have no connection with each other

334
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Since we know each other

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I will give you a big share

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Take it back and hand it over

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is just a dead body

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It can't shake people's hearts

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
From now on

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I will go on my own

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I will go on my own

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The Crown Prince's Blood

343
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Shen Guo

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You are the criminal

345
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I will go to Chang'an to report to the Crown Prince

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I will punish you

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please calm down

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The Commandant Shen said

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeming is not a spy

350
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He asked me to apologize for him

351
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
By the way

352
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
A Wei Shijun came here

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Please come this way

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Two

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Run

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
One

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Run

358
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please

359
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Two

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Run

361
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
One

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Run

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Two

364
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This time Li Changge ran away again

365
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The Crown Prince's blood has been found

366
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You and I can go back to Chang'an to report to the Commandant

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I not only want the Crown Prince's blood

368
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I also want Li Changge

369
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Wei Shuyu

370
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Where are you going?

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The Princess is still waiting in the station

372
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Good boy

373
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What is your name?

374
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Who are you?

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If my companion can't see me

376
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He will definitely come to me

377
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
By then you will be in trouble

378
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then don't let them come to me

379
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Child

380
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Being a person

381
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You have to be content

382
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
In case you lose even your life

383
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I ask you again

384
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What is your name?

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What is your name?

386
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Tell him

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
My name is Luo Yan

388
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Luo Yan

389
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's good that you understand

390
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You can call me Hai Lao

391
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
From now on

392
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You all be good

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I will find a good house for you

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Sell ​​a good price

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you don't listen

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You will sell to Caisheng Zhege

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was also kidnapped

398
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
These two people are taking pictures

399
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sell ​​flowers

400
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's for women and children to sell

401
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Sell ​​

402
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Where to sell?

403
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What does Caisheng Zhege mean?

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Just cut off your hands and feet

405
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Sell ​​to be a beggar

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Luo Yan

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We fell into this hell

408
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You have to help each other to survive

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Do you understand?

410
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Go

411
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Luo Yan

412
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Luo Yan

413
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Where is the princess?

414
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Where is the guest living in this room?

415
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know

416
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There has been no movement in this room

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
All valuable items are lost

418
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And there is no trace of fighting in this room

419
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The princess can't run away by herself

420
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There is only one possibility

421
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Was taken away by others

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Wei Shuyu

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Wei Shuyu

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You quickly pack up now

425
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Go back to Chang'an immediately

426
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Bring back the information about Youzhou and the missing princess

427
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Remember to bring back

428
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
No

429
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I want to find Luo Yan back

430
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I repeat the last time

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Your task now

432
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Is to send letters to Chang'an

433
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Luo Yan is missing

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What task are you talking about now?

435
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Youzhou is not familiar with the human body

436
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
To the north is the border of the ice and horse chaos

437
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Luo Yan's identity is noble, innocent, pure and kind

438
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Weak

439
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
He is lost in the folk

440
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The most urgent thing is to find him back

441
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Shut up, Wei Shuyu

442
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I ask you

443
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Who did the princess lose?

444
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Who made her go with the wind?

445
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Who praised the sea and said that the princess died

446
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And comforted her to take the burden

447
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I said I would take the burden

448
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I will take it to the end

449
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You can report to the upper level

450
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I, Wei Shuyu, am willing to take the risk

451
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I will definitely find the princess back

452
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If she has any problems

453
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I, Wei Shuyu, will die to atone for my sins

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Wei Shuyu

455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't forget what you did in Youzhou

456
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You find it fast alone

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or the crown prince sends someone to find it fast?

459
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Master left a mark

460
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Your Royal Highness

461
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The wolf's eye has been destroyed in the west

462
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Youzhou has been pacified

463
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Wei Shiyue is on the way back to the capital

464
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's good

465
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Your Royal Highness

466
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The Hebei Shandong area

467
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Is the old house of Li Jiancheng

468
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If they let go and continue to guard

469
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It will be a self-protection

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sooner or later, the father of the island will be returned to Youzhou

471
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What do you want?

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Hebei Zhu Zhen is under the order to guard

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
To prevent the bandits from the grassland

474
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Do you want to

475
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Take the military power in their hands

476
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And eliminate them?

477
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
If there is a better way for the Wei family

478
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I am willing to listen to it

479
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Don't forget

480
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The one who started Youzhou is the young man of the Wei family

481
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Lord Lujiang didn't follow him back to the capital

482
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Instead, he made a comeback

483
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The young man is really a genius

484
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Your Royal Highness

485
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I have no way to teach my son

486
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Please punish me

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
After he returns

488
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Except for the court punishment

489
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I have other family laws to deal with

490
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But the matter of Youzhou

491
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's about the overall situation

492
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I beg you

493
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Never suppress the armed forces

494
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
In case of panic

495
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I once followed Jiancheng to the Hebei city

496
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I am willing to be in Hebei again

497
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
To pacify Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji and the old house

498
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Mr. Wei

499
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
If you believe me

500
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I will leave for Beishang tomorrow morning

501
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I hope you can be patient and calm

502
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
To be at ease

503
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Good

504
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The Hebei city

505
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I will entrust it to you

506
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You have traveled a long way

507
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Just act in a casual way

508
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No need to be nervous

509
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Thank you, Your Royal Highness

510
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Come

511
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
If he doesn't return

512
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
No matter where he is

513
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I will eliminate him on behalf of the court

514
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Master Du is obstinate

515
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You deliberately take care of the troops

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And his son

517
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
to the north of the city for you.

518
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,120
So what?

519
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,040
Poor Wei Zheng.

520
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,680
He's just a worker.

521
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,440
He thought if he didn't go to work,

522
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,480
you would really ask for his life

523
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,640
and punish Zhu Jiang.

524
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,400
He finally got the job.

525
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,240
If he didn't go to work,

526
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,880
would he still have to

527
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,080
let him eat for free?

528
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,840
That's the reason.

529
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,780
I can't die just because of him.

530
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,420
But he Sí could afford it!

531
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,240
But these Thursday terrże

532
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,520
can be very lonely.

533
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,760
How can I go pants like a person like that?

534
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,880
Do you recognize me?

535
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,980
You know you'll get payed back for it that way.

536
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,820
12050, it's worth 1000.

537
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,320
Which one?

538
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Hey, check it out!

539
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Why do you always live in a broken room

540
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
instead of a woodshed?

541
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Why are you here?

542
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I should be the one asking you this.

543
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
You think everyone is like you?

544
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
A rich boss?

545
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Why are you hurt?

546
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
What are you doing?

547
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm wrapping the hairpin.

548
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Wrapping hairpin?

549
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Hurry up.

550
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
I'm sorry.

551
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
You can ask me anything.

552
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
I feel bad even if you hold me back.

553
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
How did you get hurt?

554
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
What happened to the horse?

555
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Why do you ask me this?

556
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
I'm asking you about the person.

557
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm asking you about the person.

558
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Yes.

559
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
I'm a grasslander from Ashile Tribe.

560
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
I don't deny it.

561
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
I don't deny it.

562
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
You know the person from Ashile Tribe?

563
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Did you get involved in the

564
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
collusion with Wang Junkuo

565
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,500
and steal the

566
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Youzhou's treasury?

567
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
I can only tell you that I was hurt by the person from Ashile Tribe.

568
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
As for the car that you can get the treasury,

569
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
I did it secretly.

570
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
It's really you?

571
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Who are you?

572
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
A'Zhuang.

573
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Since you don't want to say it,

574
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
I won't ask.

575
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I'll just treat you as a businesswoman.

576
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
I'll just treat you as a businesswoman.

577
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
But it's not my style to see you die.

578
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Where are you going after leaving Youzhou?

579
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Where are you going after leaving Youzhou?

580
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
You can't tell me.

581
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
There are only two ways

582
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
to go down from this road.

583
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Either go to Shuozhou

584
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
or go to the grassland.

585
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
You won't

586
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
go to the grassland, right?

587
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Don't go to Shuozhou.

588
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
How?

589
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
That's the border.

590
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
It's far from the Tang Dynasty.

591
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
And

592
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
for the past few years,

593
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
the war has been going on.

594
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
You'd better take care of yourself first.

595
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm serious.

596
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Hurry up and go.

597
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
It's not safe here.

598
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
If someone asks,

599
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
tell them you've never seen me.

600
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
You can handle it alone?

601
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Don't worry.

602
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm not that easy to die.

603
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Wait.

604
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Next time,

605
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
don't try to break the ground.

606
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
I won't be bothered by any trouble.

607
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I'll take it.

608
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
I'll wait for you to pay.

609
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Thank you, boss.

610
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
See you later,

611
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Shisi.

612
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
No.

613
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Princess Yongning.

614
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
It's good that you brought it back.

615
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
You're rewarded with a lot of money and a good teacher.

616
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

617
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
With Changge's personality,

618
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
she won't hand it over so easily.

619
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Changge is fine, right?

620
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
After Princess Yongning handed over the thing,

621
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
she escaped.

622
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Fine.

623
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Don't start a conflict again.

624
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Yongning's matter

625
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
is not a matter of the past.

626
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I'm not going to let you go.

627
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
I'm not going to let you go.

628
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm not going to let you go.

629
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Yongning's matter

630
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
ends here.

631
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
I have one more thing to report.

632
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Still Changge?

633
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
It's Princess Yongan.

634
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
What's wrong with Leyan?

635
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Princess Yongan

636
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
followed the team to Youzhou.

637
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
How did you expect Youzhou to change?

638
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Wei was detained by Wang Junkuo.

639
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Hao Du went to rescue her.

640
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Princess Yongan

641
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
was waiting at the post station.

642
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Who knew that after the wolf smoke was put out

643
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
and returned to the post station,

644
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Princess Yongan disappeared.

645
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Your Highness,

646
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I've asked people around

647
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
the county to secretly

648
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
find out Princess Yongan's whereabouts.

649
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Wei asked

650
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
to find Princess Yongan

651
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
in the form of a prisoner.

652
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Do you think

653
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
we should call her back to ask for punishment?

654
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Fine.

655
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
I believe

656
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
she will do her best

657
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
to find Yan'er.

658
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
You go on.

659
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Tell her that Princess Yongan is in a critical condition

660
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
and is still in Luoyang's palace.

661
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
She must not let go of her.

662
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Don't worry, Your Highness.

663
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
I will make sure everything is well arranged.

664
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Ke Ming,

665
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
you can leave now.

666
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I want to be alone.

667
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
I want to be alone.

668
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
I will take my leave.

669
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Yuan Yan,

670
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
your food fell.

671
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Pick it up.

672
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I'll eat it if you don't.

673
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Eat slowly.

674
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,340
I won't fight with you.

675
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
You're so nice to me.

676
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,620
We'll be good sisters from now on.

677
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,860
We'll share happiness and sorrow.

678
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,620
Sister Leyan, I'm a little thirsty.

679
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
I'll drink some of your water.

680
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Older brother Hai,

681
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,740
can you give me some more water?

682
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,860
I've given you all the food today.

683
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,100
You don't want it yourself.

684
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,500
Who do you want it for?

685
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
The Imperial Physician's Office

686
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Doctor Fang.

687
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Your Highness.

688
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,260
Any news about Leyan?

689
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,980
I've sent people to search for

690
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,260
the whereabouts of Princess Yongan in each county.

691
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,500
But

692
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,060
there's no news yet.

693
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,020
No news yet?

694
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,740
No one can speak of that.

695
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,740
You...

696
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
Yan,

697
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,060
you're teleporting to others

698
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,420
while being so frail.

699
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,140
I can't

700
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,580
believe I can't do anything.

701
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,580
Master.

702
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,820
Water.

703
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,140
Shuyu.

704
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,220
Leyan.

705
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,300
Shuyu.

706
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,660
Shuyu, you're here to save me.

707
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,860
Don't get my carriage dirty if you want to die.

708
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,140
Who is Shuyu?

709
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,420
Do you want to catch your Shuyu

710
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,980
and be your partner?

711
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,780
No.

712
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,020
Please don't hurt Shuyu.

713
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,580
You've been missing for days.

714
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,500
I haven't seen your Shuyu come to you.

715
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,100
I've been waiting for you.

716
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,980
How much do you want?

717
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,820
I can give you any amount you want.

718
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,460
Just let me go.

719
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,260
You can't let a rich lady go.

720
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,340
If I let you go,

721
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,140
your family will come to catch me.

722
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,940
No.

723
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,540
No.

724
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,220
I promise.

725
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,020
No.

726
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,740
Please, Hailang.

727
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,220
Please let me go.

728
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,820
It's time for me to rest.

729
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,220
If you keep fighting,

730
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,020
I'll cut off your tongue.

731
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,700
Gosh.

732
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,780
parameters

733
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,260
If you kill me,

734
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,460
please only punish the subordinates.

735
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,260
Just let me go.

736
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,620
Just let me go.

737
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,140
free

738
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,500
Ms. Song.

739
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,280
Stop, stop.

740
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Stop!

741
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Leyan, where are you?

742
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,300
Does he look like a celebrity when he is a lightweight red Doing功 sortie

743
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,660
Soul!!

744
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Whatever, I don't care

745
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,080
5 extra để

746
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,660
Oh he is cheering now

747
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,460
Shakespeare

748
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,540
غ lively

749
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,260
Two bags

750
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,300
Two bags

751
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,620
Sigh

752
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,700
They are sleeping

753
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,420
Children buy one

754
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,300
Xuezhou land Martinez

755
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,740
Has beenbars

756
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,340
And every year

757
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,580
Why still so busily

758
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
I'm Gongsun Hong of Shuozhou.

759
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,580
I'm not going to surrender to the bandits.

760
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
Gongsun Hong?

761
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
Have some.

762
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Have some.

763
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Thank you.

764
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,580
Here.

765
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Here.

766
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
Even in the most prosperous Chang'an,

767
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
Thank you.

768
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
there's no such harmonious scene.

769
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:08,580
Heart, gradually responds, gradually awakens,

770
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:18,580
Gradually swim towards you, before saying goodbye.

771
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,580
I'll remember your life,

772
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Locked in my longing dream.

773
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Before dawn,

774
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,580
Between the years,

775
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,580
The longing flows continuously.

776
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,580
There's always a moment,

777
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:47,580
That burns into the wastelands in my heart.

778
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,580
There's always a longing,

779
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,580
That unites us,

780
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,580
Everything.

781
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
In each other's world,

782
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,580
In different worlds,

783
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I'll always miss you.

784
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,580
The deep love,

785
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,580
Becomes eternity.

786
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:17,580
The cocoon of the night sky.

787
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,580
There's always a moment,

788
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:31,580
That burns into the wastelands in my heart.

789
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,580
There's always a longing,

790
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,580
That unites us,

791
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,580
Everything.

792
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,580
In each other's world,

793
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
In different worlds,

794
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,580
I'll always miss you.

795
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,580
The deep love,

796
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,580
Becomes eternity.

797
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:02,580
The cocoon of the night sky.

798
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
Unite us.

799
