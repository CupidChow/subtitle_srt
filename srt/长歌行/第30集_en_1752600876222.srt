1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will become the true me

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will be the hope in the dark night

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will be the light in the dark night

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Billets of Symbols

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think it's some guy who dares to break into the Liuyun Temple.

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,520
Kid, come out.

8
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,200
You are the first person who broke into the Liuyun Temple

9
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,920
without permission for a hundred years.

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,480
You're a man.

11
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,840
It's not good for you to break into the Taoist temple

12
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,200
where women are held.

13
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,720
I broke into the Taoist temple

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,120
for the sake of the Taoist temple.

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm here to find my old friend.

17
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,640
I've told you.

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,960
There's no one called Li Changge here.

19
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,360
And there's no one called Li Shisi here.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm Li Changge.

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,200
Thank you for your advice, Young Master Situ.

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Aren't you being too arrogant?

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,360
You want to come and leave as you please.

24
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
I told you.

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
I'm not causing trouble.

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm just here to find someone.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,520
You want to fight with me?

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
You think you can beat me?

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
You can try.

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,120
Stop it.

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,880
Taoist temple is a quiet place.

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
Don't disturb the Taoist.

33
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,800
Mr. Situ,

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,200
don't worry about him.

35
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,840
Just let him leave.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,320
Boring.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
I really want to find that old friend.

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
I was in a hurry.

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,960
So...

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,120
I've told you.

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
The woman that Ms. Sun saved is not important.

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
You'd better leave now.

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,760
Sorry to bother you.

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Sorry.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
My disciple, Li Changge,

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
is called Li Shisi again?

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,160
Such a normal name is not tiring.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
Now that I've come across the old friend.

50
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,760
Thanks.

51
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
선호

52
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Where are you?

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,400
Let's have a cup of tea.

54
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,920
Okay.

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
What would you like to drink?

56
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Tea, please.

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Okay, wait a moment.

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
They say that in three days,

59
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,520
Luoyang will be in a state of emergency.

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
They say that in three days,

61
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,320
Luoyang will be in a state of emergency.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
The weather is very hot now.

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
We don't even have enough water to drink.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,280
If we drink water,

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
how can we put out the fire?

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,640
What should we do?

67
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
What are you worried about?

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I heard that

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
the fire

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,000
won't burn us.

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
What do you mean?

72
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,400
Mr. Liu,

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,640
do you know something?

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,840
Tell me.

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
The drought and the fire

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,760
are always in the way of Luoyang.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Just wait and see.

78
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
In less than two days,

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
the heavens will tell us

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
who caused the disaster in Luoyang.

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,040
Li.

82
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,520
Have some tea.

83
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,120
Look at you.

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
Why are you so happy?

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,200
The tea hasn't been served yet.

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,360
Take your time.

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm leaving.

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,040
You haven't finished yet.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,760
You've just finished half of it.

90
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,720
I'll go buy something.

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Selling guns?

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
Come and have a look.

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
Why did you go away?

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
Why are you so informal

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,080
and 친구들?

96
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
Now everyone's working well together.

97
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,800
What are you doing?

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,360
Don't be insolent on state rules.

99
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
Its not bad for you to join them?

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,240
What should I do?

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Do you want to getЯ

102
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,680
to stop Questions to Liables and Biosec⁣

103
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,360
Mr. Wang,

104
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
please step away.

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
What are you trying to do?

106
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,720
You should do it.

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
No, I won't.

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,240
Say something. What's wrong?

109
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,280
I went to the Liuying Temple where the beast was kept.

110
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
There were too many women who were rescued by Sun Si Miao.

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,400
They were screaming.

112
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,880
I went in there to look for them.

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,440
If they were inside, they wouldn't have stayed there.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
I was wrong.

115
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
You haven't finished yet.

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
All right.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't worry.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,280
We will find Young Master.

119
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Xu Feng is right.

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,000
Before we start,

121
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
we should inform each other

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
in case of trouble.

123
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,160
Besides,

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Mr. Qin has a special identity.

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,840
We should be extra careful.

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
I think

127
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,000
we should take care of

128
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,640
finding Young Master.

129
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,480
I think

130
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
the split will bequa a massive team effort

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
to find Young Master in the truth.

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
At last you are back.

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm telling you.

134
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,280
Shortly after you left,

135
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,560
Someone is so arrogant.

136
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,280
By the way, Li.

137
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
He's also in your room.

138
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,960
Go and check

139
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,080
if there's anything missing.

140
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,960
It's okay.

141
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,400
I don't have anything to be worried about.

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,760
The drought and fire

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,320
are always in the way of Luoyang.

144
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,080
Just wait.

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
In two days,

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,440
the God will tell us

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,960
who caused the disaster in Luoyang.

148
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
The rumor about the disaster in Luoyang is not that simple.

149
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,840
Who is that person

150
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
who wants to point the peaches at?

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
Do you know

152
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,840
that the rumor has spread

153
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,400
that the disaster will be in Luoyang

154
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,600
in three days?

155
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,760
I'm sure you've heard

156
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,320
about the God.

157
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
But today,

158
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,560
I read a rumor

159
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,000
in the wine temple.

160
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,560
It said that the Crown Prince

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,800
was just having fun

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
before he showed up.

163
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,320
The Purple Tail Palace is still burning.

164
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm afraid it's the fire.

165
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,280
Do you think we can just wait?

166
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,360
There are many processes

167
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,840
but the scene is still vague.

168
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,000
Your Counter진짜 is only trying

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
to drive the runs.

170
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
Get up!

171
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,120
The final remained Aboriginal

172
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,760
in the knife hometown in Luoyang.

173
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,860
Here,

174
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,440
are some auspicious stones.

175
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,880
Yep.

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,720
Now just use it to strike place.

177
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,080
Brother,

178
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,920
They all had regret in my heart.

179
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,040
ask me for help

180
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm its weakness.

181
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,580
I'm its step-father.

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm just a mole.

183
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
P divisor to tableti

184
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,900
Drop into the memorial tower

185
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,160
seasoning

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,100
Then?

187
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,720
Your Highness.

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,520
Please wait.

189
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Minister Du.

190
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,520
The rumor this time

191
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,280
is just that

192
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,560
Luoyang will be in trouble.

193
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
But I always feel

194
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,920
that someone has connected

195
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
the news with the Crown Prince.

196
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,440
Your Highness.

197
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,280
We should look at each other

198
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,640
for three days.

199
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,640
You are right.

200
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
But please rest assured.

201
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
I will handle this matter well.

202
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
Thank you, Minister Du.

203
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Chun Feng,

204
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,180
can you tell the outsiders

205
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,160
that

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,520
the mistrust in Tian Xiang

207
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,600
is suspicious?

208
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Your Majesty.

209
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,200
I got the information

210
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:48,600
through land-laid

211
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,800
neighbors.

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll deal with him

213
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
when he comes back.

214
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
Do you know what Du Qing said in the letter?

215
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,560
He asked him to go to Luoyang to investigate the disaster.

216
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
But he

217
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,160
always hides in Ziwei Palace and mess around.

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,640
He doesn't look like a good man.

219
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,840
But it makes me happy.

220
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
Du Qing told me

221
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Yan'er has been in Luoyang

222
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,080
to deal with the problem of the disaster

223
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,200
of the tyrant.

224
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,960
It has already started

225
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,000
the ups and downs of our princess.

226
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Yan'er's changes

227
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,040
have seen its growth.

228
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,920
But the price of growth

229
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,800
is often difficult.

230
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,840
My daughter

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,080
really makes me

232
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,080
feel sad

233
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
and sad.

234
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,480
Your Highness,

235
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,040
you are so kind to the people.

236
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,120
It's a blessing for Tang.

237
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,720
The Crown Prince is still young.

238
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,800
I believe he will help you

239
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,720
when he is over.

240
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
I don't need to speak for him.

241
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,360
I should teach him a lesson.

242
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,200
Maybe he can wake up.

243
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:24,880
Green

244
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
So beautiful.

245
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,200
Great.

246
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,400
Green

247
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Okay, okay.

248
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,580
Okay.

249
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,500
Okay!

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Keep strength!

251
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,680
But after you go back,

252
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,960
you must not touch the dirty water.

253
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,400
Understand?

254
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay, go over there and get some dirt.

255
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Thank you.

256
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
Don't touch the water these days.

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,360
Okay.

258
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360
Why are you here?

259
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm worried about you.

260
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
Just in case,

261
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,840
you'd better hide from the public.

262
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,000
Minister Du and Hao Du are in Luoyang now.

263
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,040
If...

264
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay, go to the pharmacy.

265
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,200
Thank you.

266
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,400
Thank you.

267
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,560
Didn't you say that His Majesty wouldn't kill me?

268
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,280
His Majesty is a great emperor.

269
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,600
He doesn't care about it anymore.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
But you're afraid that Du Ruhui will violate the imperial edict.

271
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,440
Wei Shuyu,

272
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
why are you still so weak and weak?

273
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
You've been through a lot.

274
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm not afraid of this anymore.

275
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,400
I'm not weak and weak.

276
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,280
I really don't dare to let you take any risks.

277
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
You're not afraid of death.

278
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,280
But I'm afraid of you.

279
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,760
It's time for Liuyun Temple to be busy.

280
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
I can't leave.

281
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,360
And I won't leave.

282
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,160
Let me help you.

283
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,160
Thank you.

284
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
The Taoist Temple

285
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Your father never believed in the Buddha.

286
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,360
Why are you here today?

287
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,400
It's not that I don't believe it.

288
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
I just don't believe it.

289
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
The day before Chang'an was set up,

290
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,280
Li Chunfeng,

291
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,560
who is your son,

292
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,400
gave me a Jin Nang.

293
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,960
He asked me to come here after I arrived in Luoyang.

294
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,360
Hurry up.

295
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,080
I'm afraid that you will be in the dark

296
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
and cold for three years.

297
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
I'm afraid that you won't last for a year

298
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,240
and you will end up in a oil-painted lighthouse.

299
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,360
I know it.

300
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
I've calculated it for you.

301
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
It's a bit strange.

302
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,760
Take this Jin Nang

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
and open it in Luoyang.

304
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,600
Go here

305
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,280
on the first day of the seventh month.

306
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,520
Maybe

307
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
there is a chance.

308
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,720
This God-given word

309
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,320
has always been different.

310
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
Since we are in Luoyang,

311
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,320
why don't we come here?

312
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,600
Your Highness.

313
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,160
You two don't seem to be here

314
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
to ask for a diagnosis from Immortal Sun.

315
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,920
What can I do for you?

316
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,240
Immortal Sun?

317
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,640
Is it that

318
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,720
Sun Si Miao, the Immortal Sun?

319
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,840
Of course.

320
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,840
Is there any other Immortal Sun

321
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,520
who can treat so many people?

322
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,720
I asked the doctor to come here

323
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,760
to ask Immortal Sun to give a face-to-face diagnosis.

324
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,400
OK.

325
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,040
Please tell the doctor

326
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
that the Minister of War, Du Ru Hui,

327
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,000
wants to see Immortal Sun.

328
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
You can see him whenever you want.

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
How can I know if he is real or not?

330
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,000
Yesterday, someone came to make trouble in Liuyun Temple.

331
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,800
Now, there are all kinds of people.

332
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,760
Look carefully.

333
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,640
Anyway,

334
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
I don't know what it is.

335
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,120
But

336
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
no matter you are the minister or the subordinate,

337
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,680
the rules of Liuyun Temple

338
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,000
are to come first and then arrive.

339
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,280
Please line up in the temple.

340
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,320
OK.

341
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,120
Changge,

342
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,880
it's about your safety.

343
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,720
We really can't be careless.

344
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
Second Master.

345
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Yes.

346
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,560
Go to the pharmacy

347
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
and get ten acupuncture points.

348
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,160
Yes.

349
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Wait for me.

350
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Immortal Sun,

351
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,200
there are two people with the same face.

352
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
It seems that some minister

353
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,920
wants to see you.

354
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,000
What minister?

355
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,560
Tell them to line up outside.

356
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes.

357
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,160
Please line up here.

358
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,920
Thank you.

359
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,400
What?

360
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Wen Shuyu, you...

361
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
What are you looking at?

362
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,000
Godfather,

363
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,400
I seem to see an old friend.

364
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I'll be right back.

365
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,880
OK.

366
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,400
Are you interested in the pharmacy

367
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,320
in the temple?

368
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
No, I'm not.

369
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,680
I am just looking there

370
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,440
if someone sneaked into the pharmacy.

371
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Sneaked?

372
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
Liuyun Temple is successful

373
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,960
and promotes calligraphy.

374
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
How could it be a snagger?

375
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
This is Minister Du, right?

376
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,840
Minster.

377
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,040
I இர narrator

378
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,400
of a ostatst

379
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,480
This young man

380
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
entered my Liuyun Temple

381
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,520
and went to my pharmacy.

382
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,320
I wonder if there's

383
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,160
any problem with my pharmacy.

384
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
Now there are many people in Luoyang

385
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,480
and many people are in trouble.

386
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,520
Hao Du is worried that

387
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,800
people who are not good-hearted

388
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
will take the opportunity to protect

389
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,240
and disturb the Taoist priest and the real person.

390
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,560
Thank you for your concern.

391
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,360
It's just that Liuyun Temple is always as clean as water.

392
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
Why do you care about it?

393
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,720
I'm afraid you misjudged it.

394
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,040
Yes.

395
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,600
Why is Du Ruhui here?

396
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,760
Changge, it's too dangerous here.

397
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,200
You'd better leave with me first.

398
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,920
Leave with you?

399
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,400
What will happen after that?

400
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
I'll think of a way.

401
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,360
Changge,

402
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,440
I really want to protect you.

403
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,480
Can you

404
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,640
trust me for the last time?

405
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,200
I don't want to trust you.

406
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,800
But now

407
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,560
if I can think of another way,

408
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,360
I won't hide here.

409
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,800
And

410
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,360
I haven't got the answer I want.

411
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
What answer?

412
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,240
Shuyu,

413
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
I think you should be busy

414
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,880
at the office in Luoyang.

415
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,840
You go first.

416
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,120
As for them,

417
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm not afraid.

418
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,560
But now I can't think of another way.

419
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,240
I'll think of another way.

420
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,640
Don't worry.

421
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,800
Changge.

422
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,680
Changge.

423
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,920
Even if

424
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,720
Chunfeng saw it,

425
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,440
I won't disturb him.

426
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,760
I'm afraid you

427
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,480
won't have many days left.

428
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,000
If you want to stay here for a few more days,

429
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,640
you have to retreat

430
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,800
and return to the mountains.

431
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,280
But I'm concerned about you.

432
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm afraid you won't let go

433
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,400
of your duty.

434
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,760
I can't let go

435
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,800
until today.

436
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,280
I dare not let go.

437
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,680
I don't want to let go.

438
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,680
If I can't

439
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,640
do anything for the real person,

440
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,120
it's okay.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
You're so worried.

442
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,280
With my power,

443
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,840
I'm afraid I can only

444
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,720
keep you for three years.

445
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,680
But I'm afraid

446
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,160
you'll have a hard time

447
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,200
when you die.

448
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,320
Three years is enough.

449
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Thank you.

450
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
Is it really worth it?

451
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,040
You two

452
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
took care of the poor in Liuyun Temple.

453
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
Have you ever thought about

454
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
why these poor people came here?

455
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,000
The world is cruel.

456
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,720
Everything is a fate.

457
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,560
It's just a fate.

458
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,120
The real person is a man of the world.

459
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,240
But there are thousands of people

460
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,960
who are evil for the red dust.

461
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,280
They can't escape.

462
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
They can only struggle for survival.

463
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,560
I read the Book of the Immortal and the Way of the Ten Dynasties.

464
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,400
I don't want to die.

465
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,520
His Majesty is trying to make a fortune.

466
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,320
I can't let His Majesty

467
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,600
go on this road alone.

468
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,360
Three years is enough.

469
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm willing to go for the bull and horse

470
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,760
to accompany His Majesty

471
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,920
to see if we can start

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
a prosperous and peaceful life.

473
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,640
Sister, what are you doing?

474
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,240
Minister Du said

475
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,600
the good day will come tomorrow.

476
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
His Highness needs to take people

477
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
to the White Horse Temple to pray.

478
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,480
Tomorrow?

479
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,600
What's wrong?

480
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,200
Nothing.

481
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,600
Brother,

482
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
from now on,

483
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,640
you can't play the child's temper anymore.

484
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,320
Father is now the king of the world.

485
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
You can't be a lazy person.

486
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,920
From now on...

487
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,600
Sister,

488
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
what's wrong with you?

489
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
You've lost your way once.

490
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,040
Now you're so lazy.

491
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,560
You used to love me the most.

492
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Now,

493
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,120
you're like Minister Du and the others.

494
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,960
You're like Minister Du and the others.

495
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,480
No matter how much you don't want to,

496
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,960
tomorrow,

497
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
you must show up in a decent way.

498
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,200
I'll play with you when I come back.

499
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,920
Thank you for your blessing.

500
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,520
I know you came out

501
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,080
to stop Minister Du.

502
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,280
But I don't understand...

503
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,520
It's a pity that

504
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,560
you two are so cruel to each other.

505
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,280
Does the real person know who I am?

506
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,480
Since you don't want to tell me,

507
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,600
I don't need to ask.

508
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
But do you know

509
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,320
what's the secret

510
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,960
in Minister Du's heart?

511
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
He's not afraid to spend all his efforts.

512
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,400
He's afraid that he can't see

513
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,080
the new king of Tang.

514
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,080
His Majesty is trying to make a good fortune.

515
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,880
I can't let His Majesty

516
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,120
walk alone on this road.

517
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,400
Three years is enough.

518
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,520
I'm willing to walk with His Majesty

519
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,960
for a long time.

520
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,080
Let's see if we can

521
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,920
create a good fortune.

522
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,680
Maybe the way you two think

523
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,360
is the same.

524
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,640
But there are different things.

525
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,920
Does the real person know

526
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,560
what my way is?

527
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,520
I don't dare to talk about it.

528
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,520
I just think you are selfish.

529
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
But I heard that

530
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,760
your way is like a mess.

531
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,480
If I don't listen to the teachings

532
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,000
and do nothing,

533
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,560
what should I do?

534
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,720
For a river,

535
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,640
it doesn't matter if it's Lu Zhang

536
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,760
or Tiger Wolf who drinks water.

537
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,440
Besides, Tiger Wolf knows that

538
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,080
the hunter is the one who wants to stop him.

539
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,760
But what does it have to do with the river?

540
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
It's the natural law.

541
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,680
It's the right way.

542
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,840
Just like the refugees in Luoyang,

543
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,440
as long as they have a mother,

544
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,080
they can start a new family.

545
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,640
They don't want

546
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,000
a life without any obstacles.

547
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,240
They want a peaceful life.

548
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,280
You are so wise.

549
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,920
I want to keep you in the Taoist Temple.

550
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,160
True person,

551
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,360
where should I go to find the natural law?

552
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,920
Everything is born with the nature of being.

553
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,480
You even found your true nature.

554
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,720
How can you say that you can't find the natural law?

555
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,600
I see.

556
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
Now, can you tell me

557
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,000
what your true nature is?

558
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,320
I thought

559
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,760
I could get back what I lost.

560
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,520
But now I know

561
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
what I have to fight against.

562
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,160
I don't want to give up.

563
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,560
But I don't want to wait.

564
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
I want to see the Tang Dynasty

565
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
in my lifetime.

566
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,360
I want to kill the troubled world myself

567
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,720
and give it back to him.

568
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,560
Do you know what you are talking about?

569
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
I don't want to break my nature.

570
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,120
Right.

571
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,080
It's my fault.

572
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,520
How can you be a peaceful person

573
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,920
after you have killed the extremely hard-withered world?

574
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,480
Madam,

575
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Sheng Xin has made the arrangements.

576
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,240
Luoyang's guards

577
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,480
are now under the charge of Du Ruhui.

578
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,520
Yes.

579
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,520
But for the sake of the White Horse Four Seasons,

580
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,280
Du Ruhui has already transferred some of his men

581
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,440
from Ziwei Palace.

582
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
They have always been on the eastern border.

583
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,120
Our men

584
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,920
are always watching their movements.

585
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,320
There is another person

586
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,640
who also needs to be watched.

587
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,320
Li Jing, who destroyed Xiao Liang.

588
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,880
Come and have a look.

589
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,280
Come and have a look.

590
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,240
Come and have a look.

591
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,680
Come and have a look.

592
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,400
Wait. Wait.

593
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,280
Let me see.

594
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,320
You should follow this

595
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,320
to save Zhao.

596
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,440
Do you know

597
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,400
that a gentleman should be watched.

598
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,800
I'm trying to help you.

599
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,200
You don't appreciate it.

600
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,440
This is...

601
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,320
Where did Yin Feng come from?

602
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,600
Madam.

603
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,080
Madam.

604
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,240
Why is Madam here?

605
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,200
You have worked hard outside.

606
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
Your guests are here.

607
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,960
You are not at home.

608
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,120
You are still playing games with people here.

609
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,520
You are not happy.

610
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,520
I feel sorry for you.

611
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,720
Come and have a look.

612
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,880
I... I'm not tired.

613
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm not tired.

614
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,320
I'm tired.

615
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
I'm too tired.

616
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
I'm tired.

617
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,240
I'm too tired.

618
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
I'll go back with Madam.

619
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,280
Please, Madam.

620
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,760
Madam.

621
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,200
Is the guest at home

622
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,880
the same one?

623
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,560
Duke Du came to the house again.

624
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,480
He asked you to take over the Ministry of War for him.

625
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,240
I've sent it for you.

626
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,840
It's a great honor

627
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,000
to have a good wife.

628
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,000
Come.

629
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,200
I see. I see.

630
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I'll go back to wash my hands and share my fragrance.

631
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,160
I'll kneel and exercise my knees.

632
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,280
Do you know that

633
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,360
the Crown Prince's loss of virtue

634
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,040
is going to be a big hit in Luoyang?

635
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,240
Really?

636
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,240
Yes.

637
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,160
How can it be fake?

638
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,400
Think about it.

639
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,880
Who is going to

640
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
suffer the suffering?

641
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,040
If it wasn't for the Crown Prince's loss of virtue,

642
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,560
Yes.

643
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,000
would we be like this now?

644
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,240
Yes.

645
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,360
Now,

646
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,240
even God can't stand it.

647
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
He wants to punish the Crown Prince.

648
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,600
Great.

649
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Great.

650
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,840
Great.

651
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,480
Great.

652
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,280
Great.

653
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,080
Great.

654
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,000
Great.

655
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,920
Don't miss any meal.

656
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,920
Or you'll kneel for an hour.

657
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,200
Yes.

658
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,960
shallot

659
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,440
opinion

660
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,640
Don't move.

661
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,400
Who are you?

662
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,760
Good man.

663
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,360
How dare you sprinkle flour on me?

664
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,120
I'm warning you

665
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,440
to explain me.

666
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,400
Or you'll die here today.

667
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,040
Who are you after all?

668
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,520
You followed me and let me explain it.

669
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,440
What can I tell you?

670
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Tell me where the person who made you spread the rumor is.

671
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Do you know who spread the rumor?

672
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
Who are you?

673
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Tell me where the person is.

674
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,640
This is a dead body.

675
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
This is not his secret.

676
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Wait.

677
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,080
Who is he?

678
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,360
This is a dead body.

679
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,080
This is a dead body.

680
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,880
You spread the rumour and made sure that the person who spread the rumor

681
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,560
has a real blood carnal gangster of convenience

682
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,760
inside his body.

683
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:37,700
As the title road always which means

684
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,120
dead body of Zhen Wuyi.

685
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,160
It can be used to find possible clues who is the murderer.

686
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,820
This is the town of Student of Salt 계所 in Southwedding Province's

687
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,480
mosque,

688
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,920
but he's still not home.

689
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,960
Mr. Du,

690
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,840
my husband has said many times

691
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,720
that he didn't mean to go to Chang'an.

692
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm sorry to disturb you,

693
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,440
but I still want to talk to Mr. Li

694
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,000
before I give up.

695
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,960
It's up to you.

696
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,960
Please enjoy.

697
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,080
Mr. Du.

698
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Please enjoy.

699
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,200
Mr. Du,

700
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
my husband wants to talk to you,

701
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,540
but he hasn't come in yet.

702
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,440
He said

703
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,500
he wouldn't see you這下 Arduinoíll

704
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,380
see you.

705
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,520
Why is he disappointed?

706
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,360
He lumped in

707
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,840
our joint but didn't come in.

708
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,480
We're all here,

709
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,800
but hetxas and others

710
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,400
didn't form our team.

711
00:35:49,480 --> 00:36:14,400
Brother']

712
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,120
Changge.

713
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,240
Something strange.

714
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Something strange?

715
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,000
He's just a greedy man.

716
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,360
I really didn't see anything strange.

717
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,560
Can you try to

718
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,680
bring me to Ziwei Palace?

719
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,720
Your Highness,

720
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,720
you should always try the ceremony.

721
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,880
Otherwise, if there's anything

722
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,120
that doesn't make sense,

723
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,360
it'll be too late to change it.

724
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,920
Nothing makes sense?

725
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,520
You're the most unreasonable one.

726
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,720
I've said it before.

727
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,480
Minister Du's old man

728
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
is not here right now.

729
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,840
Why don't you take me

730
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,880
to the Hall of Flamingo

731
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,840
and the Fangs' Hall?

732
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,440
Since you don't want to take me,

733
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,520
why do you say that?

734
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,520
You've made me feel uncomfortable.

735
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,200
It's all my fault.

736
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,360
But as long as you're safe tonight,

737
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,440
I'll figure out a way

738
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
to take you out.

739
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,640
All right.

740
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,920
You may leave.

741
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,920
Yes.

742
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,960
sugars

743
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,280
Don't be nervous.

744
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,680
Remember,

745
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,560
I'm the Taoist priest who helps you with the prayer.

746
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,480
As long as we stay calm,

747
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,800
it won't work.

748
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,200
Hurry up.

749
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,360
Tie Li Chengxian up.

750
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,080
Yes.

751
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,680
Go.

752
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,560
So you're looking for an old friend.

753
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,000
Even if you're not on the same side with him,

754
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,200
it seems that you're not a good person.

755
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,200
It's a long time ago.

756
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,200
My old friend,

757
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,960
he can't arrange this.

758
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,640
So this must have nothing to do with him.

759
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,960
Then who is your old friend?

760
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,560
Why do you think

761
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,920
he's the one who spread the news about the Crown Prince?

762
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Does he know the Crown Prince?

763
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,280
I'm here to drink tea with you

764
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,560
because you're a gentleman.

765
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Don't ask about other people's private affairs.

766
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,800
My old friend,

767
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,960
he can never do anything to hurt the Tang Dynasty.

768
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,960
If you still want to pursue him,

769
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,920
I won't accompany you.

770
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,040
Okay.

771
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
I won't pursue him anymore.

772
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,080
Do you know Ziwei Palace?

773
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,440
Ziwei Palace?

774
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
If your old friend

775
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,480
knows the Crown Prince,

776
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,760
you might be able to

777
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,240
find your old friend there.

778
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,960
Don't be stubborn.

779
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Ziwei Palace.

780
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,880
This is Ziwei Palace.

781
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,560
Fire!

782
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,600
Hurry up.

783
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,160
Fire!

784
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,920
Hurry up.

785
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,960
Fire!

786
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,880
Hurry up.

787
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Fire!

788
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Fire!

789
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Water!

790
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Water!

791
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Hurry up.

792
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Water!

793
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Fire!

794
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
Fire!

795
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Fire!

796
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Fire!

797
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Fire!

798
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Fire!

799
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Hurry up.

800
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Hurry up.

801
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Fire!

802
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
I've been waiting for you.

803
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
You're so late.

804
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Fire!

805
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Fire!

806
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Fire!

807
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
What's going on?

808
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,360
Your Highness,

809
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,920
Zi...

810
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Ziwei Palace is on fire.

811
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,120
Where's the Crown Prince?

812
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
How is the Crown Prince?

813
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,280
I...

814
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I don't know.

815
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Let's go to the Palace to save him.

816
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Let's go.

817
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Hurry up.

818
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Yes.

819
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Fire!

820
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Fire!

821
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Fire!

822
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Stop.

823
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Stop.

824
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Fire!

825
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Fire!

826
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Fire!

827
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Why are you following me?

828
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
To save him.

829
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
You can't go there.

830
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm the only one

831
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
who can do something.

832
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
You're going to find your old friend, right?

833
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm looking for someone,

834
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
but I'm also saving someone.

835
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Okay.

836
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
I believe you.

837
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
But you have to follow me.

838
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless.

839
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Let's go.

840
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Let's go.

841
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Fire!

842
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Fire!

843
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Where's the Crown Prince?

844
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Fire!

845
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
The Crown Prince is out.

846
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Your Highness,

847
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
the Crown Prince

848
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
should still be in there.

849
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
We've already found him.

850
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
But we haven't found him yet.

851
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Stop.

852
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Your Highness,

853
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
you can't.

854
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Let's go.

855
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,520
Fire!

856
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Changge,

857
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
have you found my brother?

858
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
No.

859
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
But I saw a person

860
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
wearing the Crown Prince's clothes.

861
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
What?

862
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
He's going to the prayer ceremony tomorrow.

863
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
He can't be in the bedroom.

864
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,520
I don't know.

865
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,520
But it looks like

866
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
a long-term plan.

867
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Leyan,

868
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
I was just seen.

869
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
It's not a long time.

870
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
I'll go back first.

871
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
If anything happens,

872
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
you can come to the Liuyun Temple to find me.

873
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Okay.

874
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
Be careful.

875
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
You too.

876
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,520
When I think of your figure,

877
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,520
it's trapped in my dream.

878
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,520
Before dawn,

879
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
before midnight,

880
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,520
my longing flows.

881
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,520
There's always a moment

882
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,520
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

883
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
There's always a moment

884
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,640
that freezes everything between you and me.

885
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
In each other's world,

886
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,640
in different worlds,

887
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,640
my longings become a cocoon.

888
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,640
Like the little stars,

889
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,760
they become the cocoon in the sky forever.

890
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,760
There's always a moment

891
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,760
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

892
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,760
There's always a moment

893
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,760
that freezes everything between you and me.

894
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,880
In each other's world,

895
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,880
in different worlds,

896
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,880
my longings become a cocoon.

897
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,880
Like the little stars,

898
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,880
they become the cocoon in the sky forever.

899
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,880
Forever.
