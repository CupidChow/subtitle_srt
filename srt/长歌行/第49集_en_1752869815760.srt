1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am the one who has been through the darkness

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am the one who has been through the long yearning

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the one who has been through the life and the crazy of not forgetting

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ruyue, all the way here,

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
sometimes I will be impulsive and reckless

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sometimes I will misunderstand you

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am lucky to have your tolerance and help

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know you don't like to hear harsh words

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I really want to say thank you

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know when we can meet again

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Changge, take care

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Take care

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Take good care of Changge

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wish you happiness

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Brother Wei, thank you

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sun, do you think Mimi will like here?

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What if she doesn't like it?

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When you dream of her, you can ask

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The water here is wide

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She will like it

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Changge, when you went to Wangcheng to pick up the hairpins

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Have you ever thought about it?

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It may be interesting

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Have you ever thought about your life and death for me in Chang'an?

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Actually, I saw the wedding star you wrote to my mother

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I am sorry

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, what do you think?

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I think

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We don't need to have any problems

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have you in my life

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Me too

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have you in my life

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
By the way, how did you contact General Li?

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I sent him a message

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Did you contact him after he was taken back to Dingxiang?

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Actually, I made a promise to him before I left Chang'an

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Brother Li

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
General Li

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother Qin, we meet again

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I am afraid I can't be with you now

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It doesn't matter

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Brother Qin

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you remember what I said to you when we left Luoyang?

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The heart of the people is invincible

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But now Princess Yicheng is in danger

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She ordered the army to take the grasslands and deserts and make them the capital

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The people are like the jade

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The war is spreading day by day

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We have different camp

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The grasslands are different from the Central Plains

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But the people are afraid of the war and want to live

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to know

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Brother Qin, can you help the people and the people of the Banzu

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
To save the people from the theft?

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have a condition

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want to ask Tang to help me save Yan Li and Khan

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ok

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I promise you

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Although Ashile Chuobi is strong and ready to fight, he is always ready to fight

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But he is still able to guard the line after being fed

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He will not die

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you for your kindness

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I am in the middle of nowhere

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have no way to get out of here

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't know how to help the general

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I need you to go back to Dingxiang and grow up again

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I will die for the rest of my life

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you want to go back to the city, I'm afraid it's harder than climbing the sky

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ashile Sun, you are hiding from me again

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You are really a coward

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have no choice but to go back to the city

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will not let you go

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Ashile Sun, you are hiding from me again

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are really a coward

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have no choice but to go back to the city

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sun

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you like Chang'an?

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you want to go back?

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It will be troublesome if there are too many acquaintances

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Where do you want to go in the future?

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I haven't decided yet

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Then what are you afraid of more?

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What difference does it make?

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How about going back to the city now?

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me talk to you

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't dare to go back

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,400
dry

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sun

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
Find the top

99
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,120
Come on

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,080
I said what I said

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,960
What's the first thing?

102
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
You're still going to say those three things?

103
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,080
You'd better not say that first.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,840
You got shot

105
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,120
before you finished the first thing.

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm afraid it's a little unlucky.

107
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,760
Forget about him.

108
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,480
It's the first time

109
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,880
I've seen you being so cheeky.

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm not cheeky.

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
Okay, then you say it.

112
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,880
The second thing

113
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,400
I want you to never say sorry to me again.

114
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
Don't say thank you or anything.

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,240
You and I don't need to say that.

116
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,640
That's it?

117
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Is the second thing too easy?

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,280
Just pretend it.

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
Why don't you say the third thing?

120
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
I can do it earlier.

121
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,520
The third thing...

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,520
We'll talk about it later.

123
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,200
It's a long time.

124
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,880
Haodong, why are you here?

125
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
It's not possible for a princess to come here.

126
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
Aren't you getting married soon?

127
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,800
I've already paid my respects to them.

128
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
That's good.

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,280
No,

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,040
you shouldn't have come.

131
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,600
I have to protect the person

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,560
she wants to protect for Leyan.

133
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,760
All right, all right.

134
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,560
It's a blessing for Prince Consort to come.

135
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Report!

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm here to see you.

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I'm here to see you.

138
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
I'm here to see you.

139
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm here to see you.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm here to see you.

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,680
Speak.

142
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
The Eastern Road Division has reported that

143
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,200
the White Dao has discovered the trace of the Dingxiang Army.

144
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,160
It seems that the Ghost City

145
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
wants to break through the White Dao through the Qikou.

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,680
Send a message to Li Ji immediately to block from the front

147
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,240
and attack from the front and back of the Ministry of Revenue.

148
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,040
Yes.

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,560
General Li,

150
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
you sent two troops to investigate.

151
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
But the other one

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
hasn't returned yet.

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
It's possible.

154
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
What's the possibility?

155
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
The message hasn't been sent yet.

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,280
If the message doesn't mean that there is no enemy in this direction,

157
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
it's also possible that the Red Marquis is in danger

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,400
and hasn't returned yet.

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,680
How about this?

160
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I'll take Eagle Division to see it.

161
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,440
In this way, we don't have to delay the army's troops.

162
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
I'll go with you.

163
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,840
No.

164
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
This is just my guess.

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Maybe it will be a waste of time.

166
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,560
Maybe

167
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,560
it will be in danger.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,400
You'd better stay with General Li

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
and help him come up with a plan.

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
But...

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,240
Princess,

172
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm afraid we can't let you go.

173
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,360
We'll go with the army.

174
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
No one will stay.

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,440
If we want to get the message,

176
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,680
someone must handle it.

177
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,680
Otherwise,

178
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,640
we can't handle it.

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm afraid it will be a waste of time.

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,440
Prince Consort is brave and good at fighting.

181
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,840
Can you stay

182
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,480
and stay with the princess

183
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,440
to make sure everything is perfect?

184
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
If anything happens,

185
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
you two can cooperate

186
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,360
and act accordingly.

187
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,160
I won't let you down.

188
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,880
I won't let you down.

189
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,560
I didn't expect

190
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,080
the little princess who was

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,680
a troublemaker

192
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
to protect the country

193
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
with her power.

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,680
You've worked hard

195
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
all the way here.

196
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,520
You flatter me.

197
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,160
I just want to do my best

198
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,440
to help the country.

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Yicheng is very cunning.

200
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
You must be careful.

201
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,360
Don't worry.

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,440
She's a strong woman.

203
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,880
This time,

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
we must destroy the country,

205
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,600
the desert

206
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,920
and the whole grassland.

207
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,160
Suen.

208
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,080
I'll go with you.

209
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,600
Mu Jin, you just...

210
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm your brother.

211
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,880
You're the military counselor of Eagle Division.

212
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
How can you lead the army

213
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
and take the enemy?

214
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,200
Okay.

215
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
Okay.

216
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,040
Go.

217
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
There are many people

218
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,400
chasing after the troops.

219
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,160
Fulou.

220
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Take Ke Han away first.

221
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,920
I'll take care of the rest.

222
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,480
Yes.

223
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,520
Wait.

224
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,440
Take care of it?

225
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,160
Kill more people?

226
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,520
Xiao Ke Han can

227
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,800
survive without killing.

228
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
After all, we have our men to take care of.

229
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,400
I'll be the villain.

230
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,120
You'll be the good guy.

231
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,720
If you really do it for my mother,

232
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
just stop it

233
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,400
and reduce your sins.

234
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,480
Your mother raised you for nothing.

235
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,440
Get out.

236
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,000
Tu Lu Ke.

237
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,240
Let's go, Xiao Ke Han.

238
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,960
Go.

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:39,960
Go.

240
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,960
Go.

241
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,080
Go.

242
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,240
Come on.

243
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,640
It's lucky.

244
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Perhaps God

245
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
is better in our side.

246
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,720
So what if you're so lucky?

247
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
You did a good job today.

248
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,160
Gods got eye

249
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
and made you here.

250
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,920
Want revenge?

251
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,880
Quick enough.

252
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,320
Take it.

253
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,040
You go.

254
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,280
He

255
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,040
Give it to me.

256
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,800
Okay.

257
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,200
Stop them.

258
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,080
Me.

259
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,040
Turn around, turn.

260
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,640
Saw it.

261
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Over here very well.

262
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm very careful.

263
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,040
The carpenter vet is very nice.

264
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,760
Don't worry about that.

265
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm always very careful.

266
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,680
Don't be hopeless.

267
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,160
I just...

268
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,480
I just...

269
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,520
when I saw what happened,

270
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
I was quite anxious.

271
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,840
But when the sun goes down without because it's a pretty bitter,

272
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,840
and I made a시간 of music for Elle Roche's concert,

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,880
it's just to commit war with my feelings.

274
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,080
I won't leave with you.

275
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,360
I will never surrender to Ashile Sun.

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,960
Just like you will never surrender to me.

277
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,840
All of you, back off!

278
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,680
Don't you understand?

279
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes.

280
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,280
I will never surrender to you.

281
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,720
I will never surrender to you.

282
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
I will never surrender to you.

283
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
I will never surrender to you.

284
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,800
You won't understand why Mimi died.

285
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
It's not because your sword

286
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,880
is for freedom.

287
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,560
A person like you who only obeys orders

288
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,560
and tramples on people's lives

289
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
and doesn't even know how to cherish

290
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
won't understand.

291
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,920
It's not an order.

292
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,640
It's not an order.

293
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,880
It's not an order.

294
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,080
It's not an order.

295
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,880
It's not an order.

296
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,680
It's not an order.

297
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,400
It's not an order.

298
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,560
To obey orders

299
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,680
is to obey orders.

300
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,680
komen

301
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,320
Sher.

302
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,280
Is this what you really want?

303
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,400
Why?

304
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
You just moved me

305
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,840
when I let you go.

306
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,440
Don't show mercy in the future.

307
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,400
Admit it.

308
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
You are the one who feels sorry.

309
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,280
Why?

310
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm tired.

311
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,920
Only your sword

312
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,240
can take my blood.

313
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,360
Shuo,

314
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,800
you don't have to punish yourself for others' mistakes.

315
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,880
You're innocent.

316
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,520
I'll pay for Anna's sins.

317
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
Sun, promise me.

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
Let go of the Wolf Division.

319
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,120
They're the soldiers of Ashile Tribe.

320
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
They shouldn't have fought for Dingxiang.

321
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,560
You're a petty Khan.

322
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Take them with you

323
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,320
and live a free life.

324
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,280
Sun,

325
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,040
I still really want to fight with you

326
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,240
and enjoy xe insert Refer saúde.

327
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,760
I don't know if I have a chance.

328
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,040
I think you will have it.

329
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,200
We'll meet again

330
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,880
while the battle since the war

331
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,400
has stopped.

332
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,480
Chief Wang Xi,

333
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,160
I'll wait.

334
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,880
Hey,

335
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
Yuanyang.

336
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Yuanyang.

337
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Wolf Division, listen up!

338
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,520
Come on!

339
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
Let him go!

340
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,140
Let's go

341
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,360
The enemy's army is attacking the battle at the entrance of the mountain.

342
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,440
General Li has already broken through.

343
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
They are now attacking the battle.

344
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,640
Keep searching.

345
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,440
Yes.

346
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
General Li is really a genius.

347
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,480
King Sui,

348
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
my second uncle traveled the world

349
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
and asked for a hostage.

350
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,440
The imperial heir of Gongsun

351
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,280
has been a bad hand for decades.

352
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
He asked for a hostage.

353
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,240
But General Li is different.

354
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
He is a hostage

355
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,760
for the war.

356
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,800
Kill them!

357
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,480
Kill them!

358
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,640
General Du,

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,680
the leaders of each department

360
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,560
escaped from the west mountain

361
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,680
with a car.

362
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,360
General Li was unable to recover for a while.

363
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,120
He needs to ride the army to support him.

364
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,760
I'll go.

365
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,080
I can't let Yicheng escape.

366
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,800
Be careful.

367
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,640
Be careful.

368
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,280
How is Eagle Division?

369
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,800
Eagle Division is at the entrance of Wudou Valley.

370
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,840
They are chasing after the enemy's branches.

371
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,480
The leader of the enemy, Lei Meng, was killed.

372
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
Eagle Division's special forces

373
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,360
have surrounded the capital.

374
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,280
Ashile and Xiao Kehan.

375
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,920
Okay.

376
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,760
Go and check again.

377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,520
Yes.

378
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,800
governmental official

379
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,800
lào

380
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,760
Go.

381
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,240
Everyone,

382
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,120
the alliance between Tang and other tribes

383
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
is for the common prosperity

384
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,600
and for Changyuan's support.

385
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
Yicheng is just trying to

386
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,240
frame you up.

387
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
Do you still want to

388
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,040
work for him?

389
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,640
Tang is not willing to be your enemy.

390
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,880
If you stop the war here,

391
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,280
you can go home

392
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,560
and take care of your wives and children.

393
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,200
You can also let your tribe

394
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,360
live a life

395
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,440
of cattle, sheep, and cattle.

396
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,360
You can live a life of being in the water.

397
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,360
If you are not clear about it,

398
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,880
you can continue to set fire to the border.

399
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,320
Tang

400
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,960
will not give in.

401
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We will not give in.

402
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
We will not give in.

403
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
We will not give in.

404
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
We will not give in.

405
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
We will not give in.

406
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
We will not give in.

407
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
We will not give in.

408
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
We will not give in.

409
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
We will not give in.

410
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
We will not give in.

411
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,040
We will not give in.

412
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,200
We will not give in.

413
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,120
Go home and take care of your children.

414
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,280
Who is willing to fight?

415
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,280
Who wants to fight?

416
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,720
Go.

417
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,560
Go.

418
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,400
aspect.

419
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,640
General Li, please come back.

420
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,440
Report!

421
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,040
I'm going to the Great Sheng.

422
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
General Li is back.

423
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Congratulations on your defeat.

424
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
General, please rest assured.

425
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,280
Hao Du has gone to catch someone.

426
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,520
He won't let Yicheng run away.

427
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,720
Good job.

428
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,000
Hao Du.

429
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
How is it? Did you catch him?

430
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,360
He's not here.

431
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,040
He didn't take the car to escape.

432
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,720
Where is he?

433
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,080
Maybe he didn't expect it.

434
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:34,200
攻火花

435
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
In order to achieve your goal,

436
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400
you tried to get the secret.

437
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,080
You've hurt many people's hearts.

438
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,800
If that's the case,

439
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,920
I'd rather be a loser.

440
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,280
You won't understand.

441
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
You'll never understand!

442
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,080
I'm the princess of Sui.

443
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
I was born and raised in Sui.

444
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,200
That's my homeland.

445
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,920
I must save it!

446
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,480
Your homeland is still there.

447
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,520
It hasn't disappeared.

448
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,600
Its land is still there.

449
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
Its people are still there.

450
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,360
Besides, you've hurt its people.

451
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,400
The only thing that disappeared

452
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,840
was the glory of the royal family.

453
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,640
Is that so important?

454
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,720
Royal family?

455
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm not a royal family.

456
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,800
I'm just

457
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
a daughter of the imperial clan.

458
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,240
The most glorious day

459
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,760
of my life.

460
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
It's the day

461
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,840
I was promoted to princess.

462
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,160
I've never been to the palace

463
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,080
and never worn such a gorgeous dress.

464
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,880
It's said that thousands of people

465
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,920
and officials welcome me.

466
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,000
They said that from today on,

467
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll be the princess of Sui.

468
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,840
Sui

469
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,200
needs me to marry her.

470
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,080
From now on,

471
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,120
you'll be my partner.

472
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
I'll do my best

473
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,760
to protect you

474
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,960
and protect you from death.

475
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,480
I've promised.

476
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,000
This is my honor

477
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,160
and my destiny.

478
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm the princess of Sui.

479
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,200
I'm willing to sacrifice everything for her.

480
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm a princess,

481
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080
I'll last forever

482
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,120
and before I die.

483
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,900
How can I

484
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,560
live at the victorious side of man포

485
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,320
and get my pulpit?

486
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
That's the reason I'm a princess.

487
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If I get married,

488
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,200
whether I send some girls to enjoy the waste...

489
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,480
I don't need your sympathy

490
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,040
or any mercy andkr.

491
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,040
You abandoned the country.

492
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Only me.

493
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
For 30 years,

494
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I was the only one trapped on the grassland.

495
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I haven't abandoned the country.

496
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Come back.

497
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
The country is gone.

498
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Where do you want me to go?

499
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Your hometown is still there.

500
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Chang'an is still there.

501
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
The Daxing Palace is still there.

502
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
The trees in the palace

503
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
were planted by the Daxue Emperor in the open year.

504
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
When I was a child,

505
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
my friends and I used to climb trees.

506
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
We used to rely on it to escape from the guests.

507
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
As long as you are willing to come back,

508
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
return to Chang'an.

509
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
I know my uncle's background.

510
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
He won't kill you.

511
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I am a person

512
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
who is willing to go to the West.

513
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
How can I go this way?

514
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Even if you are Li Changge,

515
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
will you still return to Chang'an?

516
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Yes.

517
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
I was wrong.

518
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
In my life,

519
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
I have been a humiliating joke.

520
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I don't ask for anyone's forgiveness.

521
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,040
But I still want to thank you.

522
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
You are alive.

523
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I am willing to go to the West.

524
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
I am willing to go to the West.

525
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
The last time.

526
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Grandmother.

527
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Is this Chang'an?

528
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Yes.

529
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
We are going home.

530
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
I am going home.

531
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
A Yan.

532
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
A Yan.

533
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
Sister Dingxiang.

534
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Sister Dingxiang.

535
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Sister Yinshan.

536
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
A Yan.

537
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Don't worry.

538
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I will take good care of Leyan.

539
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
A Yan.

540
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Hao Duo and I will be fine.

541
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
A Yan.

542
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
You can rest well now.

543
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Please accept my condolences.

544
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Did she suffer?

545
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Did you mean Li Changge?

546
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Princess is strong and well-maintained.

547
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,040
She is safe enough under the Jiuquan.

548
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
She is safe enough under the Jiuquan.

549
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
I am sorry.

550
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
I am sorry.

551
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
I am sorry.

552
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Your Majesty.

553
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
You are safe enough.

554
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,040
What did she say at last?

555
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,040
She said she was grateful to you.

556
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
What else did she say?

557
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,040
She said she liked reading.

558
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
In the future, when it's Han's Festival,

559
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
she will read more books.

560
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
I saw her grow up.

561
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,040
I didn't know she liked reading.

562
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
She doesn't like reading.

563
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
She doesn't look like it.

564
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Li Yaoshi.

565
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Do you know what is the crime of deceiving the emperor?

566
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
I know I am guilty.

567
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
But Li Changge...

568
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
I was forced to do so.

569

Get up.

570
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
What happened?

571
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Changge.

572
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Changge.

573
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Didn't you promise me?

574
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
You can't...

575
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
You can't do anything to me.

You can't do anything to me.

578
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
You know you can't wait for me to come back.

579
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I know I am wrong.

580
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Don't be angry.

581
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Princess.

582
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Princess.

583
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Are you really not going back to Chang'an with me?

584
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
General Li, what are you talking about?

585
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Everything has disappeared with that fire.

586
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Where did you come from?

587
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
I came here to visit you.

588
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
It is not bad.

Thank you.

591
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
You're really heartless.

592
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,040
I have a disciple and a soldier.

593
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
General Li.

594
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
If His Majesty asks about it after you return.

595
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Tell him to erase my name from the history book.

596
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,680
I'm sorry.

597
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Where are you going

598
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
in the future?

599
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,960
Don't ask about that.

600
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,720
Everyone is in this situation.

601
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,880
No one can escape.

602
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
If His Majesty asks,

603
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,200
just tell him

604
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,880
everything is up to him.

605
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,880
Ling Hugeyuan

606
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Alright.

607
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,080
Maybe

608
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,640
you'll meet her some day.

609
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
The Temple of lunch

610
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
You are

611
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,080
Is this the way

612
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,920
you want?

613
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,840
I've been walking outside for a long time.

614
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,560
I've realized that

615
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,040
the state is peaceful

616
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,720
and everyone lives happily.

617
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,680
The state is prosperous

618
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
and the people are safe.

619
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,000
In the past, I was the only one who was humiliated.

620
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,720
Now,

621
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,840
I can finally let go of it.

622
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,720
Now, I'm in the right place.

623
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,520
I've made a name for myself.

624
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,880
I've done my best.

625
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,280
The world is in chaos.

626
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,040
