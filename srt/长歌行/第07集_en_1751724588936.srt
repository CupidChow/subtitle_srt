1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
To the distance

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Still has to fly

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Following the light

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
To forget you

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,600
The memory of this is like a stubbornness

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,600
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
To return to the long yearning in the past

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Climbing the river of life and the crazy of the past

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,800
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Episode 16

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm not here to seek a friend

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm here to help you

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
You mean

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Now Li Shimin is in the Chuge

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
He will spread the army and guard all four directions

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
To be safe

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
If the troops of Youzhou can also split up

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
The attack is not ready

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Nanlinpu, Jiao, West Ru Tongguan

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
At this time, what is the two armies?

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Should not be searched, the world is set

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
What the princess means is

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
The princess is really well-known

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
The blood of our family

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Of course there is no trouble

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Princess, you came from the capital

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Do you know what the situation is?

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
What is the order of the Crown Prince?

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I came for this

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Before the father's disaster, I gave the order

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Lu Jiang Wang Li Yuan listens to the order

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Call King Jin Qin Li Shimin and others to rebel

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,600
The

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
The crisis is involved

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
The capital's governor Lu Jiang Wang Li Yuan and others

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
To lead troops to the capital to kill the rebels

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,440
The

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
Li Yuan listens to the order

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Your order

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
The problem of the Youzhou is solved

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
We are so hurry to get the weapons

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm afraid that the army will be tired after the battle

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
With this order

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
The Crown Prince's old department will definitely help

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Commander, the envoy of Chang'an is here

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Waiting in the front hall

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Li Shimin's envoy is here so soon

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Uncle Tao

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
According to Changge's opinion

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
It's good not to see this envoy

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Princess, don't worry

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Now the big plan is set

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
With this order in hand

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I will not let the Crown Prince take the lead

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Since the envoy of the rebels

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Send to the door

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Why don't we take the opportunity to take it

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
To escape the evil

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
The

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
The

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
The

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
The

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
The

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
The

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
The

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
The

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
The

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
The Crown Prince's order

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
To take down the rebels

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Wang Junguo falsely passed the order

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
What should be the crime

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Kill

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Wait

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Wei Shuyu

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Changge

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Changge, why are you here

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
You still have the face to ask me

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
You listen to me explain

82
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
What do you have to explain

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
If you surrender now

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
I can spare your life

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Changge, you are crazy

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Do you know what you are doing

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
You are helping people rebel

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's because I don't have the luck of the envoy

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I can get up from the tomb

90
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
And find another master

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Now

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:00,100
People are the

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
The

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
The

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
The

96
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
The

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
The

98
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
The

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
The

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
The

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
The

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
The

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
The

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
The

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
The

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
The

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
The

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
The

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Let me go

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Say that again

111
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Kill

112
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Your highness

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
What we are doing today

114
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
We need a sacrifice

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
General

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
You know about the prince's horse

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Wei Zheng is the son of the late emperor of the Eastern Palace.

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
He is the son of Wei Zheng.

119
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
If I kill him,

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm afraid the Eastern Palace will be shocked.

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I've heard that Wei Xian Ma is loyal to the Crown Prince.

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
I didn't expect to have such a weak son.

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
A traitor.

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
What right do you have to talk about my father?

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
You!

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The envoy has wrongly trusted the King of Qin.

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
The King of Qin can see my loyalty to the Tang Dynasty.

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
The Crown Prince is about to die.

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
We are the traitors of the Feng Clan.

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Chang Ge.

131
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Guards!

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Take him to the dungeon and watch him closely.

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Don't move.

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Chang Ge, you...

135
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Go.

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Go.

137
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Yong Ning.

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Although the envoy has been taken,

139
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Chang'an is hard to avoid for a long time.

140
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Besides, if you leak the news in Youzhou,

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
it will be very unfavorable for our future plans.

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
In my opinion,

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
why don't you stay in my mansion for a few days?

144
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
No need, Uncle Tang.

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I have a place to stay.

146
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll come to you tomorrow morning.

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
You are new to Youzhou.

148
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Besides,

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
it will be very troublesome if you are watched by the eyes of Youzhou.

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
How about this?

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I'll send a team of people to protect you in secret.

152
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Uncle Tang,

153
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I can go all the way from Chang'an.

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I'll stay here.

155
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I'll take good care of myself.

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Goodbye.

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Junkuo.

158
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,800
The envoy of Chang'an must have entered the trap.

159
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
The Fourteenth Prince has not been caught.

160
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
This wound...

161
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
It's so strange.

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
The Fourteenth Prince

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Let's go.

164
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
That way.

165
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Why are the people of the Duoduo Mansion following the Fourteenth Prince?

166
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's getting more and more interesting.

167
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Who is the Fourteenth Prince?

168
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Duoduo.

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Duoduo.

170
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Is there anything wrong with this edict?

171
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
The Fourteenth Prince

172
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
You two go out of the city immediately.

173
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Put on a white coat before going to the grass outside the city.

174
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Remember,

175
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
don't be found by anyone.

176
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Wait for the guest from the north to contact you.

177
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes.

178
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Master is back.

179
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Master, why are you hurt?

180
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Master.

181
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Master, why are you so badly hurt?

182
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
It's okay.

183
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
A'Dou.

184
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Someone was following me just now.

185
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Master, who is following you?

186
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I don't know.

187
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
I suspect it may be someone from Uncle Tang's side.

188
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
But I can't do it now.

189
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Because the only one who can rely on now

190
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
is only Uncle Tang.

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Master, you still have me.

192
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Dongbing.

193
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Shanhulu.

194
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
If I don't hear the name, I won't show up.

195
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
So what?

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
The wounded team has a lot of goods.

197
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
They won't wash the floor.

198
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
As long as you give me a place to hide.

199
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Not afraid of death.

200
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
There is such a strange word in the world.

201
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
It's called the world of death.

202
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
It's a world of death.

203
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
It's a world of death.

204
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
It's a world of death.

205
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
It's a world of death.

206
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
It's a world of death.

207
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
It's a world of death.

208
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
It's a world of death.

209
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
It's a world of death.

210
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
It's a world of death.

211
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
It's a world of death.

212
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
It's a world of death.

213
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
It's a world of death.

214
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
It's a world of death.

215
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
It's a world of death.

216
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Zhou Yue.

217
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
You are indeed a good friend of the owner.

218
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
You guessed he would pass by.

219
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Who is it?

220
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
What's wrong?

221
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You cried.

222
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
No.

223
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Men can cry too.

224
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
No need to be embarrassed.

225
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
I don't like crying since I was a child.

226
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't cry when I'm bleeding.

227
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Don't be so strong.

228
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
People will be sad.

229
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
It's okay.

230
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
I'll go back to sleep first.

231
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm in a bad mood.

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I wonder if you can go out with me.

233
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Now?

234
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
It's already quiet outside.

235
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
It's really crazy.

236
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You are afraid of people who are quiet.

237
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Where to?

238
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
What?

239
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Afraid I'll sell you?

240
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm afraid you don't have the ability.

241
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
I'll go first.

242
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Why did you bring me here?

243
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
It's far from the mortal world.

244
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
It's closer to the moon.

245
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
It's closer to the moon.

246
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I seem to be closer to you,

247
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
a mortal.

248
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Isn't it good?

249
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
The weather is getting colder.

250
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
What?

251
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
You want me to take off my coat for you?

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Are you feeling better?

253
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Much better.

254
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
So,

255
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
what happened?

256
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Let me think about it.

257
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
To make you so sad,

258
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I guess you failed your proposal today.

259
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Your beloved wife ran away with someone.

260
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Nonsense.

261
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I just met an old friend of mine.

262
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
No.

263
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
We are no longer friends.

264
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Friends?

265
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
What kind of friends?

266
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Why are we no longer friends?

267
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
We grew up together.

268
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
We practiced martial arts together.

269
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I thought it would go on like this for the rest of my life.

270
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
But then...

271
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Maybe you will still be friends.

272
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
It's impossible.

273
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Maybe I won't have such friends in the future.

274
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Then it's a matter of course.

275
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Of course?

276
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Someone once told me

277
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
that some people are as soft as water,

278
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
and have everything.

279
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
But some people are like fire.

280
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
They will only get more and more fierce.

281
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
People who are close to them will be hurt.

282
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
If they are forced to stay together,

283
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
they will only turn into ashes.

284
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Who told you that?

285
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Your friend?

286
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
It was me.

287
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
It was my foster father.

288
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
After he told me that,

289
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
I broke up with my best friend.

290
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
We became enemies forever.

291
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I must be a person who is also a person who is familiar with fire.

292
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Do you think we will become friends?

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
We are not friends anymore.

294
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Are we friends?

295
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Aren't we friends now?

296
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Ah Chun, thank you.

297
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
There's nothing to thank.

298
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
You brought me here in the middle of the night,

299
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
and even guided me here.

300
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
I really should thank you.

301
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Shisi,

302
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
you can't stay in Liu Zhou for long.

303
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Please leave early.

304
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Why did you say that?

305
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Did you hear anything?

306
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
There are some rumors in the army of You Zhou.

307
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
And it's not peaceful in Chang'an.

308
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
This place is heavily guarded.

309
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm afraid it will be too late sooner or later.

310
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Ah Chun,

311
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
you don't believe that I can protect myself?

312
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I...

313
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
You are too busy.

314
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Since you know that You Zhou is in danger now,

315
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
you can leave early

316
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
when you finish your business.

317
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Okay.

318
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Go back.

319
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
It's getting dark.

320
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I miss my father.

321
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
When can we go back to Chang'an?

322
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Please have a rest, Your Highness.

323
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I'll leave now.

324
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Don't go.

325
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't want to rest.

326
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
You just stay here.

327
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Why don't you say anything?

328
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I'll stay here as you told me to.

329
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
You look serious.

330
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
It's funny.

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
It's getting late.

332
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm alone.

333
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I really don't want to stay here.

334
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Goodbye.

335
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Don't go.

336
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Don't you listen to me?

337
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Look.

338
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
This is the rabbit I embroidered.

339
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
The rabbits others embroidered

340
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
are all red eyes.

341
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
The rabbit I embroidered is green eyes.

342
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Because the rabbit's eyes are grass.

343
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
That is a piece of freedom.

344
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I also want to be free.

345
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I want to be free.

346
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I want to be free.

347
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I want to be free.

348
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
I want to be free.

349
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I want to be free.

350
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I want to be free.

351
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Why are you so rude?

352
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Have you always been so cold?

353
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
You are also like this to your father.

354
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I don't think I've ever seen you smile.

355
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Will you smile?

356
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Hao Du.

357
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm talking to you.

358
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Are you deaf?

359
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm so sorry.

361
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
It's so sad.

362
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
You're still in this world.

363
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I had to be sent to the grassland by father to get married.

364
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Now I am brought here by you.

365
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
I don't even have a one-person talk.

366
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
I've never been alone.

367
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I miss my father.

368
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
I want to go home.

369
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
What are you doing?

370
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Let me go.

371
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Let me down.

372
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
It's so poisonous.

373
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Princess, please have a rest.

374
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I'll only sit here for this time.

375
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I won't leave.

376
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
hob住嶼

377
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Shisi, please take a rest early.

378
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
You too.

379
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,600
DAO typeeeee

380
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,320
Da Qian.

381
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,320
Why are you here?

382
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
I've been waiting for you all night.

383
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,600
I came out to see you

384
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
before you came back.

385
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,200
What's wrong?

386
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,640
Did you go on a date with that guy from the Eastern Palace?

387
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,920
Let's get to the point.

388
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,680
Wang Juan Guo sent someone to send me a letter of apology.

389
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,480
You go back first.

390
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,880
I have something to do.

391
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,840
Wait.

392
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,080
He's already back in his room.

393
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,480
You...

394
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,440
Hold it.

395
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,680
How much longer are we waiting for?

396
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,320
Come out now.

397
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
When did she come?

398
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,640
As of tonight.

399
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,480
She came?

400
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,240
帶路.

401
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
Happy birthday!

402
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,600
Happy birthday!

403
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Happy birthday!

404
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,200
Happy birthday!

405
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Let's go. Let's go.

406
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Let's go. Let's go.

407
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,200
Little Khan,

408
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,800
we're here.

409
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Happy birthday!

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
Happy birthday!

411
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
Happy birthday!

412
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Happy birthday!

413
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
Mister,

414
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
is this comfortable?

415
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
What are you doing here?

416
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,800
Look at what I'm doing here.

417
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
Do you want to play?

418
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I've never seen you have a girlfriend.

419
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
If you don't like it,

420
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
what's the point of coming here and looking at it?

421
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Hey!

422
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,920
I've always hated your

423
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,000
angry face since I was little.

424
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Let's go.

425
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What are you doing here?

426
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
I'm here to do what you're doing.

427
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
How do you know where I live?

428
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,200
It's your habit.

429
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
You won't live too close to the Governor's Residence

430
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,600
or too far away.

431
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,400
You won't live in a place where the flowers are blooming.

432
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
The rest of the place

433
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,400
is a place where you can't go.

434
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,600
How many places can I go to in the rest of the place?

435
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
You finally have a brain.

436
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
I can make you leave.

437
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,600
Fu Hai is taking me to Shuozhou.

438
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,600
Fu Hai is going to start the army.

439
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
Be a good dog.

440
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,600
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

441
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,400
Remember, you're the one who should leave.

442
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,200
You know a lot.

443
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
We grew up together.

444
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,400
You can't hide it from me.

445
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
That battle horse is mine.

446
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
But you agreed to the terms.

447
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,400
Then I should be the one to finish it.

448
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
You don't have the right to do it.

449
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Eagle Division, Special Qin, Ashile Tribe.

450
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
I'm here to order you.

451
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
The letter of surrender from Youzhou.

452
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
For Fu Hai.

453
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,600
You haven't opened it yet.

454
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,800
It's a dog's tail.

455
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
It's not that good-looking.

456
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
It's good-looking when you bite it.

457
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
All these years,

458
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,800
you're still the ugliest dog.

459
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,200
You like to steal other people's bones.

460
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,400
You don't understand.

461
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,800
It's more interesting to steal other people's.

462
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
Stealing yours is more interesting.

463
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
The king is getting more and more interesting.

464
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I want to see if he really has this kind of ability.

465
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
It's done.

466
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
Master.

467
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,600
You've been wandering here all morning.

468
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,800
Are you still worried about your uncle?

469
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I don't know.

470
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Ever since I was betrayed by the most trusted person,

471
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,600
I've been being cautious.

472
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,200
But now, we have no other choice.

473
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,000
Other than using uncle's power to live in Duoduo,

474
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
there's no other way.

475
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
But this thing must not be known.

476
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,000
Otherwise, if anything goes wrong with uncle,

477
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,400
the consequences will be unimaginable.

478
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,600
Then, master, let's not live in Duoduo.

479
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,200
I think this woodshed is not bad.

480
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Even if we don't live in Duoduo,

481
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,200
uncle will know we live here sooner or later.

482
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,000
But this thing must not be discovered.

483
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Then, master,

484
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,200
how about you give it to me first?

485
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
We'll live separately.

486
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Once you trust your uncle completely,

487
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll return it to you.

488
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Master, you won't not believe me, right?

489
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
Of course I believe you.

490
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,200
But I have some problems with my woodshed.

491
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,000
I think at this time,

492
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
it's right to be more cautious.

493
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,400
You can't put all the eggs in one basket.

494
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
You're smart.

495
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,400
Okay.

496
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll leave it to you.

497
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,400
Remember, there must not be any trouble.

498
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
The food and the people are here.

499
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't worry, master.

500
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,800
Even if this thing grows on my flesh,

501
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,000
it can be used. We can't lose it.

502
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,400
I have to go to Duoduo.

503
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
You stay here.

504
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
Sir, this is the guest's horse.

505
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,800
How can I explain if you take it away?

506
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
You're dead meat.

507
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
Sir, this is the guest's horse.

508
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Sir, you can't take it away.

509
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Sir, you took it away.

510
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
How can I explain to the guest?

511
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
Sir.

512
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
Sir.

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,400
How is it? What's going on?

514
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,600
I don't know either.

515
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
This horse is the guest's thing.

516
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
The guest went out early in the morning.

517
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,400
If he comes back later, this...

518
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
Wait.

519
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,400
This is not your horse.

520
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
It's ours now.

521
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,400
Why should I believe that it's yours now?

522
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Why should I believe that it's yours?

523
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
This is our horse.

524
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,200
Otherwise, how could it run away?

525
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,200
Don't waste time. Get lost.

526
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
What's wrong with A'Zhun?

527
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Forget it. I'll go to see Uncle Tang.

528
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You guys, listen to the orders at any time.

529
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,800
I've already arranged the things over there.

530
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
Remember, after you get the goods,

531
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll use the signal unit to train you.

532
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
You guys act immediately.

533
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
Yes.

534
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Go.

535
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,600
Go.

536
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
Go.

537
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,200
Tang Qin.

538
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Speak.

539
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,800
Today, Sher will be fighting with Wang Junkuo at the grass road.

540
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Also, it's said that Sher was given the Crown Prince's blessing

541
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
by Wang Junkuo in two days.

542
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,600
Crown Prince's blessing?

543
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,400
What's going on?

544
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,000
The letter of surrender to Father.

545
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,200
You haven't opened it yet?

546
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,000
Ya Luo, have you seen Wang Junkuo's letter of surrender?

547
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,200
How could I peek?

548
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
I was careless.

549
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,600
It seems that I underestimated Wang Junkuo.

550
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Crown Prince's blessing.

551
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Talk to me.

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,200
Although I didn't notice his power,

553
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,200
he also came and escapes after STEUILL.

554
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Nobody's going anywhere.

555
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,920
But I didn't realize when I saw this man came.

556
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
Hurry.

557
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Quickly.

558
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,200
Quickly.

559
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,400
You go first.

560
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,160
Don't wait for me.

561
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,880
General Wang is really punctual.

562
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,680
Why is it a little Khan?

563
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,560
You Ashile Tribe people are really interesting.

564
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,120
You see it and you change it.

565
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,600
I'm afraid there aren't many people

566
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,240
who do business like this.

567
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
You just need to know

568
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,640
that from now on, I'll make the call.

569
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,440
After all, I'm the little Khan of Ashile Tribe.

570
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm also the most trusted person of Yan Li Khan.

571
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
It's the best choice for you

572
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,080
to cooperate with me.

573
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,520
I don't care what happened

574
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,480
inside Ashile Tribe.

575
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,760
I don't care who I trade with.

576
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
I only care about the goods.

577
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,600
Little Khan is empty-handed.

578
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,760
How can I trust you?

579
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,280
Of course, you need to keep the precious goods properly.

580
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,960
It's not easy to be watched if you sneak out.

581
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,280
General Wang,

582
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,080
you can check the goods first.

583
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,760
When the plan is done,

584
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,560
the battle horse will be delivered as promised.

585
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,520
Isn't this the person who was in the inn

586
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,680
and took the horse?

587
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Why did the horse

588
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,720
have money with Ashile Tribe?

589
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
I want the goods.

590
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,720
He actually came to make a deal with Wang Junkuo.

591
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,880
Can you deliver the goods today?

592
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,200
General Wang is really a good temper.

593
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,000
With this horse,

594
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,640
I will be like a tiger.

595
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,880
In a few days,

596
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,280
Li Yuan will become my soulmate.

597
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,080
I will take over the city of Youzhou.

598
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,880
General Wang,

599
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,440
I can deliver the goods you want at any time.

600
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,880
But you haven't given me what I want.

601
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,560
There should be some pressure.

602
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,000
I will give you what you want soon.

603
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,400
Tell me.

604
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
I want the key to the treasury of Youzhou.

605
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,280
In case you cross the river and break the bridge.

606
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,040
And your token.

607
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,720
In case you are in trouble.

608
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,920
Okay.

609
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,360
Then,

610
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
Yanli Khan and I

611
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,480
are waiting for your good news.

612
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,240
Wang Junkuo wants to sell Youzhou to Yanli Khan?

613
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,480
No.

614
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,360
I have to save Uncle Tao.

615
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,920
Go.

616
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,160
Go.

617
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,440
Go.

618
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,120
Yongning,

619
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,720
why are you here so soon?

620
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,360
Uncle Tao,

621
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,240
Wang Junkuo betrayed you.

622
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,440
He went against Ashile Tribe.

623
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,760
And he wants to take Youzhou as his own.

624
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,000
And he killed you.

625
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,200
Yongning,

626
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,240
you don't know.

627
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,000
Junkuo is a man of great merit.

628
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,040
He is the most important man in Ashile Tribe.

629
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,520
It's ridiculous to say he wants to kill me.

630
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,000
I have been friends with him for many years.

631
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,760
And we are married.

632
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,040
Are you thinking too much?

633
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,120
Impossible.

634
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,440
I heard it myself.

635
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,240
Uncle Tao,

636
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,440
you go with me now.

637
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,640
If he comes here in advance,

638
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
we can't leave.

639
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,240
Go.

640
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,720
You...

641
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,880
You can't escape.

642
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,880
Go.

643
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Yongning,

644
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,400
I really underestimated you.

645
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,640
Wang Junkuo,

646
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,480
this is the Governor's Mansion.

647
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,840
How dare you!

648
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
All of you, get out.

649
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,960
How can you mobilize the soldiers of Youzhou?

650
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,040
You two

651
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,840
just wait for the reunion on the way to the imperial power.

652
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,600
Kill them.

653
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,440
Yes.

654
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,920
Chase them.

655
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,520
Yongning,

656
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,360
what should we do now?

657
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,320
The Governor's Mansion has been occupied by Wang Junkuo.

658
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,840
I...

659
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
I have no way out.

660
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,320
It's okay, Uncle Tao.

661
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,760
As long as they don't catch us,

662
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
everything will be in danger.

663
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,240
Why don't you go back with me

664
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,040
and find a place to hide?

665
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,480
Okay.

666
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,720
Yongning,

667
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,800
what's this place?

668
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,920
Where I live.

669
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,200
Where is he?

670
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,200
She?

671
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,120
Who is she?

672
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,200
I don't know.

673
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,720
But I think she's just an understanding and kind of beautiful.

674
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,360
What does she like about herself

675
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,160
is overusing her abilities.

676
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,840
Yes.

677
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,880
Some day,

678
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,800
she may visit you,

679
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,360
but others won't.

680
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,000
But then

681
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,960
she might lead you to her mascara trade.

682
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,040
Let's wait and see

683
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,560
until they can find a way to compete with us.

684
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,160
How can that be?

685
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,960
Who are you?

686
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
Do you have anything

687
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
to put with you?

688
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,800
I didn't say I was looking for something, Uncle Tang.

689
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,800
Ruoning.

690
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,520
Since we are escaping,

691
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,440
we must bring some valuable items.

692
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,920
Think about it.

693
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,680
Where is your companion now?

694
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,120
I don't know.

695
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,760
A'Dou.

696
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,920
Don't come back.

697
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,920
Ruoning.

698
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,160
It's too late.

699
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,560
If Wang Junkuo comes after us,

700
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,640
we'll be in trouble.

701
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,360
We came out from the back door.

702
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,840
Wang Junkuo can't come after us.

703
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,040
Did you

704
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,680
communicate with him in advance?

705
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
I'm so upset that I ate too much.

706
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,400
My legs are numb.

707
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,720
Master is back.

708
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,440
Your master is injured.

709
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm here to help you.

710
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,280
Yongning.

711
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,920
If I don't use this hard technique,

712
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,080
how can you come to save me?

713
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,400
To be honest,

714
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,160
I'm very touched

715
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,920
by what you've done these days.

716
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,880
Why?

717
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,920
Xiao Kehan offered me

718
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,960
the Crown Prince's happiness in two days.

719
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,680
If it wasn't for the situation,

720
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,320
I wouldn't have done it.

721
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,200
These people

722
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
want the Crown Prince's happiness?

723
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
They want us to give it to them in two days?

724
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,600
It seems that they want to use this to make trouble.

725
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,080
But, Duoduo.

726
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,720
I don't think Yongning

727
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,000
is a good man.

728
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,560
It seems that

729
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,160
we have to act.

730
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,200
Please explain to me.

731
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,840
After you get the goods,

732
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,200
I'll use the signal band to communicate.

733
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,560
You can act now.

734
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,960
Yes.

735
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,120
With this army of soldiers,

736
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,760
I must be like a tiger.

737
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,360
Today,

738
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,920
Li Yuan will become my soul.

739
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,560
I'll take the whole Youzhou City.

740
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,880
Yongning.

741
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,040
If you don't believe me,

742
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,600
how can I know

743
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,840
where the Crown Prince's happiness is?

744
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,640
How do you know it's with me?

745
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,000
I'll know it after I give the signal.

746
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,040
The wood sticks used in Chang'an are high-grade wood sticks.

747
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,440
The folk wood sticks you use

748
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,680
will open as soon as you use it.

749
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,720
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,600
I'm sorry.

751
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,520
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
