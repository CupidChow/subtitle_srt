1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is bitter

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Forget you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is the look of my stubbornness

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning in the dark night

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Climb the river of life and the river of hope

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yesterday was fine

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why are you injured today?

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did you meet an enemy?

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Young hero, you should eat something

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This will heal quickly

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have been in the world since I was a child

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have seen many people like this

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am sure that you must be in a bad mood

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or you are carrying a blood curse

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you fight with your enemy in the daytime?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you say one more word, I will kill you

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, no, no

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Young hero

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Master

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Although I don't know who you are

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are not a coward

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My A'Dou is lonely

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm afraid no one knows when he will die in the haze

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you can fight with your master

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's worth it even if you die

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Be careful

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's go

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Master

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Is there a soldier?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They come here from Rongwen Temple so soon

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Rongwen Temple

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I heard that the soldiers in Rongwen Temple were poisoned

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's you

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know I'm right

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And dare to fight against the soldiers

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Master, you are not a normal person

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Brother Du, what a surprise, we managed to take youQuechua down so late.

45
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,500
Brother stocks.

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,220
Why are you here, Master Fang?

47
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,760
I heard that

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,020
the Hippodrome's puffs were the best in Chang'an region.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,080
My wife just agrees to treat me there.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,480
I came over in person

51
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,460
to pay a visit to their national surprise.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
We just arrived,

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,480
I don't want any offence.

54
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,480
We'd just now heard from the Lord

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,700
that they'd be waiting on the ancestral ruins.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But the soldiers stopped him.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
After asking around,

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
it turned out that Brother Du was here to handle the case.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Brother Hang's news is really reasonable.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why is it on fire?

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It seems that I can't buy the cakes today.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Father.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Fang.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Brother Du.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You really want to keep the tiger as a danger?

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What do you mean by that?

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm really confused.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brother Du.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to leave now.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have to go home and report to my wife.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Goodbye.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Master.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why is it on fire?

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Father.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This fire is strange.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm afraid...

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't worry, father.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will investigate this matter.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No need to investigate.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If someone wants to control him,

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
he won't be left behind.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Could it be that the fire was set by Mr. Fang?

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't forget to guess.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There is no one in Pin Xiang House today.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The man of Eagle Division doesn't want to hurt the innocent, right?

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Send someone to save the fire first.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Master.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What should we do with such a big fire?

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Master.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wait for me.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Stop.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Master.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why is it on fire suddenly?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And the ladder.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It seems that someone prepared it for you in advance.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's going on?

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Master.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why don't you say anything?

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The fire burned my trace.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There won't be any traces of me.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did it help you?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Help me?

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mother died in Rongwen Temple.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will never take their life.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Rongwen Temple?

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Mrs. Jin is your mother?

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Too much information is not good for you.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No matter who you are,

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
you are my master.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Pin Xiang House is gone.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have no place to go in the future.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Master, let me follow you.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll say it again.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm not your master.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Follow me is like living on a knife.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't bother me.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Fang Yi.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Go to Jinjiao Camp and pass the order.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell them that the crime of treason is only for the sake of Jiancheng.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The other parties have nothing to do with it.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your Highness.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't want to choose the five gates.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't get involved again.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The land is barren.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There is no way to avoid it.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I hope that after the storm, the people of Tang will be safe.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Changge.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Didn't you say

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
you would take the 100 life-saving talismans I gave you?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But you haven't taken any yet.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are not home.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't get hurt.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm a Bodhisattva in the sky.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Please bless Changge.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
May she live a happy and peaceful life.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How is it, Tegin?

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The attack is lost.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The military chaos has been pacified by the King of Qin.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How can it be so fast?

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't expect that he was so bold.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He put the second king's party into the trap.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He just called for the order

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to resolve the military chaos.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I underestimated him before.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What should we do?

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We should go to the capital.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We should go to the capital.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We should go to the capital.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We should go to the capital.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What should we do?

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The King of Qin is not a good person.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's hard to stay in Chang'an

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and get something.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We should leave Chang'an

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and go to Youzhou.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Go to Youzhou?

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why?

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Chang'an has been in danger

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and has become a cannon.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Father has always been suspicious.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If I go back empty-handed,

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
my good brother will be in trouble.

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Youzhou is Chang'an's gate.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Only by going to Youzhou and getting something

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
can we stop him.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I understand.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Mr. Fang,

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going to find you in the mansion.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I've met Princess Yongan.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Princess?

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You may not know that

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
His Majesty has sent the King of Qin

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to be the Crown Prince.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Of course, you're Princess Yongan.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Princess,

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
why do you want to see me?

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mr. Fang,

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm here to ask you for help.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Changge?

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I know

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
that you hate Changge the most.

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I also know

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that you won't arrest Changge.

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mr. Fang won't arrest Changge.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So I came here today

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to tell you the truth.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How is Changge?

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Princess,

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
don't worry.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Princess Yongning

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
hasn't been caught yet.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I knew it.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I knew Changge would be fine.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Princess, don't worry.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The child that His Highness and Wei Zheng

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
gave her

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
took a lot of effort

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
on her.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How could she be

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
easily caught?

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's just

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
she has to suffer.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I understand

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that you want to set up the Crown Prince.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But I always think

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
that you can't make any move.

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's the reason?

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Tianjie Army's commander, Luo Yu,

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
has always been close with Li Jiancheng.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If he is rebellious,

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
it will be a big trouble.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And Li Changge, Li Jiancheng's niece,

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Li Changge

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
will be the...

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ke Ming,

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
it's the most important thing to be safe.

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If the court is suspicious,

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and the law of the law is broken,

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm afraid that it will repeat the same fate as Yang Di.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Have you heard of this saying?

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The words of the Queen of Rebellion

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
are not as good as the words of the King of Be.

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry for my mistake.

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's not surprising.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Wei Zheng said this.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Xuan Ling just recommended him to me.

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your Highness,

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Wei Zheng has always been stubborn.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm afraid it's not easy for you

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to put him in a bad position.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Stubborn?

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's exactly your taste.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sir.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This matter is about Chang'an's safety.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You must be cautious and not leave any traces.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Besides,

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
now is the time to ask for more things.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Send more people

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
to check all the gates.

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Don't let those fish

248
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
get mixed up.

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Please rest assured, sir.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I will do my best

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
to do this for you.

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What's going on?

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Just go.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Go.

255
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Go.

256
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Go.

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Go.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Go.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Go.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Go.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Do the officials in the Eastern Palace

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
need to hide

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
in the city of Chang'an?

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Move.

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
You can repair the ice grass in public in Chang'an.

266
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,080
What are you afraid of?

267
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,440
It's you.

268
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Why are you following me?

269
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,480
Following you?

270
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
You hit me.

271
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,560
What do you want?

272
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,720
People from the Eastern Palace.

273
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,600
Why can I get out

274
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
without a bodyguard?

275
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,160
None of your business.

276
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,760
What are you doing?

277
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm going to kill you.

278
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,760
Someone is coming.

279
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
What's that look?

280
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
You look like I'm bullying you.

281
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,120
From today,

282
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,440
we'll have the bodyguard guard the gate

283
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,400
and check the entrance and exit.

284
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,160
Yes.

285
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
If it weren't for that boy,

286
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,640
we would have left the city.

287
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's follow the steps.

288
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,600
Let's turn back.

289
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,720
Let's go.

290
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,080
It seems that

291
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,800
the bodyguard

292
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,080
is determined to sleep until dark.

293
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,600
Mr. Wang Du is still cold.

294
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
My father has been sick recently.

295
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
It's really inconvenient to see him.

296
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,600
Your father is not sick.

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
He is sick with a heart attack.

298
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
My father's temper

299
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,000
is not something others can say.

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,280
I apologize on behalf of my father.

301
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,080
Shuyu,

302
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,880
do you have siblings?

303
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,560
I have a third brother and a sister in my hometown.

304
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,160
I'm the only one who has a brother.

305
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
My brother and sister in my hometown

306
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
are with my mother.

307
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,240
My father is so stubborn.

308
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
He is like a tree in the forest.

309
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
If he is in a hurry,

310
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,840
he will be in trouble in the court.

311
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm afraid I pity your Wei clan.

312
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,920
Don't you have

313
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,880
the right to be so powerful?

314
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,160
I understand.

315
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,800
That's good.

316
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,240
You are the same age as my son Hao Du.

317
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
He is a man with a sense of propriety.

318
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,880
You can get along with him.

319
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,840
You will be like me when you see him.

320
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
Can you understand what I mean?

321
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,760
Li Shimin's talisman.

322
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,120
Could it be Mr. Wei?

323
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,760
Sir.

324
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,400
Mr. Du, please wait.

325
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
I will do my best to get the talisman.

326
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,280
I'm glad to hear that.

327
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,240
This is the talisman that His Highness gave you.

328
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,520
From now on,

329
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,760
you are a member of the Crown Prince's Mansion.

330
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,160
You can enter the palace gate

331
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,320
and meet the Crown Prince at any time.

332
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,440
Come on.

333
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,960
Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji's rebellion

334
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
has been eliminated.

335
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,160
His Highness asked His Majesty for permission to hold a grand banquet.

336
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
The rest can be exempted

337
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,680
if they are not allowed to hold a grand banquet.

338
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,320
His Highness is really generous.

339
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,120
Yes.

340
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,080
His Highness is the support of our people.

341
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,920
Brother Cheng.

342
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,240
It was you just now.

343
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,520
You caught me.

344
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,520
You can take me to the imperial court, right?

345
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,240
Why do you think so?

346
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,480
I won't do it no matter what.

347
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,080
Then why did you run away from Du Ruhui?

348
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,040
Why did you run away from Du Ruhui?

349
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Answer me.

350
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,400
Father is the Crown Prince's son-in-law.

351
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,840
Now the Eastern Palace is in trouble.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,040
Wei Jiayi is in danger.

353
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,520
He is at risk of being bullied at any time.

354
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,120
If I treat Mr. Du coldly,

355
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,800
how can I save my parents?

356
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,320
But, Brother Cheng,

357
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,560
this is the best way.

358
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
You have to believe me.

359
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
I don't believe anyone now.

360
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,240
Brother Cheng.

361
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,360
His Highness has ordered

362
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,680
that anyone who takes the initiative to return to the mansion will be exempted.

363
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,760
But only him will forgive me.

364
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,200
You are not guilty.

365
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,320
I am not guilty, too.

366
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
We are not guilty.

367
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
So you have to believe me.

368
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,680
I will go with you.

369
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,320
No one can accompany me now.

370
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,280
My mother is dead.

371
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,640
They are all dead.

372
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,280
Brother Cheng.

373
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,760
Oh, no. Yu Fu.

374
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,560
He often goes to the palace to see Yu Fu.

375
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,000
Why does he go back to the palace?

376
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
When I see Yu Fu,

377
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,520
he will act like an individual when he isESE is gone,

378
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,600
like an evolutionary process,

379
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,200
then only get seventh sense and the subtle Wah суп��게 dies.

380
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,800
What about gonna pull shit?

381
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,000
One of brother Feng's first words

382
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
for everyone.

383
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,040
Da Da's father

384
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,040
called himκαταυτε.

385
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I'm afraid that the recent emergency movement was also caused by them.

386
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,640
It's late now. You should go back first.

387
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,440
Yes.

388
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,400
Your Highness,

389
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,120
Your Highness!

390
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,440
It's me.

391
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,760
Congratulations, Your Highness.

392
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,560
His Majesty ordered me

393
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,800
to bring you

394
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,560
the Crown Prince's wedding.

395
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,440
My mother died in a tragic death.

396
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,960
The Eastern Palace is in a disaster.

397
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,760
So many people's blood

398
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,160
is for this thing.

399
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,000
Leave it here.

400
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,680
Yes.

401
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,080
If there's nothing else,

402
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,320
you may leave.

403
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,440
I'll take my leave.

404
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:03,000
Concubine Fighting

405
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,320
A divide seems to be a factor.

406
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,080
Is Object manager Marty B one?

407
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,460
It's usually Mr. furry.

408
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,500
Is something related to either thatли regression

409
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,020
or ret кож?

410
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,680
kun'er

411
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:49,260
Is object manager Marty A bolts in on Blunt's

412
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,080
A unit cornstarch

413
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,880
got a boot soup

414
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm here.

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,080
You can't hide it from others.

416
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,280
You can't hide it from me.

417
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,840
I've asked them to remember

418
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,440
that Princess Yongning is dead.

419
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,840
You killed Donggong and Xue Liu,

420
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,520
why are you willing to let me go now?

421
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,520
You're willing to let me go now?

422
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
I'm willing to let you go.

423
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,240
I'm willing to let you go.

424
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,760
I'm willing to let you go.

425
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
I'm willing to let you go.

426
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm willing to let you go.

427
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,440
Did you finally realize

428
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
how much you've done

429
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,080
to comfort yourself

430
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,480
and your conscience

431
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,400
because

432
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,280
I'm a maid who lost her identity?

433
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
I won't put you in danger.

434
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
Changge.

435
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,560
Stop.

436
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,200
Even if I have to sacrifice my life,

437
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
I'll avenge my mother.

438
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,160
Changge, let's go.

439
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,760
Your Highness.

440
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
You're fortunate to have an indomitable sleep,

441
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,560
you must cover yourself with blood.

442
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,880
Obedient thief.

443
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,440
You must not escape today.

444
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,400
Take Changge away,

445
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
before he hit the ground.

446
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
Take Li Changge away.

447
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,520
Yes.

448
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,640
Stop.

449
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,840
The knife belongs to her.

450
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,840
I'll use this knife

451
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,680
to take away the murderer

452
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
who killed my mother.

453
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,120
How dare you!

454
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,800
Guards.

455
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,000
Take the traitor to the death cell.

456
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Wait.

457
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,840
Take Princess Yongning

458
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,600
to the room

459
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,880
and take good care of her.

460
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,240
Your Highness.

461
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
You're making trouble for her.

462
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,320
Ke Ming.

463
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,360
I'm tired.

464
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,000
Don't tell anyone

465
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,520
about what happened today.

466
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Yes.

467
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,680
Take her away.

468
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,640
Go.

469
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,480
Go.

470
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,520
Father.

471
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,960
My father is well prepared.

472
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,680
I arranged alcoho hanging

473
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:19,220
around the

474
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,220
What should I do next?

475
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Send a double force

476
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,220
to guard the corners of the house

477
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,220
to create a fake image of the arm being scattered.

478
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,220
If he wants to escape,

479
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
we'll take him down.

480
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
Yes.

481
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
How did I find so many people to watch over me?

482
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,220
Mother, what should I do?

483
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Your Highness.

484
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Fang Guang, I can't sleep.

485
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Go down the street with me.

486
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Yes.

487
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
The King of Changge

488
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
How dare you?

489
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
I haven't given birth yet.

490
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
How dare you take the first step?

491
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,220
Your Highness,

492
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,220
aren't you waiting for someone to take the first step?

493
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,220
Those who know me

494
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
are not from the Fang family.

495
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Changge has never been

496
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
a girl who can be relieved.

497
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Your Highness, you have many affairs to do.

498
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
Why do you have to be so modest?

499
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Your Highness, you called me here

500
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
because you trust me.

501
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Your Highness, leave it to me.

502
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
He is your student.

503
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,220
You must help him to the end.

504
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
Yes.

505
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,220
The King of Qin was assassinated.

506
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,220
I didn't expect this guy to be so bold.

507
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Tegin, who are you talking about?

508
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,160
The guy who has us at the

509
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
court.

510
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
It seems he is not easy.

511
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Nonsense.

512
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Not only is he not easy,

513
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,220
his relationship with the King of Qin is extraordinary.

514
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,220
The King of Qin didn't lock him in the cellar,

515
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
but let him in the room.

516
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,220
It seems we are going to be friends with him.

517
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Friends?

518
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,220
The enemy of the enemy is a friend.

519
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
What?

520
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,220
I heard the servants talking in the early morning.

521
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
I was so shocked by the command of the leader.

522
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,220
I didn't hear where he was locked.

523
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Changge, what should we do?

524
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Changge.

525
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Mr. Fang.

526
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
Mr. Fang must know where Changge is locked.

527
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Mr. Fang.

528
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Jianzhou.

529
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,220
I was just going to find you.

530
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,220
We canShe comes out of nowhere at night.

531
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,580
Yeah.

532
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,620
I think!

533
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,580
I think it wants to summon the lapsing men in her tilted mind.

534
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,140
Yan Xinhua can't bear the senators' consider.

535
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,340
Don't be so foolish.

536
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,800
The

537
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,000
Yu Consolationаг are also scared.

538
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,820
Consort Yu!

539
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,980
What's wrong?

540
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,940
Are you ready?

541
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,100
I'm scared.

542
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,100
Don't be scared, Your Grace.

543
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,660
Think about what Mr. Fang has told you.

544
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,260
Just do as he says.

545
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,580
You'll be fine.

546
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,500
I believe in Mr. Fang.

547
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,020
Changge has been protecting me since I was a child.

548
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,620
Now,

549
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,380
it's my turn to protect him.

550
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,580
With his temperament,

551
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,460
he will be a good man in the next few days.

552
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,140
But His Highness told me to take good care of him.

553
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,780
Those guards are also worried.

554
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,860
No one can afford to

555
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,460
take the blame for the princess.

556
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,860
Only your appearance

557
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,580
can make Changge eat.

558
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,500
The guards are blocking you on the surface.

559
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,020
In fact, they hope you can show up.

560
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,860
So they can be responsible.

561
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,940
Remember, don't be afraid.

562
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,380
The guards will be relieved.

563
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,460
How dare you!

564
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,700
This is the princess.

565
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,780
Duke Du has told me

566
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,500
no one can come near the room.

567
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,780
Please don't make it hard for me.

568
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,460
I heard that

569
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,900
Princess Yongning has been

570
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,740
eating and drinking for 12 hours.

571
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,940
Father said to take good care of her.

572
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,700
If anything happens to her,

573
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,620
can you afford it?

574
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,620
Well...

575
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,860
Our princess just wants to

576
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,020
send her some food.

577
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
She'll be out soon.

578
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,940
Are you suspecting her too?

579
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,220
Please, Princess.

580
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,060
Wait for me here.

581
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,820
Changge.

582
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,580
Le...

583
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,340
Changge.

584
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,060
I'm Leyan.

585
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
Why did you come here?

586
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
Who told you to come here?

587
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,380
Don't let Changge know

588
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,820
that I told you to come here.

589
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,020
She won't take the blame.

590
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,140
What you have to do

591
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,020
is to show your weakness on purpose.

592
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,820
Provide her with some information

593
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,300
that can help her escape.

594
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,340
Let Changge

595
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,740
escape from the guilt.

596
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,340
This is what Changge can accept.

597
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
You can't let her

598
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
take the blame.

599
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,060
You can't let her

600
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,340
take the blame.

601
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,420
It's raining tonight.

602
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,300
It's cold.

603
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,100
I saw the guards

604
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,500
were back home.

605
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,340
So I brought you some hot soup

606
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
and snacks.

607
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,180
Have some hot soup.

608
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,220
How did you get in?

609
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,860
I'm the princess now.

610
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,340
They dare not stop me.

611
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,820
Your father killed my father.

612
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,300
You're the princess now.

613
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,540
Princess Yongan.

614
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,060
Changge.

615
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
It's not like that.

616
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,220
I don't want to be the princess.

617
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,620
From your room

618
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,620
to this incense powder,

619
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,980
you won't pass through the backyard.

620
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,020
How do you know

621
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,220
that there's no guard in the backyard?

622
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Who taught you that?

623
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,660
Changge is smart.

624
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,820
If she sees the weakness,

625
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,340
you can't hide it anymore.

626
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,900
Changge.

627
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,500
Leave now.

628
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,420
The back door is not locked.

629
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,940
The guard is driven away.

630
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,700
Go as far as you can.

631
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,940
Don't come back.

632
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,180
How can I believe you?

633
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,580
Is this your father's trap

634
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,340
or Du Ruhui's trap?

635
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,020
If you say that Princess Yongning

636
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,940
died in the sword

637
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,300
for the sake of the crime,

638
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,820
is it true?

639
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,060
Is it true?

640
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
Changge.

641
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,660
Do you really think I'm trying to harm you?

642
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,540
Mr. Fang...

643
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,460
Mr. Fang taught me.

644
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,340
He said you're a stubborn person.

645
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,220
How can you escape like this?

646
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,540
Fang Xuanlin.

647
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,140
Go back and tell Fang Xuanlin

648
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
that I'll figure out my own business.

649
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,780
Don't pity me.

650
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,540
I don't want to owe him anything.

651
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,540
The one who can really make Changge stop worrying

652
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,300
is your childhood sisterhood.

653
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,860
This time,

654
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,620
the one who can really save Changge

655
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,220
is actually you.

656
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,220
Changge.

657
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,020
This is the safe house I prayed for you.

658
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,740
You can keep it with you.

659
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,180
I can live in peace.

660
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,820
Safe house?

661
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,940
Your Qin's Mansion

662
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,540
has been open to kill the emperor of Eastern Palace.

663
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,740
Your father killed my mother and father.

664
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,140
You want me to live in peace?

665
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,260
I don't know, Changge.

666
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,940
I...

667
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,940
Princess Yongan.

669
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,020
From now on,

670
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,140
we'll meet in private.

671
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,100
We'll be alone.

672
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,820
Changge.

673
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,340
We're childhood besties.

674
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,820
Changge.

675
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,940
Besties?

676
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,820
How can I be a sister

677
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,620
to my daughter who killed my father's enemy?

678
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,300
I'll count to three.

679
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
Leave now.

680
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,300
Or you'll blame me for being ruthless.

681
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,780
Three.

682
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,620
Two.

683
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,420
One.

684
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,420
Changge.

685
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,140
I don't believe you're really going to drive me away.

686
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,500
If you kill me,

687
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,260
I can get rid of your hatred for Father

688
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,820
and you'll have no regrets.

689
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,740
Changge.

690
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm so sorry.

691
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,540
The late master.

692
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,620
I'm sorry.

694
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,020
I'm sorry.

695
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
I'm sorry.

696
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
I'm sorry.

697
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,220
I'm sorry.

698
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,380
I'm sorry.

699
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
I'm sorry.

700
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
I'm sorry.

701
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,860
Your Highness,

702
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,460
why aren't you talking?

703
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,580
Could it be

704
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,340
Mr. Fang's plan failed?

705
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,620
Your Highness.

706
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,660
His Majesty ordered me

707
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,100
to bring you

708
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,140
the Crown Prince's Evening Gifts.

709
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,420
Your Highness.

710
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,220
What's wrong?

711
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,380
Princess Yongan came to deliver the food.

712
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,300
I've checked.

713
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,060
Nothing wrong.

714
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,980
Princess Yongan?

715
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,580
Yes.

716
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,340
Princess?

717
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,340
Guards.

718
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,260
Yes.

719
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,300
Seal the red seal palace.

720
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,260
The rest, follow me.

721
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,260
Yes.

722
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,780
Princess.

723
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,420
Princess.

724
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,780
Princess.

725
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,780
Princess.

726
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,700
Call for the imperial doctor.

727
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,140
Your Highness.

728
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,300
Li Changge is the new consort of Tang.

729
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,100
Your Highness.

730
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,500
We found the princess's maid.

731
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,860
She fainted outside the study.

732
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,020
The study?

733
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,300
Hurry.

734
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,060
Go back to the study.

735
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,940
But she's gone.

736
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,300
Guards.

737
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,900
Get Li Changge back.

738
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,420
Yes.

739
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:05,980
Hurry.

740
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,420
Your Highness.

741
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,260
Your Highness.

742
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,020
Your Highness.

743
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,860
Your Highness.

744
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,700
Your Highness.

745
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,620
Your Highness.

746
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,620
Your Highness.

747
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,620
Your Highness.

748
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,620
Your Highness.

749
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,620
Your Highness.

750
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,620
Your Highness.

751
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
Your Highness.

752
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
Your Highness.

753
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Your Highness.

754
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Your Highness.

755
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Your Highness.

756
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Your Highness.

757
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,620
Your Highness.

758
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
Your Highness.

759
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,620
Your Highness.

760
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,620
