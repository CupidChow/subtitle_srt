1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Facing the distance

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,300
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
Forgetting you and me

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Memories are like a stronghold

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,300
I will use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
To return to the long hope

11
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Climbing the river of life and the wind of hope

12
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,300
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Episode 16

14
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Stop!

15
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Who are you? What are you doing here?

16
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
I'm a new worker.

17
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
I just passed by.

18
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Passed by?

19
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Then what's going on with the guards on the ground?

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
I don't know either.

21
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
When I just passed by, they were sleeping.

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
You're talking nonsense.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
If you don't tell the truth, I'll cut your tongue.

24
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,300
I...

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,300
A'Yi, why are you here?

26
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
I...

27
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
She's a slave under Khatun's control.

28
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Aunt A'Yi, thank you for coming in time.

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,300
Otherwise, I would have been rude to her.

30
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,300
By the way, I didn't do anything to her.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Please don't blame me.

32
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Don't run around anymore.

33
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Get up! Get up!

34
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Get up!

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
What's going on?

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
General, please forgive me.

37
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,300
We've been working all night.

38
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
I don't know why we fell asleep.

39
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
Such an important prisoner.

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
How dare you fall asleep?

41
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Come on, throw them away.

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Yes.

43
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
General, we dare not come here again.

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Keep the guards on the ground.

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Yes.

46
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
I'm Khatun.

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
We're both women from Central Plains.

48
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,300
I hope you can call me Princess Yicheng.

49
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
How did you know?

50
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,300
How did I know you're a woman?

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,300
People on the grasslands probably think we look alike.

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
I once was a woman.

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
How could I not recognize you?

54
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
What did you say?

55
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
I went to get some medicine and food.

56
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,300
I don't know how to call you.

57
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
I'm Li Changge.

58
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Go.

59
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
I'm Li Changge.

60
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
I'm Li Changge.

61
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Why do you want to save General Luo?

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
You misunderstood.

63
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
I was lost when I first entered the imperial prison.

64
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
That's why I entered the prison.

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Don't use these lies to cover me.

66
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
If I want to hurt you,

67
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,300
I won't let A'Yi risk his life.

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,300
You want to know why I want to save General Luo.

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
But I want to know more.

70
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Why do you want to save me?

71
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
I want to save you.

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,300
I don't know why you want to save me.

73
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
You must have suffered a lot.

74
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Otherwise,

75
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
a young woman like you

76
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
wouldn't be so alert.

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,300
But you want to stay alive here.

78
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,300
It's good to be vigilant.

79
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,300
I help you because I don't want to watch General Luo die here

80
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
and put you in danger.

81
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
You are the daughter of the royal family.

82
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
You married here for the sake of the country.

83
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Although it's been so many years,

84
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
you are a loyal citizen.

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
You are rich and well-educated in the Central Plains.

86
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,300
You are well-educated in the Central Plains.

87
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Changge is no longer with you.

88
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Now we are all from the Central Plains.

89
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
I was wrong.

90
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
I was wrong.

91
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Princess.

92
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,300
General Luo fought with Changge for many years.

93
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
General Luo was kind to our family.

94
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,300
I admired General Luo since I was a child.

95
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I treated him as my elder.

96
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
That's why I took the risk.

97
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Your father was Luo Yi's subordinate.

98
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Yes.

99
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
No wonder.

100
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
It's true.

101
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
When the Sui family was still alive,

102
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
General Luo helped the Zhuo family to protect the territory.

103
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
He is a loyal, brave and righteous hero.

104
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I admire him.

105
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,300
But I was not able to do it.

106
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,300
It's a great risk for you to keep it.

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Princess.

108
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Changge doesn't understand.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
It's our first time meeting.

110
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Why are you so honest with me?

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Because we are alike.

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
I heard what you did in Weishui.

113
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
If I'm not wrong,

114
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,300
you saved Tang Emperor.

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
I'm here to thank you for the people of the Central Plains.

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
You saved the Central Plains from the fire.

117
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Princess, please get up.

118
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Princess.

119
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Changge is in trouble.

120
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
If so,

121
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
why don't we find a way to save General Luo?

122
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Impossible.

123
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
The dam is like a huge cage.

124
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,300
No one can escape.

125
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
But you are a Khatun.

126
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
You can do more than me.

127
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
You don't understand.

128
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Although I'm a Khatun,

129
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
I'm a Han girl who is not trusted.

130
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Great Khan...

131
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
It's okay if you don't say it.

132
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
But...

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:26,580
We are both the

134
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Ayi,

135
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,580
take the things there.

136
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
I'm back.

137
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
I'm back.

138
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
I dare not go too far.

139
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
I just walked around.

140
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Luckily, I have some dry wood.

141
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
What are you drawing?

142
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Nothing.

143
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
It's too boring.

144
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Just draw whatever you want.

145
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
This is...

146
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,580
Wu, your family?

147
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
Yes.

148
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,580
Wu misses Ayi and Aniang.

149
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
I don't miss them.

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
I can't even remember their faces.

151
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
How can I remember?

152
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
This is their face.

153
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
So ugly.

154
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Just as ugly as you are now.

155
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
You are not that ugly.

156
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
I don't rely on my face to eat.

157
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
But you are so ugly.

158
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
I'm afraid you can't get married in the future.

159
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
You cough again.

160
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm not cold.

161
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
You do it yourself.

162
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
You are my brother.

163
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
You don't have to force yourself in front of A'jie.

164
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
Do you understand?

165
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Wu,

166
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,580
missing him is not a shameful thing.

167
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,580
I also miss my A'jie.

168
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
I tell you secretly.

169
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,580
I was angry with him before.

170
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Why?

171
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Because he is always busy.

172
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
He didn't have time to see me.

173
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
But now I know

174
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,580
although he is my A'jie,

175
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
he is not only my A'jie.

176
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Now he is in a mess everywhere.

177
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
He must be very tired.

178
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
I don't know if he has a good rest.

179
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Then why didn't he come to you?

180
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
He must have been looking for me.

181
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
But the world is so big.

182
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
How can he know where I am?

183
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
So,

184
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,580
as long as we stick together,

185
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
everything will be fine in Luoyang.

186
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Then I will take you to Chang'an

187
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
to see my A'jie.

188
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Chang'an?

189
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
That is my A'jie's hometown.

190
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
When we arrive in Chang'an,

191
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
we don't have to

192
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
compete with people in the world.

193
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I can give you whatever you want.

194
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Then I will teach you

195
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
the chess, literature, and poetry.

196
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
Music, law, poetry, and wealth.

197
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
If you really want to learn martial arts,

198
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,580
I will help you to teach martial arts.

199
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,580
But if you like to be free,

200
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
I will take you to see Chang'an.

201
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
I will take you to see Chang'an.

202
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,580
The flowers are beautiful.

203
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
The mountains are beautiful.

204
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
As long as we arrive in Luoyang,

205
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
everything will be fine.

206
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
I hope one day,

207
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,580
the world will be peaceful.

208
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
The world will be peaceful.

209
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
We will be together forever.

210
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
I haven't seen anyone

211
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
from my hometown for a long time.

212
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
Princess.

213
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Do you want to go home?

214
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
I can't go back.

215
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
But you still have a chance.

216
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
You can go back to the Central Plains

217
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,580
and our hometown.

218
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
If that day really comes,

219
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
remember to tell me

220
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
if he has changed.

221
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
I will tell you.

222
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
I will tell you.

223
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
I will tell you.

224
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,580
I will tell you.

225
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Did he change?

226
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Okay.

227
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
I promise you.

228
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Child.

229
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,580
Don't act rashly.

230
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,580
Living is the most important thing.

231
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Thank you.

232
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
Go back.

233
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Most importantly,

234
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
you have to tell me

235
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
why are you going back?

236
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
What are you doing in the manor?

237
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,940
He asked me to stay with him in the tent.

238
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,940
I can't walk around freely.

239
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,780
I can only come out to see you.

240
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,020
Don't take the risk.

241
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,180
I'm fine.

242
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,300
Someone changed the medicine for you.

243
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,820
I...

244
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,780
It's Princess Yicheng.

245
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,300
She also gave me some food and medicine.

246
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,740
Brother Cheng.

247
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,020
In the imperial court,

248
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,460
except me, don't believe anyone.

249
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,100
Even if she's from the Central Plains.

250
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,020
Okay.

251
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,580
Kuri is here.

252
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,500
I'll find a way to get you out.

253
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,180
Sun.

254
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,340
General Luo Yi is here.

255
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,260
Brother Cheng, are you crazy?

256
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,940
I can't just ignore General Luo.

257
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,540
It's impossible for you to save Luo Yi.

258
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,860
Then I have to fight to the death.

259
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,500
I hope you can stop cursing me.

260
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,700
Yicheng.

261
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,100
Yicheng.

262
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,620
You have to live with me.

263
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm going back.

264
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,660
Good.

265
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,740
That's good.

266
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,740
Good.

267
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,300
Father, who is she?

268
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,660
She has a crush on the most dear to you,

269
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,060
the operate on Great Khan.

270
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,260
So?

271
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:27,980
Look.

272
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
The End

273
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Khan

274
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
How dare you!

275
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
This is not a place

276
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,020
where you can come and go as you want

277
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I haven't been here for three months

278
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
and I can't enter this tent

279
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Khan is really heartless

280
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
How are those

281
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,020
old men and widows

282
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
over there?

283
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Khan, don't worry

284
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
I've taken care of

285
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
Empress Xiao and Prince Xiao

286
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
very well

287
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,020
I won't give you any more trouble

288
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
Khan

289
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
When I lost to you

290
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
and won back Empress Xiao and Royal Descendant

291
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,020
I promised to treat you well

292
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
But now...

293
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Now I'm Khan

294
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,020
not Shule

295
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
You want to use Shule's rules

296
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,020
to control me?

297
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,020
I dare not

298
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,020
But Khan, if you do this

299
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,020
I'm afraid you'll lose

300
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
the reputation of Dingxiang people

301
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020
Dingxiang people are just tens of thousands

302
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,020
and they are all from the Central Plains

303
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,020
It doesn't matter if they're lost or not

304
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
I think you're afraid

305
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,020
you'll lose Shule's heart

306
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
No

307
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,020
I haven't blamed you

308
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,020
I haven't asked for

309
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
the good things you did in Nanzheng

310
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,020
I'm thankful for your kindness

311
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,020
I'll leave now

312
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,020
and don't disturb you

313
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Khan

314
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,020
I've been running all the way

315
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
and my bones are about to fall apart

316
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,020
Look, I've just had one cup

317
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Yicheng

318
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Didn't you hear Madam Jinse

319
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
saying she was thirsty?

320
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I heard it

321
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
You didn't come to get the wine

322
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
Are you going to

323
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,020
let me come personally?

324
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
I'm sorry

325
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Thank you, Khatun

326
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Why are you still standing there?

327
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Look at her

328
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
Useless

329
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
You can't even pour the wine

330
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,020
What's the use of keeping your face?

331
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,020
You're pulling my face again

332
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
You gave this person to me

333
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm not your enemy

334
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
I'm your enemy

335
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
I'm your enemy

336
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
I'm your enemy

337
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm your enemy

338
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
You gave this person to me

339
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Now

340
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,020
you're pulling my face again

341
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Get out

342
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
Sister

343
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,020
I'm leaving

344
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
You look pretty

345
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
Khatun

346
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
You're too much

347
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Khatun, are you okay?

348
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Don't take it to heart

349
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
You're always the only one for Khatun

350
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
General Jiao Shiqing is joking

351
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm fine

352
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
Go and call Changge over

353
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Don't let anyone find out

354
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Go

355
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
Khatun

356
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Who hurt you?

357
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
Is it Great Khan?

358
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
I called you here

359
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
not to care about me

360
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
How could Great Khan hurt you?

361
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
You're Khatun

362
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I helped you save General Luo

363
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Why?

364
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
I've had enough

365
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
I've had enough of this place

366
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
I've had enough of this place

367
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,020
I've had enough of this place

368
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
I've had enough of this place

369
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
I've had enough of this place

370
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
People only know

371
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
I'm the princess of Sui

372
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
For the sake of justice

373
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm willing to marry into this place

374
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
But no one knows

375
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
what kind of life I've lived

376
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
for so many years

377
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
Thirty years ago

378
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
I married Qi Ming Khan

379
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
He died

380
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
His son Shi Bi Khan

381
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
married me

382
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
Later

383
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
it was Shule Khan

384
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
and then

385
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
it was Yan Li

386
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
I'm also a woman from Central Plains

387
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
I have my own books

388
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
But now

389
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
I can't stand this

390
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
I can't even

391
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
see my own son

392
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
You have a son?

393
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
You've seen him?

394
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
Shen Er?

395
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
Shou Er?

396
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
But I can only be

397
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
Yan Li's Khatun

398
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
But he's my child's mother

399
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Great Khan made Shen Er

400
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
make a bet

401
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
If he sees me secretly

402
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
he'll make God of Heaven curse me

403
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
and make me die of illness

404
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm your son

405
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Chang Ge

406
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Shen Er

407
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
is a good kid

408
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
Although he's impatient

409
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
he won't really harm you

410
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Listen to me

411
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
The Kulitai Conference is the whole grassland's

412
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
holy meeting

413
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
All the leaders will come

414
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
Great Khan will receive

415
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
the nobles in person

416
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
The conference is over

417
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
Tomorrow morning, Great Khan will go out

418
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
with the leaders

419
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
By then

420
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
What are you doing in Khatun's tent?

421
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
I didn't expect

422
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
you've bewitched Ashile Sun

423
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
and Mimi Kulitai

424
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Now even Khatun is bewitched

425
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
You're really

426
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
being too careful

427
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
What do you want to say?

428
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
Why are you getting close to him?

429
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Shen Er

430
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
He misses you

431
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
He misses you so much

432
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
He misses you so much

433
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
He misses you so much

434
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
You don't deserve to mention him

435
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
He's in a bad state now

436
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Shut up

437
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
You... You don't have a marital bond

438
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
You're a woman

439
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
Don't worry, I'm fine

440
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
But I'll be back to Eagle Division

441
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
I see

442
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
I was wondering

443
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,020
why Mimi fell in love with a man so quickly

444
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,020
How could Ashile Sun

445
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
be so kind to a man?

446
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,020
What do you want?

447
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Your life is in my hands now

448
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
If you don't want Ashile Sun

449
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
to see your body, just be good

450
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Khatun told me you're a good kid

451
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
You won't harm others

452
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
I don't care what I do

453
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
If Great Khan knew

454
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Ashile Sun brought a woman back

455
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
He knew archery and even framed my master

456
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
What do you think

457
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Great Khan would do to Ashile Sun?

458
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
What do you want?

459
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
What do I want?

460
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,020
What do you want?

461
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,020
Great

462
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
Great

463
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Come on

464
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,020
Open your mouth

465
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
I'll buy you a drink

466
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Come on

467
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
Come on

468
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
I'll buy you a drink

469
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Come on

470
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
Come on

471
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Come on

472
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
Come on

473
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,020
Come on

474
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,020
The Kulitai Conference

475
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
is the holy meeting of our grasslands

476
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
You're invited

477
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
I'll drink to you

478
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Thank you Great Khan

479
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Thank you Great Khan

480
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
Great Khan

481
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Why isn't Sher coming?

482
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Great Khan

483
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
He must be delayed

484
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
I'll go and check

485
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
Great Khan

486
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
I'm late

487
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Please forgive me

488
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
You're late

489
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Sit down

490
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
Sit down

491
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
Why are you hiding?

492
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Pour me some wine

493
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
Bring it

494
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,440
Give me another

495
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
Sher

496
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
Look at the woman

497
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
you have

498
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,260
You do look like a good man.

499
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,940
Your Highness,

500
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,300
she's just a servant in the tent.

501
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,380
She doesn't have any new ideas.

502
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,660
But today,

503
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,420
I asked her to dress up

504
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,700
to be a servant in the tent.

505
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,300
You're interesting.

506
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,100
But this female servant

507
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,180
looks familiar to me.

508
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,700
When did

509
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,780
you get such a beauty?

510
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,540
I don't have enough beauties like Khatun.

511
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,300
What kind of beauties do you want?

512
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,940
You're so petty.

513
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,700
You dare to say anything.

514
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,980
Am I wrong?

515
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,020
Don't be greedy.

516
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,820
Khatun was the most beautiful woman

517
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,380
in Central Plains.

518
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,580
Khatun, am I right?

519
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,300
Enough.

520
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,220
You're not allowed to talk here.

521
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,180
Come on.

522
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,140
Drink.

523
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,980
You.

524
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,860
Go to my brother, Asun,

525
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,140
and toast.

526
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,060
Don't you understand?

527
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,420
How is it?

528
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,900
Do you think the wine tastes better?

529
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,260
Father,

530
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,380
I want to toast you.

531
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,180
I want to ask for a reward.

532
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,860
Asun, what do you want?

533
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,300
Just tell me.

534
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,820
Except for the people under Khatun's tent,

535
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,940
I can give you anything.

536
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,140
Today is the Kulitai Festival.

537
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,860
I want to participate in the duel according to the custom.

538
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,220
I want to challenge Sher.

539
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,420
Okay.

540
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,700
If I win,

541
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,380
give me that maid at his side.

542
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,020
You brothers

543
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,060
spent your time

544
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,460
on a price that Khanfalasde agreed.

545
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,860
In our Ashile Tribe,

546
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,940
you're the best

547
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
among yourself and others.

548
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,620
Are you willing to?

549
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,540
Your Majesty,

550
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,700
since Sun Te Qin is a saint,

551
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,940
I can't refuse.

552
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,780
But I also want to add something.

553
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,140
What do you want?

554
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,420
Since Ashile Sun wants the maidservant in my tent,

555
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,740
if I win,

556
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,340
I want the maidservant

557
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,900
named Mimi Guli in your tent.

558
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,700
Mimi?

559
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,900
Good.

560
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,340
The men on my grassland

561
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,260
fight for the beauty.

562
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,700
That's also the beauty of my Ashile Tribe.

563
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,740
Approved.

564
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,740
I remember you two

565
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,060
fought for a little wolf

566
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,300
when you were children.

567
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,100
After so many years,

568
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,300
you two have learned to steal women.

569
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,780
You two

570
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,940
are the lions on this grassland.

571
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,060
It's the glory of my Ashile Tribe.

572
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,220
Warriors

573
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,340
