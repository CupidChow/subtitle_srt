1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has gone through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to return to the long yearning with him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Climbing the river of life, never forget the crazy

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Such a ridiculous thing, why did father agree to it?

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you afraid of?

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Didn't you say that no matter who the warrior is, they can compete?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You mean that the people of Tang can also fight?

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's wrong? Are you still worried that your brother Shuyu won't dare to compete?

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Leyan

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, Ashile is a good fighter, right?

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What if no one can beat him?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Tian Ji can win the King of Qi with the top and the middle level

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can also beat him

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I will go to school

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why?

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Boring

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Brother Chang, it's okay, just forget it

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You just help Leyan fight, you win that thing first

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then lose to Wei Shuyu, this thing will work

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wei can win me? How is that possible?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So I told you to lose to him

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why?

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What why?

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You don't marry Leyan, it's natural that you lose to him

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Brother Chang, you don't have to fight because of me

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Anyway, I can't lose to that boy in front of you

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Forget it, I won't talk to him

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Brother Chang

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Brother Chang

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Brother Chang

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You don't have to force your friend or brother Shuyu

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If he has me in his heart, he will figure out a way on the stage

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If he doesn't have me in his heart

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Then there is no way

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There are so many good boys in Tang

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Will I not be able to marry him?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Leyan

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You really make me look at you

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Forget it

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Since I can't beat Shuyu, I can just take care of his physical strength

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Come

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can't see

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can't see

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Continue continue

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Li Chengqian

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's you

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Li Changge

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Brother

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I haven't told you last time when I was in Luoyang

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ok

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Guards

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Li Chengqian

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sister

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All of you go out

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You come here

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sister, calm down

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can't beat me anymore

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will go back and apologize to Aye

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You come here

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No no

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't let go

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's them

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They brought it here

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No no no

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Today you are unlucky

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I met me alive

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But for the sake of the jiuxiang stone

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I won't bother you

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But if in the future

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There is a rumor that Princess Yongning is still alive

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You should know the consequences

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why are you so bold?

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Li Chengqian, you are too young

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't know many things

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What they are playing now is what I played in the past

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Tell him

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What did I do in the past?

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This royal family

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is the queen of the east

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Once because of the robbery of the princess

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Three bones were pierced by this Yongniang

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Later, this royal family

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Was saved by the queen

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But not yet married

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The son of Chen Yuan

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is sick of being released in the east

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yongniang let him soak in the pond for two days

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When the young man

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Has been practicing Buddhism

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He is released

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
When I was young

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was disrespectful to Princess Yongan

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yongniang beat me every time

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In order to escape

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I had to practice this body

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are Er Pang

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The one who bullied me since I was a child

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I am not a child

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I am not a child

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Li Chengqian, come here

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He has been playing with you all the time

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why should I tell you?

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Come here

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want him to be at the wedding tomorrow

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To save your sister

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Zhang Sunjing is not like us

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He was pulled in today

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You saw it

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He was sitting and watching

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He didn't play anything

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Sister, you have a good taste

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can testify

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He is a good person

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's you

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Princess Yongan will be married tomorrow

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You need to defeat Ashile

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't let our princess be taken away

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Father

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I am afraid that I will not be able to teach you

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't worry

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will teach you

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I will teach you

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't say such a sad thing

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We will find the best doctor to treat you

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know my body

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You need to be filial to the emperor

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't worry, father

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will be filial to the emperor

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There are many ways to be filial

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Tomorrow, fight with Ashile Tribe

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can't lose

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I know your mind

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can think about it yourself

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you think you are not worthy

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can choose to win first

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then lose to other Gungsun

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can also win in the end

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you didn't raise me

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I am just a wild child on the road

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How can I dare to marry the princess?

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I have never considered anything for myself

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You don't have to blame me

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can do what you want

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't be afraid

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's also the way to make a living

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The prince is here

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He is here

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sun can't come

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Of course he can't come

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If he comes, he will win

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But if he wins, he will marry the princess of Tang

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I am already forced enough just to marry you

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And a princess of Tang

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's impossible

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Changge

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why didn't the emperor of Tang come?

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He just needs to know the result

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Result

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Welcome the chief warrior

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Ashime Jiaokehan

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Welcome

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are there any emissaries here who want to fight?

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If no one wants to fight

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then I will fight

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why did Zhixi go up?

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They are the most opposed to the alliance

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They are the most opposed to the alliance

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Does he want to surrender to Tang?

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ashime is very brave

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He is the first warrior of the grassland

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He should marry the princess of Tang

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Zhixi will go to the palace to help Ashime

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And marry Xin Kedun

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Look at Zhixi

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ashime wins

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You are so weak

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If you don't want to ally with Tang

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then go back to the desert

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't come to save our face

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Princess, I am not against Jiaokehan

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If someone in the desert can defeat Ashile Jiaokehan

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then please come up

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No one dares to fight in the desert?

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You want to ally with Tang

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because no one can fight

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can only rely on Tang

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But now the princess of Tang wants to marry Jiaokehan

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You don't look at the situation

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You still want to follow the princess of the desert

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
To jump up and down

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have to beat you down today

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Don't be so hard on him

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Sit down

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why are you so late?

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You are wearing this

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't touch me

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I am here to fight

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have to have a fighting style

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why are you laughing?

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Who are you?

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you laughing at me?

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
She is the princess of the Tujia in the south

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
She is one of us

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Zhenzhu, this is the crown prince of Tang

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The crown prince is here

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am here to see you

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I am here to see you

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The crown prince is so handsome

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I am so happy

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What are you wearing?

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How can the princess of Yongan come to such an occasion?

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I also want to see what my ending is

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's okay, Changge

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No one will find out

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You two are real sisters

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Forget it, it's too late

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go in

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is everyone in the desert?

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then the wedding alliance of Tang

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Good morning, Your Highness

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Welcome, Your Highness

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Your Highness

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You are the one

233
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
who wants to marry my sister

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ashile, Xiao Kehan

235
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Your Highness

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Your Highness

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is my son

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Ashile, you are so polite

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I won't avoid it

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
After all, it's not a family

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You should be polite

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Did the crown prince bring someone to fight?

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is it a family?

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I will know in a while

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Brother Zhangsun

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I will leave my sister to you

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I am willing to do it

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I am very close to you two

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You are allowed to go to the coffin with me

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Thank you, Your Highness

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Chengqian

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Can you do it?

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Sister, don't worry

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Brother Zhangsun is the most capable of my mother's nephew

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If he can't do it

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The rest of them will be no good

257
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He is so good

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He is so good

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He is so good

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He is so good

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ashile, Xiao Kehan, win

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What?

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We have finished?

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Anyone else to challenge Xiao Kehan?

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It seems that no one dares to challenge

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why are you so anxious?

267
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Marriage is a big thing

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You should think about it

269
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Think about it

270
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Since the crown prince has spoken

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I will give you some time to think about it

272
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you want to go to the coffin?

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I didn't expect Zhangsun Jing to be so careless

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What should I do now?

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't want my sister to marry into such a bitter place

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And I hate this Sher

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't want him to be my brother-in-law

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Leyan, don't worry

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Shuyu will come

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Mr. Wei is here

281
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What happened?

282
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Mr. Wei is here

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's good

284
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Shuyu

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Shuyu

286
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Leyan

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I have something to tell you before going to the coffin

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I have thought about it for a long time

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I decided to tell you

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I will go to the coffin

291
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You are my sister

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I will never allow you to marry into the grassland

293
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Protect is protected

294
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't lie to you

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
After the coffin is successful

296
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It doesn't mean we are going to get married

297
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Leyan

298
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Now you are so brave

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I am very happy

300
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So I can't be so weak

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I just hope you can understand my brother's heart

302
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I am sorry

303
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I understand

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Since Shuyu doesn't want to be the consort

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Then you don't need to go to the coffin

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What Leyan wants

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Is not a victory of fighting

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But a person who really loves me

309
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I understand it

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Not brother and sister

311
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But a couple who can be together for a long time

312
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A couple

313
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The man standing on the coffin

314
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He went to the coffin because he loved me

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Not because he protected me

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If he just protects me

317
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Leyan doesn't need it

318
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Even if he wins

319
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
For me, it's just

320
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Humility and insult

321
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But today's coffin

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The coffin

323
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not about Shuyu

324
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Leyan is not the old Leyan

325
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Your own business

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can handle it well

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you brother Shuyu

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Leyan

329
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Leyan

330
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What happened to you

331
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Did he bully you

332
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm looking for him

333
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I am

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't want to force him

335
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't want to wrong myself

336
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You all made it clear

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Very clear

338
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll go find Sun

339
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No need

340
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Why not

341
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't want to force anyone

342
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is not forcing

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is about your life

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's get through this first

345
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You wait for me

346
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Changge

347
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Brother Sun

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You are here

349
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hurry up and go up the stage

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm here to watch

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What to watch

352
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm here

353
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Obviously want to help you

354
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Still talking about heart

355
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't help others

356
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Leyan is not someone else

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Brother Sun, don't say it first

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't say it

359
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Although I don't want you to come on stage

360
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But now there is no way

361
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You hurry up

362
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
How is it?

363
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Still no one dares to come on stage?

364
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If no one challenges the whole son

365
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Then the whole son and the marriage agreement of the Tang Dynasty

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's settled

367
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hurry up

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Brother Sun

369
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's time to take the initiative

370
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let's fight first

371
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The future will be solved later

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's right

373
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Even if Changge agrees

374
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I won't allow it

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What's going on?

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I have given you enough time to consider

377
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I count the last three numbers

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
If no one comes on stage

379
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This matter is settled

380
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Three

381
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sun

382
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Brother Sun

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Look at his proud look

384
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Don't you want to beat him?

385
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Two

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Hurry up and jump off

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I

388
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
One

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Sun

390
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And me

391
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Hao Du

392
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Who are you?

393
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Can beat your little clan in the Tang Dynasty

394
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Good job

395
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I

396
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I

397
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I

398
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hao Du

399
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hao Du

400
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hao Du

401
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay

402
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay

403
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If you don't beat me, I'll lose

404
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I admit defeat

405
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hao Du

406
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't beat me

407
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I admit my life

408
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay

409
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Hao Du

410
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I admit defeat

411
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Enough

412
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You don't believe in fate

413
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Enough

414
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I

415
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't waste time

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just fight

417
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hold him

418
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Hao Du

419
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Hurry up

420
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Sun

421
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Stop fighting

422
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The Tang warriors win

423
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Great

424
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So cool

425
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Great

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So cool

427
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You guys

428
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's a man

429
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Worth a toast

430
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I admit defeat

431
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll go back to the palace and report to His Majesty

432
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Goodbye

433
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Good win

434
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I

435
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I won

436
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm going home

437
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm going home

438
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm going home

439
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I know

440
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You have found Leyan

441
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And told him clearly

442
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes

443
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't want to hurt him

444
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You did the right thing

445
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
There should be no lie

446
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But if Hao Du is not here today

447
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It will be hard to end

448
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Even if Hao Du didn't come

449
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm ready to fight on stage

450
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I can't let Ashile Tribe take Leyan away

451
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And then ask His Majesty for forgiveness

452
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I believe

453
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
As long as we give Leyan some time

454
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He will figure it out

455
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't expect our relationship

456
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
To go back to the past

457
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But at least you and Leyan

458
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Must be fine

459
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
No matter when

460
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm still your brother

461
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Thank you, Shuyu

462
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Shuyu

463
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
There is one thing you have to pay attention to

464
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The Khatun from Ashile Tribe

465
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Tang has to be careful

466
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sorry

467
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm sorry

468
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm sorry

469
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm sorry

470
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm sorry

471
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm sorry

472
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm sorry

473
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm sorry

474
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm sorry

475
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm sorry

476
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm sorry

477
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm sorry

478
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm sorry

479
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm sorry

480
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm sorry

481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm sorry

482
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm sorry

483
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm sorry

484
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm sorry

485
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm sorry

486
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm sorry

487
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry

488
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm sorry

489
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm sorry

490
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sorry

491
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm sorry

492
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm sorry

493
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm sorry

494
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Why did you go to the stage?

495
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I

496
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm afraid Ashile Tribe

497
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Will bully our Tang's staff

498
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So

499
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You are the same as Shuyu

500
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Going to the stage or not

501
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Is for the sake of Tang's reputation

502
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Not because of me

503
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Hao Du

504
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Tang's reputation

505
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I, Li Leyan, will find a way to get it back

506
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't need your help

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
No

508
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Actually I

509
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I just don't want to see you

510
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Be forced to marry someone you don't like

511
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I don't want to see you

512
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't want to see you

513
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
This is a competition

514
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Whoever wins, I will marry

515
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Now you won the stage

516
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I will marry you as promised

517
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So you think

518
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Do you think you are the one I like?

519
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I know who you think of

520
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You don't have to worry

521
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This is not a matter of her

522
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I will go to the emperor tomorrow

523
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
To report everything

524
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You are so smart

525
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Never thought of marrying me

526
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I have no father

527
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
How can I live without a home?

528
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Why are you always in front of me

529
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So respectful of your predecessors

530
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You can have a bigger role

531
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Why do you have to work hard for me?

532
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Because you deserve it

533
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But I

534
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Do you want to know

535
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What you are in my eyes?

536
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
When I first saw you

537
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I thought you were like an ice cube

538
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Your face is cold

539
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Your heart is cold

540
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Then I was afraid of you

541
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I dare not

542
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't want to be close to you

543
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then

544
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You want to fight and kill Changge

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I was more afraid of you

546
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't want to see you

547
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I don't want to see you

548
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I hate you

549
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I think I was wrong

550
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You are not a groom

551
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You have no heart at all

552
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I fled from Beijing to Luoyang

554
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You saved me

555
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You hugged me

556
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The moment you said you would take me home

557
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm not afraid of you

558
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But I still

559
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I rely on you more and more

560
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I started to feel it slowly

561
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Your heart is warm

562
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Only when I stay with you

563
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I feel very at ease

564
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Very comfortable

565
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In fact, I gradually know

566
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What you do

567
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
A lot of things

568
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's not up to you

569
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
A lot of words

570
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
A word is not enough

571
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Much better

572
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
In fact, you are a good person

573
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But you like to hide your emotions

574
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You are always making it difficult for yourself to satisfy others

575
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Today on the stage

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I saw you being beaten down again and again

577
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm really afraid

578
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Because I'm afraid I'll never see you again

579
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I can't see you again when I think about it

580
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'll ask you one last time

581
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Why did you go on the stage

582
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Shang Leitai

583
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Shang Leitai

584
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't want to see you sad

585
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I also want to fight for myself

586
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Fight for what

587
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Princess, you used to say that

588
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You are a daughter of a thousand golds and let me protect you

589
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I used to protect you as a guard

590
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But in the future

591
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What's the future

592
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
in the future

593
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I want to protect you as a husband

594
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Love is like a bone

595
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Use my life to stab the pearl

596
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Ask what love is

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Escape from the world

598
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You are now

599
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
How can you be so bold

600
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm sorry, princess

601
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You think I didn't say

602
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I didn't say you want to play

603
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I don't want to

604
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Let you not

605
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You have to be careful

606
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
If the care is not good

607
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Leave the ice

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
How to protect me in the future

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Protect me

610
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Use all your strength to fight

611
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm not afraid of retreating

612
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
How much love is needed

613
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
To be able to ignore

614
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This life is bitter

615
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Can't be read

616
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Love is like a bone

617
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Use my life to stab the pearl

618
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ask what love is

619
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Escape from the world

620
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Not afraid of being left alone

621
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In the sky

622
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
As long as you can be happy

623
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You are not hurt

624
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Why are you so strong

625
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I can't breathe

626
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't know what's wrong with me

627
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
After listening to you

628
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think I'm fine

629
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Since you are all right

630
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Then you will go to the farm with me tomorrow

631
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I haven't seen you for a long time

632
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm not afraid of you

633
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't know how the people are there

634
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
it is good

635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Where do you want to go in the future

636
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I am with you

637
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Look at your feet

638
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I just didn't expect

639
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now this little rabbit

640
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Will be married

641
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Laoyan

642
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Can you really forget Shuyu?

643
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I can't

644
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I can't

645
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I can't

646
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I can't

647
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Can you really forget Shuyu?

648
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Marrying this matter is a big deal

649
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
If you don't like Hao Du

650
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
No one can force you

651
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Changge

652
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I am no longer the little rabbit who loves to cry

653
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Actually all the time

654
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I treat Brother Shuyu as a hero

655
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Rely on him

656
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Admire him

657
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Gradually become a habit

658
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Until the thing about the tears

659
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I realized

660
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I have been ignoring

661
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Hao Du by my side

662
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Brother Shuyu

663
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Let him always be a brother

664
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Are you sure you really like Hao Du?

665
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Then

666
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What about you to that Sun?

667
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
What do you feel about him?

668
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Why are you getting worse?

669
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I asked you

670
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You are in front of this Sun

671
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Is it the easiest feeling?

672
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
All the happiness and sorrow

673
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Can be shown to him

674
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And

675
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Not afraid

676
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
He will dislike your shortcomings

677
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Want to show him the real self

678
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
When I met him

679
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It was the most embarrassing

680
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And the worst time

681
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That's right

682
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I am in front of Hao Du

683
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I also feel the most relaxed and natural

684
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
On the contrary, I am so clumsy in Brother Shuyu

685
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
In fact, I should have let myself go

686
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And let him let go of his guilt

687
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Everyone should enjoy the most relaxed state

688
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It is my own heart that can live a happy life

689
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
By the way

690
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I want to sleep early today

691
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Tomorrow I have to go to the farm with Hao Du

692
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So fast

693
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
No

694
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
This is called

695
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Newly designed

696
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's so late

697
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Why is it so crowded outside?

698
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He Meng Shu

699
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Yes

700
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Can't sign

701
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yes, it can't be signed

702
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Tie Le Bu Le

703
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Why are you so afraid of Ashile Bu?

704
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The reason why we are in the north and south

705
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The reason why we are in the north and south

706
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is to save your courage

707
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Today we just won the game

708
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Tang Huang is going to let us sign He Meng Shu

709
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Isn't this obvious

710
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Let us choose the border in front of Ashile Bu?

711
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
In this way

712
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Can't Tang be another Ashile Bu?

713
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
This person is trying to get rid of the fake

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Stop talking

715
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Don't pull us

716
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Changge

717
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Everyone

718
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Tang Huang means

719
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
With Tang

720
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
We don't need to be afraid of Ashile Bu

721
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Of course

722
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
He Meng was proposed by Mobei

723
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
If Tang becomes the second Ashile Bu

724
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Then Mobei will not accept it

725
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes, He Meng was proposed by Mobei

726
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Our Tie Le Bu won't accept it

727
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And I tell you

728
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This He Meng Shu

729
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
There is no way that our Tie Le Bu will sign

730
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Everyone

731
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You all think about it

732
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Once it's signed on He Meng Shu

733
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That is to be an enemy of Ashile Bu

734
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Ashile Bu can't be offended

735
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yes, they are real

736
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What if it's an enemy?

737
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Our Tang will protect allies of each tribe

738
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Even if Ashile Bu wants to cut someone

739
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Have to think about it again, right?

740
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes, this is

741
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Ashile Bu is too powerful

742
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Mobei Princess wants to help Tang

743
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I can't stop

744
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But don't make it difficult for our Tie Le Bu

745
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Go

746
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Go

747
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This

748
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This is really useless

749
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is really useless

750
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
This is really useless

751
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This is really useless

752
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This is really useless

753
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
This is really useless

754
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This is really useless

755
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
This is really useless

756
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
This is really useless

757
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
This is really useless

758
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
This is really useless

759
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This is really useless

760
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
This is really useless

761
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
This is really useless

762
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
This is really useless

763
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This is really useless

764
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
This is really useless

765
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
This is really useless

766
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This is really useless

767
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This is really useless

768
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This is really useless

769
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is really useless

770
