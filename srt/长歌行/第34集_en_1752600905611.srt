1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
I'll be the one who breaks through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I'll be the one who shines in the dark night

3
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,320
I'll be the one who sings for him

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,320
He is the river of life and the light of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 15

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It says in the story that the court will divide the farmland for the refugees

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and give them a house to live in, so they won't have to work hard, and have a lot of water

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's all

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The water can be good for the porridge, but it can also be good for the crops

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you think he will be a good emperor?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If he dares to slack off, I won't kill him

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's good to let him go

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Maybe

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Although it's a little bit unfair, I know that he is the best choice for Tang

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What's your plan for the future?

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now they all know that I'm still here

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Staying in Luoyang is not the best way

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The border of Tang is a flat border

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to the desert to see the other side

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then come with me

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've been here for a while

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know what's going on

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shi said I should go back

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mr. Qin said that we can leave Luoyang today

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So soon?

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,440
The

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So soon?

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We'll leave for a while

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Here's something for you

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We have to wear this

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
There's a defamation

33
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,180
Su An.

34
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,060
Master, it's me.

35
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,380
My old deity.

36
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,100
Luoyang is so small.

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,580
I didn't expect to meet you here.

38
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,660
It seems that we are destined to meet each other.

39
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,300
Where are you going?

40
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,140
Why don't you stay in Luoyang for a few more days?

41
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,700
No, no, no.

42
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,580
I heard that the palace is going to summon me.

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,300
If I can't get into the Imperial Medical Bureau,

44
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,620
it will be troublesome.

45
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,340
No, no, no.

46
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,140
I have to run.

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,660
bull flies

48
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,140
A dirty place

49
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,020
is already life

50
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,700
There's an advantage and anuther

51
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,740
I finally understand the old man

52
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,260
Said,

53
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,420
trouble is great

54
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,620
As Ye's daughter,

55
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,860
I have to grow up quickly.

56
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,460
Sister,

57
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,820
just go.

58
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,580
I won't come

59
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
even if you beat me to death.

60
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,540
Changge,

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,900
I wish you all the best.

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,300
‏Third Brother,

63
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,900
‏back.

64
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
I'll see you off.

65
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,020
General Li.

66
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,700
Call me Brother Li.

67
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,660
Brother Qing,

68
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,580
you're so mean.

69
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,580
You left

70
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,300
without saying goodbye.

71
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,180
So the one you're looking for

72
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,340
is the Princess.

73
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,940
You have a good taste.

74
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,260
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,020
You're so mysterious.

76
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,660
Nothing.

77
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,660
How are you, Your Grace?

78
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,420
I'm fine.

79
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,420
How are you, Your Grace?

80
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,620
I didn't expect you to be

81
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,020
so free and free.

82
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,580
My free time is coming to an end.

83
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,140
In a few days,

84
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
I'll leave with Minister Du

85
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,820
and go to Chang'an together.

86
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,660
You're a talented man.

87
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
It's a pity

88
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,140
to stay in this country.

89
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,540
I'm a little jealous of you.

90
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
Beijing is vast and the water is fresh.

91
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,500
Niuyang is a big city.

92
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,860
If I have a chance,

93
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,140
I'd like to see it.

94
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,060
Brother Li,

95
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,020
how did you know?

96
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,900
Don't be nervous.

97
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,380
I came here alone.

98
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,180
I came here

99
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,860
to tell you something.

100
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,740
Please.

101
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,500
In fact, there is no so-called

102
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,820
unarmed military tactics in the world.

103
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,340
I was the one who was suspicious of that book.

104
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,220
I just wanted to see

105
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,580
if you would

106
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,900
get your own military tactics

107
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,140
and get your own spirit.

108
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,860
However,

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,540
there is no such thing as military tactics

110
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,460
but there is a military family.

111
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,220
The military family is not only a general

112
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,700
but also a knight.

113
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,900
However, the real military family

114
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,020
is not based on martial arts skills

115
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,620
but on the mind.

116
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,540
The heart of the person is invincible.

117
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,900
Think about it.

118
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Don't rush.

119
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,700
Some people may not be able to

120
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,300
understand the life of a poor person.

121
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,340
But I believe

122
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,820
you can do it.

123
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,460
If I meet you on the battlefield in the future,

124
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,620
I will not forget this saying.

125
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,100
The heart of the person is invincible.

126
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,180
It's a good lesson.

127
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,540
All right, I should go back.

128
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,420
Otherwise, the mother tiger in the family

129
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,620
will not spare anyone.

130
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,260
I said goodbye now.

131
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,540
Take care.

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,220
You'll spend your whole life

133
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,740
merely overstating.

134
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,460
I am sure you are good at

135
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,220
applying the spirit in your magic.

136
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,940
Hurry up.

137
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,460
Hurry up.

138
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,220
How many days has it been?

139
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,580
It's already the thirteenth day.

140
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,780
Da Wu, what's going on?

141
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,820
I've tried all the methods I can.

142
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,260
Still, it doesn't work.

143
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,140
There are more and more people

144
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,060
who are sick in the camp these days.

145
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,300
That's not right.

146
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,180
The water and food in our camp

147
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,540
are clean and well.

148
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,220
How can it be...

149
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,540
I can't get through today.

150
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,380
I'm afraid...

151
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm afraid it's the curse

152
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,900
that God has given to Eagle Division.

153
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,980
Curse?

154
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,100
No.

155
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,980
I have to notify Sun as soon as possible.

156
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,860
Go.

157
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,060
This disease really spreads.

158
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,500
Did I hurt them?

159
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,380
No.

160
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,020
We can't go on like this.

161
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,820
No.

162
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,580
We can't stay here anymore.

163
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,780
You must leave.

164
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,700
No.

165
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,740
Sister.

166
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,260
Where are we going?

167
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,860
Master said

168
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,100
if you don't listen,

169
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,620
you should know the consequences.

170
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,100
Bu Zhen.

171
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,260
Where are we going?

172
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,140
Bu Zhen.

173
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,500
Bu Zhen.

174
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,140
Help me.

175
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,940
Help me.

176
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,580
Help me.

177
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,900
Your Majesty.

178
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,220
Du Qing.

179
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,180
You're back.

180
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,980
Your Majesty.

181
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,900
I met Li Changge in Luoyang.

182
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,500
I met Li Changge in Luoyang.

183
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,580
I met Li Changge in Luoyang.

184
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,740
You met Changge?

185
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,580
God has promised

186
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,540
Changge would be safe.

187
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,780
Li Changge was killed in Liuyun Temple

188
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,460
after she followed Yu Nie and Chi Ni

189
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,740
and escaped with Ashile Tribe's men.

190
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,060
I failed to capture her

191
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,260
and I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

192
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,100
You mean she was with Ashile Tribe's men?

193
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,860
Before she escaped,

194
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,340
she saved my life in Liuyun Temple

195
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,420
and the people in the temple.

196
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,820
Du Qing, please get up.

197
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,580
Yes.

198
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,340
But she was so weak

199
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,740
and stubborn.

200
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
No matter where she was,

201
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,380
no matter who she was friends with,

202
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,180
she would never

203
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,180
move a single inch.

204
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,540
Luckily, Changge is still alive.

205
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,500
Otherwise,

206
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,220
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.

207
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,260
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

208
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,420
Li Changge is not only alive

209
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,220
but also capable of killing people with swords and swords.

210
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,540
Du Qing, you're always so strict.

211
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
How come she escaped

212
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,540
under your nose this time?

213
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,100
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,420
I just blame Li Changge

215
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,060
for being so cunning.

216
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm so bored.

217
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,020
I need to take a hot bath

218
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,180
and have a meal.

219
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,940
Let's go.

220
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,700
Yes.

221
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,380
Sorry.

222
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,140
Your Highness, the meal's ready.

223
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,620
Your Highness.

224
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,140
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Here, give it to me.

226
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,740
Get out.

227
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,980
I don't want to eat it.

228
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Brother Shuyu,

229
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,460
why are you here?

230
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,900
I heard Hao Du's voice just now.

231
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,340
Are you angry with Hao Du?

232
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,300
He deceived me and used me.

233
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,700
He's unforgivable.

234
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,820
You can't just leave without eating.

235
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,140
Here.

236
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,740
I'm a little hungry.

237
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Let's eat together.

238
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,820
These are all from Hao Du.

239
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,900
Then you can keep them.

240
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,940
I don't want to be angry with him.

241
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,420
Do you think

242
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,140
Hao Du has changed a little bit?

243
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,820
I admit that

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,260
Hao Du,

245
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,780
is really one of a kind

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
compared to the old Hao Du.

247
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
But he lied to me

248
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,900
and almost set Changge up.

249
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,460
He costs me trouble.

250
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,860
If Hao Du is the one who saved Changge

251
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,380
What does that mean?

252
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,220
I'll tell you something.

253
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,220
That day in Liuying Harbour,

254
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,060
he ruinedред

255
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,780
my life.

256
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,660
I want to tell you

257
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,180
that day, when we fought against Chini at Liuying Temple,

258
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,860
Changge was there.

259
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,140
You knew that.

260
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,580
Do you know how he escaped?

261
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,140
Changge is so smart.

262
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,140
There are many ways to escape.

263
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,540
Actually, he is smart.

264
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,580
Liuying Temple was surrounded by the soldiers.

265
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,260
How did he escape without any reason?

266
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,420
You mean

267
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,580
Hao Du let Changge go on purpose?

268
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,620
I've sent someone to inquire about it.

269
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,900
When a soldier

270
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,420
was cleaning the corpse,

271
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,260
he found a corpse moving.

272
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,900
I didn't expect Hao Du to scold him

273
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,100
and say he was blind.

274
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,020
Now I think

275
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,460
the corpse could be Changge.

276
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,020
But didn't Hao Du keep catching Changge?

277
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,740
Who knows?

278
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,860
Maybe Changge changed him.

279
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,100
Or maybe

280
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,740
your slap woke him up.

281
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,460
Brother Shuyu,

282
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,340
why did you tell me this?

283
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,500
Did you change your mind about Hao Du?

284
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,700
Change my mind?

285
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,460
I still hate him.

286
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,340
But the truth is the truth.

287
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,540
You have the right to know.

288
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,940
I'm telling you this

289
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,300
because I hope you won't refuse

290
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,340
the protection of Hao Du.

291
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,700
After all,

292
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,180
he is a good personal guard.

293
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,180
Thank you, Brother Shuyu.

294
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,460
Let's eat.

295
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,460
It's getting cold.

296
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,060
The grassland is ahead.

297
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,300
Young Master,

298
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,060
no matter where you are,

299
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
I'll be by your side.

300
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,180
Master,

301
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,580
you've been in Shuozhou for so many years.

302
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,580
The person you hate the most

303
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,060
should be Ashile Tribe.

304
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,580
Master,

305
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,580
how about...

306
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,260
In my life,

307
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,500
I only want to follow the Lord.

308
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,060
Nothing else matters.

309
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,140
Master Qin,

310
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,100
I'll make sure

311
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,180
you won't get hurt

312
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,500
after going to Eagle Division.

313
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,140
Ah Zhun,

314
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,940
you underestimated me.

315
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm old now.

316
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,180
What do you think I'm afraid of?

317
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
I didn't mean that.

318
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,060
It's getting late.

319
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,220
Have an early rest.

320
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,780
We have to leave tomorrow.

321
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,860
Young Master,

322
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,940
you should sleep too.

323
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,380
I'll have Xu Feng

324
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
watch over you.

325
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,140
Xu Feng must have gone to sleep with Yuanniang.

326
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,260
Don't wake him up.

327
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,140
Master Qin,

328
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,420
go back and have an early rest.

329
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,140
Okay.

330
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,100
Tai Qin,

331
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,100
I didn't expect you to find the little military counselor.

332
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,580
Ya Luo, why are you here?

333
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,020
Mu Jin asked me to find you in the hall.

334
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,500
I didn't expect to meet you here.

335
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,220
Tai Qin, go back.

336
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,420
Something happened to our Eagle Division.

337
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,460
What happened?

338
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,700
Da Wu said

339
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,180
our Eagle Division was cursed by the evil demon.

340
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,580
Cursed by the evil demon?

341
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,540
Well...

342
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,060
I'm not sure about that.

343
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,300
Anyway, many people in Eagle Division

344
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,220
are ill.

345
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,060
They have the shards of the rattan.

346
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,700
Many people died.

347
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,420
Da Wu didn't die at all.

348
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,860
You should go back and have a look.

349
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,180
The shards of the rattan are infected.

350
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:06,980
Yes.

351
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,780
But Master Sun just left.

352
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,700
Master Qin,

353
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,980
can I ask you for a favor?

354
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,140
Yes, Master.

355
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,940
Can we ask our brothers

356
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,260
to find Master Sun back?

357
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,420
Because they're sitting in the donkey carriage now.

358
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,380
They shouldn't go too far.

359
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,260
Don't worry.

360
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,260
I'll send someone

361
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,740
to catch Master Sun back.

362
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,020
Thank you, Master Qin.

363
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,380
Ya Luo,

364
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,460
you go and have an early rest.

365
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,420
We'll leave for Eagle Division tomorrow morning.

366
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,340
Yes.

367
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,900
Changge.

368
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,900
Sun,

369
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,140
don't try to drive me away.

370
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
We've been through

371
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,780
many horrible things together.

372
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,860
We agreed to have a hard time together.

373
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,460
We'll have a hard time this time, too.

374
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,540
Okay.

375
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,900
Let's go together.

376
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,380
Look at your face!

377
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,980
Look at your face, too!

378
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,660
Buzha.

379
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
Little brother.

380
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,580
You're up.

381
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,580
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,180
It's fine.

383
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,420
Sister, I'm going to die.

384
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,220
Don't talk nonsense.

385
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,820
You're still young.

386
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,860
You'll live a long life.

387
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,460
That's great.

388
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,860
That's a good boy.

389
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,100
You have a sister.

390
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,540
You'll be fine.

391
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,900
They sent me a message.

392
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,140
But I accidentally got a cold on the way.

393
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
You'll be fine.

394
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,140
They said that only if you see my face,

395
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:12,140
you'll definitely come back to me.

396
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
It's okay.

397
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,140
It's okay.

398
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
You're fine.

399
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
It's okay.

400
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
It's okay.

401
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
It's okay.

402
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
It's okay.

403
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,100
You have a sister.

404
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,860
It's okay.

405
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,860
I'm with you.

406
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,860
There are no slaves in the world.

407
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,860
I'll go out and get you a basin of water.

408
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,860
I'm not going to die by myself.

409
00:22:49,860 --> 00:23:01,440
I'll be a손

410
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
in the heavens.

411
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,340
I'll fetch you a cup of water

412
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,000
and get you away thoroughly.

413
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,700
I brought some spices for you.

414
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,700
I asked you to burn them in the stove.

415
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,980
Are you there?

416
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,100
I'm going in.

417
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,660
This kid is a curse.

418
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,820
And he

419
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,900
is the one who brought the curse.

420
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,340
He is the one.

421
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,860
Wenjing.

422
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,140
Good for you, Mimi Gu Yi.

423
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,460
We should have taken you in.

424
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,340
How dare you curse us?

425
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,620
You are the one who ruined my child.

426
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,740
He is dying.

427
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,580
Give my child back.

428
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,020
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,780
Let her go.

430
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,940
What's the use of saying sorry?

431
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,860
Give my child back.

432
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,380
Let her go.

433
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,500
Ask her about it first.

434
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,180
Mimi.

435
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,860
Where did you get this kid?

436
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,420
It has nothing to do with you, right?

437
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,580
I saved this kid.

438
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,660
I hid it in the tent.

439
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,340
I...

440
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,260
I didn't expect him to...

441
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,100
He was cursed

442
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,460
and cursed us.

443
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,940
Otherwise,

444
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,540
why did he curse us

445
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,660
and make us stay together?

446
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,260
But he didn't do anything.

447
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,060
He did.

448
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,540
Wuji.

449
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
Did you hear what Da Wu said?

450
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,820
He is the one who caused our Eagle Division's death.

451
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,980
He is cursed.

452
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,740
He can't stay.

453
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,260
Kill him.

454
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,900
Kill him.

455
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,300
Yes.

456
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,780
Kill him.

457
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,580
You can't leave.

458
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,860
Wuji.

459
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,500
Mimi Gu Yi.

460
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,780
You can't stay.

461
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
Kill him.

462
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,020
Kill him.

463
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,700
Kill him.

464
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,180
Kill him.

465
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,380
Kill him.

466
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,060
Kill him.

467
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,420
You want to protect him?

468
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,780
Wuji.

469
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,900
You were bewitched by this demoness, right?

470
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,260
Mimi Gu Yi is also from Eagle Division.

471
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,220
I can't watch you burn her to death.

472
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,500
Kill him.

473
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,700
Kill him.

474
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,020
Kill him.

475
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,180
Kill him.

476
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,940
Kill him.

477
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,620
Did you hear that?

478
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,460
Move.

479
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,180
Move.

480
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,660
Do you want the whole Eagle Division

481
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,860
to die with him?

482
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,300
If you want to burn him to death,

483
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,700
burn me first.

484
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,020
Kill him.

485
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,540
Wuji.

486
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,100
Kill him.

487
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,900
Wuji.

488
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,220
Kill him.

489
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,540
Kill him.

490
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,500
Move.

491
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,660
Move.

492
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,340
teamwork

493
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,860
Stop it!

494
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,100
Te Chi!

495
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,740
Sun!

496
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,900
Te Chi.

497
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,460
You came at the right time.

498
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Mimi Gu Yi

499
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,140
has cursed Eagle Division.

500
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,340
Eagle Division

501
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,140
has let a lot of people down.

502
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
They will die soon.

503
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:40,860
Tegin,

504
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,300
you must help us to uphold justice.

505
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,660
Yes.

506
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,060
Yes.

507
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,660
Yes.

508
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,180
Yes.

509
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,980
Yes.

510
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,660
Yes.

511
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,420
Eagle Division will never kill each other.

512
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,780
Nothing

513
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,940
is the reason for our killing.

514
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,740
He makes sense.

515
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,900
But, Tegin...

516
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Leave this to me.

517
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,020
I'll explain it to you.

518
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,620
Everyone,

519
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,060
go back.

520
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,980
Let's go.

521
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,500
Let's go.

522
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,180
Let's go.

523
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,940
Let's go.

524
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,460
Let's go.

525
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,140
Let's go.

526
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,900
Let's go.

527
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,740
Let's go.

528
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,100
Untie her.

529
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,140
Mimi.

530
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,460
Mimi.

531
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:28,980
Chengzhi.

532
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,180
You're finally back.

533
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,700
You're finally back.

534
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,580
Are you scared?

535
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,140
It's okay. It's okay.

536
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,980
Don't be afraid.

537
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,020
I'm back.

538
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,060
It's okay.

539
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,260
Don't cry.

540
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,420
I just went to see

541
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,620
those who were cursed.

542
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,580
How is it?

543
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,940
It shouldn't be a curse.

544
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,060
It's plague.

545
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,500
Plague?

546
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,380
Come with me.

547
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,020
Let's go.

548
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,740
I'll take you.

549
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,380
Mimi,

550
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,900
where did you find him?

551
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,740
In the middle of the morning,

552
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,100
being in the bedward era,

553
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,740
I always

554
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,660
slept here alone.

555
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,460
Despite the world,

556
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,540
it still

557
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,140
I would go to the sheep-sale

558
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,860
every morning.

559
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,780
He passed out beside the sheep-sale.

560
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,380
I...

561
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,660
Do you know which tribe he belongs to?

562
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,500
Since he's infected with the disease,

563
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,780
he can't go too far.

564
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,060
I guess he came from nearby.

565
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,500
Don't be afraid.

566
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,300
I know you want to save him.

567
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,260
But I think it's a bit strange.

568
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,940
Did he tell you anything before he died?

569
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,540
No.

570
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,340
He...

571
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,220
I...

572
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,620
Bu Zhen?

573
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,140
He's called Bu Zhen?

574
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,980
No.

575
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,380
I don't know what he's called.

576
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,820
I just called him whatever I wanted.

577
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,980
But if I don't get him back,

578
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,500
he'll die.

579
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,380
I know. I know.

580
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,500
Don't be afraid.

581
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,260
We're here anyway.

582
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,020
Stay here and be good.

583
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
I'll go find Sun.

584
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,020
I'll be back soon.

585
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,460
I...

586
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,980
I'll go.

587
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,420
On the plain,

588
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,180
the plague is incurable.

589
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,020
What's the difference between

590
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,380
the ward and the curse?

591
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,820
But everyone still has a glimmer of hope.

592
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,620
The plague won't be without a cause.

593
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,740
Most likely, it's related to the child

594
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,020
that Mimi brought back.

595
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,980
Did you ask her out?

596
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,660
She called her Bu Zhen.

597
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260
I feel like I've heard this name somewhere.

598
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,340
Bu Zhen?

599
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,940
Does she know Mimi?

600
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,260
It should be something else.

601
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,780
I'll ask her.

602
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,100
Wait.

603
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,980
Whatever you force Mimi to do,

604
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,180
she won't tell you

605
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,020
whatever she doesn't want to say.

606
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,180
Fine.

607
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,500
I won't ask her.

608
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
I'll go with her later.

609
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
Let's not talk about Mimi first.

610
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,660
Sun,

611
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,580
what are you going to do about the plague?

612
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:49,900
Tonight,

613
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,100
we'll build a new camp outside the camp

614
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,820
and move the patients to the old one.

615
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,900
We must do it as soon as possible.

616
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,100
Mu Jin,

617
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,580
arrange the people and the carriage

618
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,420
to help them move the supplies.

619
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,180
The relatives can apply to go with them.

620
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,220
It's free of charge.

621
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,140
We must cure them.

622
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,980
Yes.

623
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,180
Is this your custom?

624
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,580
Changge,

625
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,740
do you know

626
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
what we'll do if we encounter

627
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,220
a storm on our way to Qianxi?

628
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,260
We'll work together to protect the women.

629
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,460
No.

630
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,740
Those who are old and weak

631
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,340
will take the initiative to stand outside.

632
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,420
We'll protect the women and the strong warriors

633
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,500
to protect the storm.

634
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,740
They'll die if we do that.

635
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,060
But I don't want to die like this.

636
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,860
There's a custom in our Central Plains

637
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,900
that we should follow the rules.

638
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,860
But if we don't do our best,

639
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,260
we can't follow the rules.

640
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,460
Maybe...

641
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,740
Maybe we have another way.

642
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,940
What way?

643
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,300
Mimi has taken care of this young man for so long.

644
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,140
It's been so long.

645
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,100
If he's the source of the plague,

646
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,140
why didn't Mimi get infected?

647
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,060
You witch!

648
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,580
Give my son back to me!

649
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,620
Wait.

650
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,780
I'll kill you.

651
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
I'll kill you.

652
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,540
Then he can save everyone.

653
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,060
He can save my son.

654
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,340
Don't run!

655
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,860
How could you be so stupid?

656
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,180
Why?

657
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,340
Why are you defending me?

658
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,180
Why?

659
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,860
As long as you're fine.

660
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm sorry.

661
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:39,620
They're red remnant

662
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,780
rimed with poison.

663
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,780
What?

664
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,060
We can't wait any longer.

665
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,820
I'll go with Mu Jin to the outside.

666
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,900
No.

667
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,460
We have no other choice.

668
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,700
Mu Jin can't leave us alone.

669
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,140
Mu Jin is going to leave us alone.

670
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,300
But what if you fall down too?

671
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,500
What about Eagle Division?

672
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Send her to me.

673
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,620
I'll take care of her.

674
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,780
No.

675
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,020
I'll take care of her.

676
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,660
Everything here

677
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,900
is my fault.

678
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,540
It's also because of me.

679
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,220
Mu Jin

680
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,660
will become like this.

681
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,660
No, Mimi.

682
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,100
If you go out now, you'll die.

683
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,700
Even if I die,

684
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,940
it's my fault.

685
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,620
Don't worry.

686
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,580
I'll take good care of her.

687
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,100
Master.

688
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,340
I didn't expect that

689
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,820
Master Qin would come to you so soon.

690
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,380
You're smart.

691
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,140
You asked Master Qin to come to me.

692
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
You're so cursed.

693
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
You're all nonsense.

694
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,540
I've seen a lot of such situations.

695
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,140
It must be a strange disease.

696
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,620
Without me,

697
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,500
how can you two

698
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,820
handle it?

699
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,500
Yes.

700
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,740
Thank you, Master.

701
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,660
But you must be careful.

702
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,260
Many people have fallen ill.

703
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
I'll take care of them.

704
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,540
Yes.

705
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,620
Many people have fallen ill.

706
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,780
If not,

707
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,580
why should I come here?

708
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,780
Master, I'll lead the way.

709
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,660
Please follow me.

710
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,180
Please, Immortal.

711
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,860
Lead the way.

712
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,860
Master Qin.

713
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,620
How are 18th Prince and Xu Feng?

714
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,140
Yuanniang is too young.

715
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
I'm afraid she'll get sick.

716
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,740
I'll ask Xu Feng and 18th Prince

717
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,900
to wait for Yuanniang

718
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,140
outside the tent in Eagle Division.

719
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,940
That's good.

720
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,780
Master Qin, don't go in yet.

721
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,780
Wait for our news.

722
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,460
Okay.

723
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,180
Okay.

724
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,380
Greetings, Master.

725
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,340
Master.

726
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
Yan.

727
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
It's good that you're back.

728
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,620
It's good that you're back.

729
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,180
Greetings, Yan.

730
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,380
Yan.

731
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,860
You...

732
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,260
You've lost weight.

733
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,020
I'm unfilial.

734
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,300
I'm unfilial.

735
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,580
I made you worried.

736
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,100
Yan, I've lost a lot of weight too.

737
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,900
I almost can't come back.

738
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,140
I'm in Luoyang.

739
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,980
Yan.

740
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,940
I've suffered enough in Luoyang.

741
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,900
I heard that

742
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,260
you had a lot of fun

743
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,820
in Luoyang.

744
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,260
Even Minister Du

745
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,820
can't get over it.

746
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,980
Yan was pissed off

747
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,020
for getting harmful behavior.

748
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,740
young master despises him.

749
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:26,740
Jahr, she already paidve

750
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,860
Prince,

751
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,340
I've done many bitter things

752
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,540
and hanged you

753
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,060
with such a 1990 hand.

754
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,700
Thank you,出來

755
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,360
Le Yan, you offended the Crown Prince

756
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,280
Please punish me

757
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:48,700
Lian

758
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,140
I saw your downfall

759
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,020
Seems similar to Changge

760
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,920
Le Yan

761
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,300
Although I am not Changge

762
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
I've grown up a lot

763
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,140
after I buried my son.

764
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,100
Please forgive me, Father.

765
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,380
I know my mistake.

766
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,100
Father,

767
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,780
please forgive me

768
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,420
for my sister's sake.

769
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,460
Get back to your Eastern Palace

770
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
and reflect on your mistakes.

771
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,780
Okay.

772
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,180
I won't bother you

773
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,540
to talk to me.

774
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,940
Okay.

775
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,060
Yan,

776
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,740
you've been

777
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,140
suffering all the way.

778
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,220
Father,

779
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,900
I don't think I'm suffering.

780
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,180
And I also think

781
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,940
I've been poisoned

782
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,580
and I won't die.

783
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,060
Yan,

784
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,740
you're really different from before.

785
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,340
Are you hungry?

786
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,980
Let's have dinner with me.

787
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,860
We can talk while eating.

788
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,420
I'll listen to you.

789
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,860
Father,

790
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,980
how is he?

791
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,460
What curse?

792
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,140
Nonsense.

793
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,260
It's just a cold.

794
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,980
Is there any cure for this cold?

795
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,300
There's only a useless medicine

796
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,300
and no cure for it.

797
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,620
Then,

798
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,340
you've got a solution.

799
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,780
It's a terrible disease,

800
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,380
but it can be cured.

801
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,140
Give me the pen.

802
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,340
These medicines

803
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,940
are actually very common.

804
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,060
There are some in Eagle Division.

805
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,540
But one of them

806
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,060
is still missing.

807
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,020
What's that?

808
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,460
The purple grass in the desert.

809
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,460
Can we use

810
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,340
other medicines to replace the purple grass?

811
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,820
No.

812
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,420
The medicine can be replaced.

813
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,420
But it must be

814
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,860
the medicine's cause.

815
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,660
You may not know

816
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,740
that the disease

817
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,740
originated from the desert.

818
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,380
But it didn't spread to the grassland.

819
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,620
It's because

820
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,100
the locals often

821
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,420
eat and wear purple grass.

822
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,140
I see.

823
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,140
No wonder I wasn't infected.

824
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,780
When I was young,

825
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,140
my father used purple grass

826
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,220
to cure me.

827
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,700
As far as I know,

828
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,060
the disease won't be cured

829
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,020
after being infected once.

830
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,340
So this young lady

831
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,980
is not lucky

832
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,460
because you

833
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,180
produced the power of hell.

834
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,780
We can find the purple grass in the desert.

835
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,180
But what can we do

836
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,860
to control their disease?

837
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,180
Don't worry.

838
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,060
I'll give them some medicines

839
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,380
to take.

840
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,820
It can temporarily relieve the disease

841
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,420
and save their lives.

842
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,980
But

843
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,140
they must take the purple grass

844
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,780
within ten days.

845
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,180
Otherwise,

846
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,020
it's hard to cure the immortals.

847
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,140
Purple grass is in the desert.

848
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,100
I thought Ashile Tribe would have it.

849
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,940
There must be a tooth.

850
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,260
I'll go get the medicine.

851
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,300
Wait.

852
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,740
The Eagle Division is in a bad mood.

853
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,260
If you go now,

854
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,140
I'm afraid they'll come up with a way

855
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,460
to make things difficult for Mimi.

856
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,620
I'm afraid she'll be in trouble again.

857
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,060
Tegin.

858
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,420
I'll go.

859
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,620
I'll run fast.

860
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,460
Besides,

861
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,900
I'm just a nobody.

862
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,700
Great Khan won't make things difficult for me.

863
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,700
Don't worry, Tegin.

864
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,780
I promise

865
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,780
I'll bring the medicine back safely.

866
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,380
Okay.

867
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,900
I've written down

868
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,420
Ding Xiang's actions in the Central Plains.

869
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,420
Give this to Great Khan.

870
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,060
He'll understand when he sees it.

871
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,780
Yes.

872
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,940
Go.

873
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,260
Thanks.

874
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,780
I will never forget you.

875
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,780
I will never forget you.

876
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
I will never forget you.

877
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
I will never forget you.

878
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,780
I will never forget you.

879
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
I will never forget you.

880
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
I will never forget you.

881
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,780
There is always a longing

882
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
between you and me

883
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,780
that has been in front of everything.

884
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
In our world,

885
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
in different worlds,

886
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,780
I am always missing you.

887
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
As the years go by,

888
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
the night becomes a dark night.

889
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,780
The cocoon in the sky.

890
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,780
There is always a moment

891
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,780
that burns the flame in my heart.

892
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,780
There is always a longing

893
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
between you and me

894
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,780
that has been in front of everything.

895
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
In our world,

896
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
in different worlds,

897
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,780
I am always missing you.

898
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
As the years go by,

899
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,780
the night becomes a dark night.

900
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,780
The cocoon in the sky.

901
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,780
The cocoon in the sky.

902
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,780
The cocoon in the sky.

903
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
The cocoon in the sky.
