00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I didn't expect you to smash the crown for me.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why are you here?

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You asked Tang Hong to lock us up.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm here to take you out.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can leave soon.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Me?

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What about you?

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You...

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What's the price for you to go back?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sher.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before I go back,

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've decided to tell you something.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't kill your wolf.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't forgive my father for this.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He didn't want to see us together.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Only by our mutual support

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
can we gain his throne.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So he sent someone to kill your wolf

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and gave me the wolf skin as a sword case.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why are you saying it now?

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can say it now.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you afraid that you won't get a chance after you go out?

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or are you afraid that I can't accept the truth?

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can you accept it?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Even if you can accept it,

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
do you dare to resist?

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sher.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
For the grasslands,

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
there must be someone to stand out and do it.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That person is me.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sun.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What are you going to do?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is the wood seal of Eagle Division.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You all know it, right?

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You've been lurking in Dingxiang for days.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're plotting rebellion.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now Ashile Tribe has moved Dingxiang.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I hope you can be honest

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and focus on Dingxiang.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Whoever has a second thought

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
will end up like this.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What is this?

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is this?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What is this?

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What is this?

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is this?

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What is this?

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't worry.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Your master is not here.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I won't kill you.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll do whatever you say.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mother.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I thought

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you wouldn't come to Wen'an.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I will always be your son.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you don't share my feelings,

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
we are just

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
a match made in heaven.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mother.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I often remember the days

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when I was in prison.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I slept in your arms every day.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was with you.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You didn't have to fight or fight.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You didn't have to worry or fear.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was the most memorable time.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But the time you felt the most memorable

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
was the most fragile.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
As long as you say something,

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it will be easily broken.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What I'm doing now

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is for the sake of the future.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No one will tear us apart again.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Only when we are strong

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
can we be at peace.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Understand?

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Go home with me.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Your Majesty.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The princess of Tang

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
is the princess of Mobei.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wonder if

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
it's your arrangement.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I hope

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
it's my arrangement.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a pity

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
that my princess

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
would rather be the princess of Mobei

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
than go back to Chang'an.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Emissaries,

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the grudge between Tang and me

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is my personal matter.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't need to tell you

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
all the reasons.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But since I can represent Mobei,

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't need to say anything

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
even if it's the benefit of Mobei.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can prove

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that Mobei and my Atatars have reached a consensus

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and will ally with Tang.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Besides,

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't need to tell you

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
how to deal with the princess.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is the identity of the princess

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the key to the alliance with Tang?

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's indeed

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the family business of Tang.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It has nothing to do with us.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just want to ask you, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are going to release the Khan

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and trade with Ashile Tribe.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Why do you pretend to be in alliance with the desert?

119
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,000
пер戰

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Each of them was taken people away

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
by Ashile tribe?

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
When the alliance is founded,

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Tang acting like

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,040
to ask for the benefits for the various departments of the desert.

125
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,120
Everyone,

126
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,320
this is the welfare list

127
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,720
written by Ashile Tribe.

128
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,960
There is nothing missing.

129
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Did Your Majesty release

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Xiao Kehan because of this?

131
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,960
Xiao Kehan intended to assassinate the east palace

132
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,960
and sent someone to assassinate the crown prince.

133
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,000
He was a personal servant.

134
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,560
For this reason,

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
why would I

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
release a criminal

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,120
who committed such a serious crime?

138
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,960
The treaty is always valid.

139
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,640
If you don't want to be involved with Tang,

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,520
I will not force you.

141
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,120
If you don't want to be part of the alliance,

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,280
you don't need to worry.

143
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,640
I will still send your people

144
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,280
home safely.

145
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,520
If we don't sign,

146
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,720
will we not be able to leave?

147
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,520
Yes.

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,720
We can leave if we want to.

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,360
But we can't leave

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
if we want to.

151
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,680
Tang will not only stop us,

152
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,440
but also send troops to escort us.

153
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,040
The journey is long.

154
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,840
When you return to your hometown,

155
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm sure when you are at home,

156
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,760
Tang will send your people

157
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
home safely.

158
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
They are all sent home?

159
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,440
Tang has made a promise today.

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Whether it is signed or not,

161
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,160
there will be no worries in each department.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
If Tang's allies

163
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,320
ask for help in the future,

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,280
Tang will support them to the end.

165
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,280
I just got back my life.

166
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,800
It's true that

167
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,040
I owe Tang a favor.

168
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
What else can I not believe?

169
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,480
I, Tie Le Bu,

170
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,400
am willing to ally with Tang.

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,040
Here.

172
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,560
Let's sign the seal.

173
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
If you are afraid of Tang,

174
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,720
you can take the red mud on the side.

175
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,420
Hold this.

176
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,640
It's just a lucky sample.

177
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,040
Just a little change .

178
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
You are very kind and kind.

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,520
ける,

180
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,520
be kind to give me a gift,

181
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,220
okay?

182
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,520
Thank you so much.

183
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,400
See you next time.

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,460
I'm sorry to bother you.

185
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,780
Just don't look at me like this.

186
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,260
You're gone.

187
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,820
What's wrong?

188
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,280
These are all yours.

189
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,520
You're insane.

190
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,360
I actually have something that I want to tell you.

191
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,640
The Tang Dynasty and the other tribes

193
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,600
have been united by bloodshed.

194
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,440
In the future,

195
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,600
whether it's a disaster or a war,

196
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
the Tang Dynasty and the other tribes

197
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,000
will advance and retreat together.

198
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,760
There will be no regret.

199
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
The Tang Dynasty and the other tribes

200
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,600
will advance and retreat together.

201
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
There will be no regret.

202
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,200
Ming.

203
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
If you want to leave,

204
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll find a way

205
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,800
to transfer you from Anna.

206
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,200
No need.

207
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,360
Why?

208
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,560
I want to stay with Ketun.

209
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,480
I have someone I want to see.

210
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,360
When we arrive at Dingxiang,

211
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I'll protect you.

212
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,080
Changge.

213
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
I know you hate me.

214
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
But I'm still your second uncle.

215
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
If you want,

216
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,040
I'll remember you under the empress's name

217
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,600
and the honor of having the same princess as Leyan.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You can live a happy life in Chang'an.

219
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,200
No one will force you to marry someone

220
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,760
or do anything you don't want to do.

221
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
So you'll let Sun go to Dingxiang alone

222
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
and face the unknown.

223
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,200
Face the unknown.

224
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
In order to have a peaceful life for me.

225
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,640
That's Sun Teqin's choice.

226
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,720
You should understand

227
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,720
what he's thinking.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
I don't want the wealth and glory of Chang'an.

229
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,040
I don't want the honor of having the princess.

230
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,840
Where is Sun?

231
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,480
Where am I?

232
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,920
Dingxiang is about to rain.

233
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,120
It's a crisis.

234
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
I can't let you take the risk.

235
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,280
Changge.

236
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
You're back home.

237
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,560
I won't let you go.

238
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,920
Back home?

239
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,280
In the court today,

240
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,560
my existence is just a hidden danger.

241
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,800
Why do you force me?

242
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,680
Or

243
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,200
you want to make up for it

244
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,080
to soothe your heart?

245
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
Make up for it?

246
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,480
Because of your mother's last wish.

247
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,640
She wants you to be safe.

248
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,840
This is your mother's only wish before she dies.

249
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,880
Mother?

250
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,000
I know this day

251
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,640
will come sooner or later.

252
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,640
I'll send you and your mother away.

253
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,720
From now on,

254
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
I'll arrange for you

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
to live your life as you want.

256
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,520
I'll be with you.

257
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
I'll be with you.

258
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
I'll be with you.

259
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I'll be with you.

260
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
I'll be with you.

261
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
I'll be with you.

262
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
I'll be with you.

263
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I'll be with you.

264
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,360
Now,

265
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,760
you treat me and Changge

266
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,080
as if we were in the past.

267
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,120
But

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,160
I can't enjoy it anymore.

269
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
Don't be too stubborn.

270
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
No one can control the court.

271
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
Even if there's no you,

272
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
maybe today

273
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
will be like this.

274
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,840
I...

275
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
I can't live this life.

276
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
That day,

277
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,760
I wrote you that letter.

278
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,520
I know

279
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
I can't go back.

280
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,800
The Crown Prince and I

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
never had a heart-to-heart.

282
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,320
He never treated me well.

283
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,160
But I

284
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,760
betrayed him.

285
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,320
I've done my best

286
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
to defend him.

287
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,320
I never saw her as if I was his own child.

288
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,920
Your Highness,

289
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
You've given me the power.

290
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,360
What can I say as a woman?

291
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,240
Back then,

292
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,800
you saved my life.

293
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,920
You treated Changge like a daughter.

294
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
You taught her how to be a man and how to do things.

295
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,200
Changge treated you like a father.

296
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,600
I can see that in your eyes.

297
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,160
Now,

298
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,520
I can't even

299
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
let it go.

300
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
That means

301
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,000
I get to private the honor of seeing you.

302
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,120
But Member Pirate Mo...

303
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,240
What do I get

304
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,720
to repay him?

305
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
However,

306
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
I still

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,720
have to thank you

308
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,240
Sheng Mei, Iged,

309
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,620
I'd lost idiom,

310
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,160
so I've lost a lot of wisdom.

311
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,140
I don't know why I was someone so young nowadays.

312
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,780
Thomas,

313
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,840
you and Group A must be more.

314
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,080
The most important thing is me!

315
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Now,

316
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,080
I can't see anyone.

317
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
A'Jing!

318
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
One is A'Ye,

319
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
the other is you.

320
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
No matter who dies,

321
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I can't live, right?

322
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Where is your letter?

323
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
I want to see it.

324
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Of course it was burned.

325
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
How could I leave evidence?

326
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
That letter is your mother's

327
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
gratitude to me.

328
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
In the two sides,

329
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
she finally chose to ask herself

330
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
to seek liberation.

331
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
In this life,

332
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
I have no regrets.

333
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
I can't remember

334
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
the pain

335
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
in my heart

336
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
for her.

337
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Changge,

338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
whether you believe it or not,

339
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
I never thought

340
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
about taking your life.

341
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I wanted to protect you,

342
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
but I didn't know where you were.

343
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,080
This life is full of ups and downs.

344
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
I didn't know many things.

345
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Later, I found out

346
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
that you had been wandering all the way,

347
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
and that you had been sacrificed

348
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
for Tang.

349
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I feel sorry for you.

350
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Changge,

351
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
stay.

352
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Let me take good care of you.

353
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
If you give me another chance,

354
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
I will still make the same choice.

355
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
I am willing to sacrifice myself

356
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
for the people of Tang.

357
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
But I can't let the people

358
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
who love me sacrifice for me.

359
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Dingxiang,

360
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
I must go.

361
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I should be happy

362
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
to hear that.

363
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
But now the war with Ashile Tribe

364
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
is provoking Dingxiang.

365
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
If you have to go,

366
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
then your mother's request

367
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
will be failed.

368
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
If you go,

369
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
maybe we will...

370
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Fine.

371
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
We are not

372
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
ordinary people.

373
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
We can't just ask

374
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
for the simplest happiness.

375
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Now Changge has grown up.

376
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
You have your own path to choose.

377
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I have no more words.

378
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
My child,

379
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
take care.

380
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
I will wait for you to come back.

381
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
This will always be your home.

382
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Uncle.

383
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
You killed my father.

384
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
You are my uncle.

385
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
If one day you are bad to the people,

386
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
I will come back to you.

387
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Okay.

388
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
I will wait for you to come back.

389
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
I will wait for you to come back.

390
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I will wait for you to come back.

391
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
I will wait for you to come back.

392
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
I will wait for you to come back.

393
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
I will wait for you to come back.

394
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I will wait for you to come back.

395
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
I will wait for you to come back.

396
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
I will wait for you to come back.

397
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
I will wait for you to come back.

398
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
Qin.

399
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Your daughter

400
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
misses you very much.

401
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Your Majesty.

402
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
This is Princess Yongning

403
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
from the Shi family's base in the palace.

404
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Your Majesty.

405
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Your Majesty.

406
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Mother.

407
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
So all of this

408
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
was your choice.

409
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I feel sorry for you

410
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
for bearing all of this alone.

411
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
It's just that Changge

412
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
understood it too late.

413
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
I came today

414
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
to say goodbye to you.

415
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
I want to save the person I love.

416
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
You will support me,

417
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
right?

418
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Yes.

419
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Mrs. Qin.

420
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
I, Ashile Sun,

421
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
want to spend the rest of my life

422
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
with your daughter Li Changge

423
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
and sing the song of love.

424
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
I swear

425
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
that I will be faithful to Changge

426
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
and love her forever.

427
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I will give her freedom

428
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
and happiness.

429
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I will never leave her.

430
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Ashile Sun.

431
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Jin Shang.

432
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
So he has come to see you.

433
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Mother.

434
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
This cup

435
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
is for my daughter to get married.

436
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
The second cup

437
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
is for Sun Jinning.

438
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
The third cup

439
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
is for mother.

440
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
From now on, Ashile Sun

441
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
is my wife.

442
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
I hope that

443
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
mother will bless Changge

444
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
and keep Sun safe.

445
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
The fourth cup

446
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Young Khan.

447
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
Hey.

448
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
What do you mean?

449
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Commander Lei has ordered

450
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
that Great Khan is seriously ill.

451
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
No one is allowed to enter.

452
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Who is Commander Lei?

453
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Who am I?

454
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Young Khan is here.

455
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
Hurry.

456
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Go and report to Commander Lei.

457
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
Yes.

458
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Go.

459
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
It's me.

460
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
It's me.

461
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
Shuhan.

462
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
What's wrong with you?

463
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Shuhan.

464
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
It's me. It's me.

465
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
You don't recognize me?

466
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Shuhan.

467
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
It's me.

468
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
It's me.

469
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
Okay.

470
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
I'll go.

471
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Leave.

472
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Yes.

473
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
You look

474
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
much better

475
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
than before.

476
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Thank you for your guidance.

477
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
As long as you listen to me,

478
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I will let you two meet.

479
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Thank you, Master.

480
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
But you have to remember

481
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
that when you return to Dingxiang,

482
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
you won't have a chance to make mistakes again.

483
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
I will.

484
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
I will.

485
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
You won't have a chance to make mistakes again.

486
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
If you don't listen to me,

487
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
you won't want to see your father again.

488
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
No.

489
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
I will listen to you.

490
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Your Highness.

491
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Young Khan came back

492
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
and went to the bed of Great Khan.

493
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
He can't stop anyone from going.

494
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Let him go.

495
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
But you have to be more careful

496
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
when you do things in the future.

497
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Don't make any unnecessary misunderstandings.

498
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Yes.

499
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Your Highness.

500
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
How free he is!

501
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Your Highness.

502
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
What are you doing?

503
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Your Highness.

504
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Just stay there.

505
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Buzhen.

506
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Your Highness.

507
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Go.

508
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
Let me go.

509
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Buzhen.

510
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Buzhen.

511
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Sister.

512
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
Sister.

513
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Buzhen.

514
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
Buzhen.

515
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
Let me see you.

516
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Sister.

517
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Your hand.

518
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
I don't know why

519
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
they all want to cut my finger.

520
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
It's still Prince Sui who saved me.

521
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
I'm fine.

522
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
It's good that you're fine.

523
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
It's good that you're fine.

524
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Commander Lei.

525
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
It's fine.

526
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
A news from the West.

527
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
It's fine, sister.

528
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
I've been fine for a long time.

529
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Don't cry, sister.

530
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Don't cry, sister.

531
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
I won't cry.

532
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I won't cry, sister.

533
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
Take Buzhen back.

534
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Yes.

535
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Sister.

536
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Go.

537
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Buzhen.

538
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Sister.

539
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Buzhen.

540
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Go.

541
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
Buzhen.

542
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
You.

543
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
Go back with me.

544
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Sister.

545
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Little Khan.

546
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Why are you here?

547
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Open the door.

548
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
I want to go in.

549
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Well...

550
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Well...

551
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Khatun told me.

552
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
What?

553
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
My words are useless in Dingxiang City.

554
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Little Khan, don't be angry.

555
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Tell him later.

556
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Don't report to Khatun

557
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
about my visit today.

558
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Yes.

559
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I understand.

560
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I won't let anyone talk nonsense.

561
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Take me to Ashile Village.

562
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Yes.

563
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Open the door.

564
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Yes.

565
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Little Khan, please.

566
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Go to the dungeon.

567
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
I want to see Ashile.

568
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
I can go by myself.

569
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes.

570
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
When do you like to go to the dungeon

571
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
and drink?

572
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
I like to see you

573
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
in the dungeon.

574
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Is there a better dish

575
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
than this in Dingxiang City?

576
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

577
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Go now.

578
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Or your father will find out.

579
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm here.

580
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Why can't I let him know?

581
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
That's not what you look like.

582
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Shut up.

583
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
I saw Big Khan.

584
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
How is he?

585
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
He's sick.

586
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Just like what Anna said.

587
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
He can't even recognize people.

588
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
He drove me away.

589
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Do you really believe

590
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
that Big Khan will get sick overnight?

591
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Why not?

592
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Stop talking nonsense.

593
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
I can't wait to see him.

594
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Then Anna

595
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
won't have to live on.

596
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
She can see me anytime.

597
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
What's wrong with that?

598
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
Stop lying to yourself, Sher.

599
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
If you really believe it,

600
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
why did you come to my place?

601
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
What do you think?

602
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
I've never left him like this before.

603
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:16,320
Somewhere in the

604
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,080
Ke Han, Khatun is here.

605
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,400
Leave now.

606
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Yes, Ke Han.

607
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
I let you in secretly.

608
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,800
If Khatun knows about this,

609
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
I'll be in a big trouble.

610
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,080
Don't panic.

611
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,200
Just walk from the back door.

612
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,200
Okay.

613
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,680
I'll take you out now.

614
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Keep your mouth shut.

615
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You won't fall off your head.

616
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,680
I know.

617
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,880
Please.

618
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:58,000
H QU Our Babes

619
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,200
Little Ke Han, would you be quick.

620
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,560
Come on.

621
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,120
Hurry up.

622
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,480
I know the way.

623
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,280
You go back first.

624
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,280
Or Ketun will be suspicious.

625
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Thank you, Ke Han.

626
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,840
Greetings, Ketun.

627
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
Why are you here?

628
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,840
I... I...

629
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I asked him to come.

630
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,120
I want to drink.

631
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,240
Bring me some wine.

632
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,040
Do you think

633
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,200
this is still your Eagle Division?

634
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,400
Leave.

635
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,320
Yes.

636
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,840
The war god

637
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,760
on the grassland

638
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,080
is now locked up

639
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
in this place where the sun is not visible.

640
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,720
To be honest,

641
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm a little reluctant.

642
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,680
Just say what you want to say.

643
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,440
Don't worry about it.

644
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,600
Ashile Sun is smart.

645
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,400
No wonder your father likes you.

646
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,280
My father likes Sher, too.

647
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,820
Even without your

648
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
anaesthetic,

649
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,480
Sher will be able to

650
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,640
gain the recognition of the grassland

651
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,240
with her own strength.

652
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I don't need you to comment

653
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,520
on how I pave the way for my son.

654
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,000
You love your son so much

655
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,080
that you took the wrong path.

656
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,200
I won't argue with you today.

657
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,200
I'm just talking to you about the conditions.

658
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,480
Conditions?

659
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,320
Li Tao and the other departments have allied.

660
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
Soon, the army will suppress the border.

661
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,400
Yicheng,

662
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
what right do you have to

663
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,520
negotiate with me?

664
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,880
Since you've guessed it,

665
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,440
I won't hide it from you.

666
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,080
You're a smart person.

667
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,200
You know the truth.

668
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,600
If you can make your Eagle Division

669
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,280
fight for the grassland,

670
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,280
I won't spare you.

671
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,360
If I gather Eagle Division,

672
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,480
I'm afraid it's not for the grassland.

673
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's for Khatun

674
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:38,000
and the so-called

675
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,200
Daimu Jin.

676
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,440
Really?

677
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
If it weren't for you,

678
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,920
Sher wouldn't have been threatened

679
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,320
on the grassland.

680
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,720
Ashile Sun,

681
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,680
aren't you being too righteous?

682
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
It's time for you to help your brother.

683
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
I won't help him.

684
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,120
I won't help you either.

685
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Fine.

686
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Daimu Jin.

687
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,780
A

688
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,120
kouros

689
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,680
-ry!

690
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,880
-ry!

691
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,440
Yicheng!

692
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,240
AASH1 Yoga

693
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,280
e holли

694
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,760
filmed directly in the putrid purchase,

695
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,240
we were simply punished by death.

696
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,640
It's also you

697
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Take him away.

698
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Yes.

699
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Wu Xie.

700
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
I promised you.

701
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
But I have two reasons.

702
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
What are they?

703
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Tell me.

704
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
First,

705
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
cure Mu Jin.

706
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Second,

707
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
cure Fu Han.

708
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
You have a good appetite.

709
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
I can promise you to cure Mu Jin first.

710
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
As for your father,

711
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
when the Eagle Division finished the battle for me,

712
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
I will let you two reunite.

713
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
You finally admit it.

714
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
You did cause my father's illness.

715
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Your voice

716
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,640
is locked in my tender dream.

717
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
Before dawn,

718
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
before the year,

719
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
my longing flows.

720
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,640
There is always a moment

721
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,640
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

722
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,640
There is always a longing

723
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,640
that unites us.

724
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
In different worlds,

725
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
in different worlds,

726
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I will be the cocoon in your memory.

727
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
The deep love

728
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
becomes eternity.

729
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,640
The cocoon in your memory.

730
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,640
There is always a moment

731
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,640
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

732
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,640
There is always a longing

733
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,640
that unites us.

734
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,640
In different worlds,

735
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,640
in different worlds,

736
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,640
I will be the cocoon in your memory.

737
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
The deep love

738
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
becomes eternity.

739
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,640
The cocoon in your memory.

740
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
The cocoon in your memory.

741
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
The cocoon in your memory.

742
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
The cocoon in your memory.

743
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,640
The cocoon in your memory.

744
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
The cocoon in your memory.

745
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
The cocoon in your memory.

746
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
The cocoon in your memory.

747
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
The cocoon in your memory.

748
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,640
The cocoon in your memory.

749
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
The cocoon in your memory.
