1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
To the distance

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Forgetting you

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
This is the way I am

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
To return to the long yearning in the past

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Climbing the river of life and the river of hope

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Episode 16

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Take her away.

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Stop.

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Isn't this the new military counselor?

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
What? You think you can get on our head

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
if the special forces can look down on you?

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
The grasslands have their own rules.

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Even if it's the special forces, they can't break the rules.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
What? You want to break it?

22
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
How about we do it together?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Let's do it together.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Get out of here.

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Did you hear that? I told you to get out of here.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Don't go.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Stay here.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I'll go.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Thank you.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Wipe your face. It's all on your face.

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I'll help you.

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
You look so pretty.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Drink some.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm Li Shisi.

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
What's your name?

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Li Mingbuli.

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
You look different from them.

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Aren't you from Ashile Tribe?

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm a slave of Ashile Tribe.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I have some men's clothes here.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
You can take them off first.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I'll change my clothes.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Go ahead. I'll wait for you outside.

44
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm done.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
What's in your clothes?

46
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I...

47
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I...

48
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I...

50
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I promise I won't steal anymore.

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I won't do it again.

53
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Please don't drive me away. I know a lot of things.

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Look. I can clean the house.

55
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I can wash and cook.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I can do everything. Look.

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm very fast.

58
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Don't hide anything anymore.

59
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I'll eat what you eat.

60
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Sleep here tonight.

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
That's my bed.

62
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I'll go out for a while.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Don't be scared even if someone calls you.

64
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll go out for a while.

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll go out for a while.

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll go out for a while.

67
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I'll go out for a while.

68
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll go out for a while.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I'll go out for a while.

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll go out for a while.

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I'll go out for a while.

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I'll go out for a while.

73
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I'll go out for a while.

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll go out for a while.

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I'll go out for a while.

76
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I'll go out for a while.

77
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I'll go out for a while.

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll go out for a while.

79
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I'll go out for a while.

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I'll go out for a while.

81
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I'll go out for a while.

82
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I'll go out for a while.

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'll go out for a while.

84
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I'll go out for a while.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll go out for a while.

86
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll go out for a while.

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll go out for a while.

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll go out for a while.

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll go out for a while.

90
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'll go out for a while.

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll go out for a while.

92
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll go out for a while.

93
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
The End

94
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
Pick a thread with your right hand.

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
Pick a thread with your left hand.

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Very good.

97
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Turn it over.

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
My wife wants to play this.

99
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
Li Leyan, are you stupid?

100
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Look at what they did.

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
What did you do to me?

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
Do you want to kill me?

103
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,200
I just want to put this on my head.

104
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
I want to see you.

105
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
I want to see you.

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I want to see you.

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I want to see you.

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I want to see you.

109
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I just want to untie this.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
You can't untie it tonight.

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
You can't sleep.

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Did God send you to make me a knot?

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
I'm so angry.

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Come on.

115
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Help me.

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
Zheng Ge, I don't understand.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,400
You've been learning for so many days.

118
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
What have you learned?

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Who?

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Why did you turn over my things?

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
I'm working.

122
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,800
You did all these?

123
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
If you don't like others touching your things,

124
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,000
I won't touch it anymore.

125
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Please don't drive me away.

127
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,400
It's her.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Li Shisi,

129
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
this woman can't stay here.

130
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
So what if she can't stay?

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you want to kill her?

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
Why do you have to waste your time?

133
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
Just drive her out.

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
I beg you.

135
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
Don't drive me out.

136
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,800
If I'm driven out,

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
the wolf will eat me.

138
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,800
Even if I can only escape,

139
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,400
if the Khan finds out I'm a fugitive,

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
he will kill me.

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Where did you get so much nonsense?

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,800
Go.

143
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
No.

144
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Are you a dog?

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,600
You bite people when you're up there?

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is that enough?

147
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
It's broken.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,800
Tao Qi,

149
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
can you leave this female slave to me?

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Leave.

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
In my place,

152
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
it's not good to take things

153
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
that have ears and mouths.

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Since I'm a person who works for Tegin,

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
I will take care of my people.

156
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't you believe me?

157
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm leaving.

158
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,400
I...

159
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
I was bitten for nothing.

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
What's wrong?

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Did you catch a cold last night?

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll get you some milk wine.

163
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Wait for me.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Su An.

165
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Although you agreed to

166
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
be the military counselor of Li's Temple,

167
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
I advise you to save some room for yourself.

168
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't trust him too much.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm not a man.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm a man.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm a man.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm a man.

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a man.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm a man.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm a man.

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Don't trust him too much.

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Why?

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
He has a strange background.

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I know his background.

180
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
But he's not from our grassland.

181
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
He is now.

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
But the people of the Central Plains

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
are always very thoughtful.

184
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Su An,

185
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't mean anything else.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you okay?

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm fine.

188
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Here.

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Drink some hot soup.

190
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It's good for your health.

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Only mine?

192
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Why aren't you hungry?

193
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm not hungry.

194
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You hurry up and drink.

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You drink.

196
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I don't have much appetite.

197
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,400
You go to sleep after drinking.

198
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Although the bed is a little smaller,

199
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
you should be more reserved.

200
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
No need.

201
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I'm fine.

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
No need.

203
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll just sleep on the floor.

204
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
You should rest earlier.

205
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
So that you can get better.

206
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Whatever.

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
But you don't have to be so reserved.

208
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I won't hurt you.

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Don't Stope

210
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,400
Anniang, don't go.

211
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Anniang.

212
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Anniang.

213
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,540
Tell me if you have my order!

214
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,480
Why?

215
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,160
Something Long Long 꾖槃

216
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,180
Just a thought

217
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,960
Or not

218
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,680
Acting

219
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I'm leaving.

220
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Wait a minute.

221
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Wait a minute.

222
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Wait a minute.

223
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Stop.

224
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Stop.

225
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Stop.

226
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I have something to tell you.

227
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I have something to tell you.

228
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Me?

229
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
You are not allowed to run around in the camp.

230
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Especially not allowed to get close to Sun Tegin's tent.

231
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Let's get back to work.

232
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
How could you do this?

233
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Don't come over.

234
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm not going to run around.

235
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm not going to run around.

236
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm not going to run around.

237
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm not going to run around.

238
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm not going to run around.

239
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Don't come over.

240
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
You want to bite me again?

241
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
I'm warning you not to run around.

242
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Otherwise, I'll be rude to you.

243
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I really have something to tell you.

244
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm living with Li Junshi now.

245
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
The food is not enough for us to eat.

246
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
You have to prepare some food for us.

247
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
What are you doing with me?

248
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Go to Li Junshi.

249
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
We are eating here.

250
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Come on.

251
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Fill it up.

252
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Fill it up.

253
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
We are here.

254
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Why are you following me?

255
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Li Junshi is sick.

256
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
He gave me the last food yesterday.

257
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
We need to eat.

258
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
There are all kinds of food in every tent.

259
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
You've already taken it.

260
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
You can't take it.

261
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Get out of the way.

262
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You...

263
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I...

264
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I'm almost done.

265
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Sit.

266
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
By the way,

267
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
do you Tang people like to use this?

268
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I made it with branches.

269
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I hope you like it.

270
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
It's a custom.

271
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I don't use this anymore.

272
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
But I like your gift.

273
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Thank you.

274
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
You are online.

275
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Do you have anything you want?

276
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Me?

277
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Is that your family?

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Do you want to get back to your family

279
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
and get back to your family?

280
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
My family

281
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
was invaded by Ashile Tribe.

282
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm dead.

283
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm gone.

284
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I don't have a family anymore.

285
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
So I'm really grateful

286
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
that you let me stay with you.

287
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
You are also like this.

288
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Also?

289
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Could it be

290
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
your family...

291
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
My family is also dead.

292
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
They were killed by the enemy.

293
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Let's not talk about these unhappy things.

294
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Since we can meet in this situation,

295
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
it's fate.

296
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
From now on,

297
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
you can treat me as your family.

298
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Here.

299
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
This is for you.

300
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm so tired.

301
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
It's almost done.

302
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
How about taking a rest?

303
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I think it's fine.

304
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I'm so tired.

305
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm so tired.

306
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You are tired.

307
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Don't you know that you have to deliver the goods tomorrow?

308
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Have you finished your work?

309
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
If you can't deliver the goods,

310
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
get out of here.

311
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Hurry up and continue to do it.

312
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I'm so tired.

313
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm so tired.

314
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm so tired.

315
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm so tired.

316
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm so tired.

317
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm so tired.

318
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Mrs. Zhang.

319
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Don't be so...

320
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Lin Leyan, did you do it on purpose?

321
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Get out of here.

322
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Get her out of here.

323
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Hurry up.

324
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Hurry up.

325
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Get out of here.

326
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Get her out of here.

327
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Get her out of here.

328
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Get out of here.

329
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Get out of here.

330
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Isn't Lin Leyan really stupid?

331
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
She is really stupid.

332
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm so tired.

333
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm finally able to get Mr. Hu's job done.

334
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Everyone, have a rest.

335
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Why hasn't she left yet?

336
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
That's right.

337
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
The money is here.

338
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Why hasn't she left yet?

339
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Why hasn't she left yet?

340
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Why hasn't she left yet?

341
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
That's right.

342
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Mrs. Chai, I'm sorry.

343
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Please give me another chance.

344
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Please.

345
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
This Miss Li is really a stubborn person.

346
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
I really need someone like her.

347
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
This is...

348
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
This is...

349
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Do you think I would say this when I'm on vacation?

350
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I can stay and eat out with my cousin.

351
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm really lucky.

352
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I still have to meet Mr. Hu later.

353
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm begging you.

354
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Just leave.

355
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
My temple is too small.

356
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
You can go to another place and harm others.

357
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
You want to cry again?

358
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Look at them.

359
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
They didn't sleep at all for you.

360
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
They want to cry again.

361
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Tears are not worth the money.

362
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Money is earned by both hands.

363
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
If I were your mother, I would have been beaten to death.

364
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Hurry and leave.

365
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
It's best to find a tree to hang on the tree.

366
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
People like you,

367
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
if you stay in the world, you will only eat for free.

368
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Waste food.

369
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
This...

370
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
They really don't want to leave?

371
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
What are they saying?

372
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Why are you looking at me?

373
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
If she really has the guts,

374
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
she will die a terrible death.

375
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Such a useless person,

376
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
if she stays in the world, she will be a waste.

377
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Enough.

378
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Go back to sleep.

379
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
So tired.

380
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Let's go.

381
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
So tired.

382
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Did you hear?

383
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Xiaojun is a very good person.

384
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
He is a very good person.

385
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
He is a very good person.

386
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Did you hear?

387
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Xiaojun's slave

388
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
kicked Mu Jin out of the house.

389
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Really?

390
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Really.

391
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Xiaojun's slave

392
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
is really fierce.

393
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Mu Jin

394
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
is still weak.

395
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
He is really good.

396
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
He is really miserable.

397
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
He is really shameless.

398
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Does it smell good?

399
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Why is it so fragrant today?

400
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
My child loves to eat.

401
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Mimi Guli,

402
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
go and wash clothes for your man.

403
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Yes.

404
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Yes.

405
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I...

406
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
By the way, Mimi Guli,

407
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
we have heard about you hitting Mu Jin.

408
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Mu Jin is a military counselor.

409
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Did he bother you?

410
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
No.

411
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
He dared to try me.

412
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
That's good.

413
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Then you wash it quickly.

414
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Yes.

415
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
We are leaving.

416
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
We are leaving first.

417
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
You are busy.

418
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Bye.

419
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Did you fall ill?

420
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Pick it up for me.

421
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I won't.

422
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
You and Li Shisi

423
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
made my face totally empty.

424
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
You two are pretty good.

425
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
It's you who is lack of ability.

426
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Who are you talking about?

427
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I am talking about you.

428
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
It's you.

429
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Say it again.

430
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Who are you talking about?

431
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
It's you.

432
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I am talking about you.

433
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Who do you think you are?

434
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,360
You!

435
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,840
You're so annoying.

436
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,800
You're a womanizer.

437
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
You're a womanizer.

438
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
You're a womanizer.

439
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,440
You're a womanizer.

440
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
You! You!

441
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
I think you and Li Shisi

442
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320
are not good people.

443
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,320
Who are you talking about?

444
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,760
You two.

445
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
How dare you talk about Shisi?

446
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,120
You can't hit me. You can't kick me.

447
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,200
You can't kick me.

448
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,640
Bastard!

449
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,560
Why was my heart beating so fast?

450
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,040
Mother, are you stupid?

451
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,920
She's from Li Shisi.

452
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,800
What are you thinking about?

453
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,040
Brother Cang.

454
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,840
I heard from others that

455
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,160
when you fall to your death,

456
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,120
your tongue will be so long.

457
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
If I were to enter your dream,

458
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
would you be afraid?

459
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
I'm afraid.

460
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I'm afraid.

461
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm afraid.

462
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm afraid.

463
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm afraid.

464
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm afraid.

465
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm afraid.

466
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
You're talking too much.

467
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,920
Are you going to die or not?

468
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,520
That's how you fall to your death.

469
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
If you're like that,

470
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,040
just practice your martial arts.

471
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,040
A man like you

472
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,840
used to think he was useless.

473
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
You can't live with a young man.

474
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,040
You should just die.

475
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
That's how your life is.

476
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
If someone asks you to die,

477
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
you really die.

478
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
If you want to die,

479
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
no one can stop you.

480
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
If you want to live,

481
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,040
no one can stop you.

482
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
You have to depend on yourself.

483
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Understand?

484
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,240
Okay, okay.

485
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Enough, enough.

486
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Enough, enough.

487
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm a little harsh.

488
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,160
I apologize to you.

489
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,760
Thank you, Madam Chai.

490
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Mr. Hu, look.

491
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
New style from last month.

492
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Come, this way.

493
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Western style.

494
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
It's very popular.

495
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Yes.

496
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Not bad.

497
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Look at this side.

498
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Look at this embroidery.

499
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
This is gold thread.

500
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Look at this.

501
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
It's very beautiful.

502
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
It's very beautiful.

503
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
It's very beautiful.

504
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
This is gold thread.

505
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Look at this needle.

506
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
It's very dense.

507
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Yes.

508
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Not bad.

509
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
This is the goods you ordered this time.

510
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I heard that Madam Chai

511
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
made a very delicate blanket.

512
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Why this time

513
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
I ordered this batch

514
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
and the needle is not flat?

515
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
If you give us more time,

516
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
we can do better.

517
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Mr. Hu,

518
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
please be generous.

519
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Yes.

520
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Who made this?

521
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
This is...

522
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
I told you to stay out of this.

523
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
She...

524
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Mr. Hu,

525
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
she made this.

526
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Right?

527
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Miss Lin.

528
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
You made this?

529
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
I made this.

530
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Not bad.

531
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Really.

532
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
This is gold thread.

533
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Look at this.

534
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
The needle is not flat.

535
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
It's very delicate.

536
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
It's very delicate.

537
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
This is gold thread.

538
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
I bought this.

539
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Miss Jiang,

540
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
can you make more

541
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
and sell them to me?

542
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
The price is good.

543
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
As long as you agree,

544
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I'll accept

545
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
the first batch.

546
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
I'll accept them all.

547
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
This is

548
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
the embroiderer here.

549
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
As for the handkerchief,

550
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
as long as the price is good,

551
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
you can have as much as you want.

552
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Okay.

553
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
You can decide the price.

554
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
So great.

555
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Jiang Lin,

556
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
eat more.

557
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Eat more.

558
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Eat.

559
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Eat.

560
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Why did you bring me out

561
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
to eat roast lamb leg today?

562
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Your slave almost got into a fight

563
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
with Mu Jin

564
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
because of a lamb leg.

565
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
You are my teacher.

566
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I don't want others to feel

567
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
I treat you badly.

568
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
You used to

569
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
roast lamb leg for Mu Jin?

570
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
No.

571
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
This is the first time.

572
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
When I was a kid,

573
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
my father took me to roast lamb.

574
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
I had to roast it myself.

575
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
I was so confused.

576
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
I ate all of it.

577
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Then my father

578
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
ate all the roasted part.

579
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
So I tried to learn to roast lamb leg.

580
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
I didn't want to disappoint him.

581
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
I didn't expect

582
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
you and your father

583
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
have such a story.

584
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
When I was a kid,

585
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
my father still cared about me.

586
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
But later...

587
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Don't just talk about me.

588
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Talk about your father.

589
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I have nothing to say.

590
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
He rarely company me.

591
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
No wonder.

592
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
He is the crown prince after all.

593
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
It's normal to be busy.

594
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I know you.

595
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
When did you know?

596
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
When you entered the official's mansion

597
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
freely in Youzhou,

598
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
I knew you were not an ordinary person.

599
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Later,

600
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
I heard them call you princess Yong Ning.

601
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I knew everything.

602
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Since you knew my identity,

603
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
you didn't expose me

604
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
to use me?

605
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Yes.

606
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I used you.

607
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
I used you

608
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
to torture myself.

609
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
I saved you in Chang'an,

610
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
in Youzhou,

611
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
and in Shuozhou.

612
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Now in the grasslands,

613
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
I am giving you a slave to roast lamb leg.

614
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
I used you so well.

615
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
What?

616
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Don't you forget it?

617
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
No.

618
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Eat.

619
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
In front of the dawn,

620
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
before the years,

621
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
I am already a dead man

622
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
in Tang.

623
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
I can do nothing.

624
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
I won't be Li Shisi anymore.

625
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I am Li Changge.

626
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
I like the name Changge.

627
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Changge.

628
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Changge.

629
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Inside a world,

630
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,820
Doctor.

631
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,620
In different worlds,

632
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,620
I have lured myself into a world far far away.

633
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
Wrapped up in some deep lingering love,

634
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
it attacked and swallowed me.

635
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,620
A dream upon a upwards gold boon.

636
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
What is he doing?

637
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,120
Does he want to give me an body and body caidentally?

638
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,180
Such men

639
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
at least would stand up to fight

640
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,180
in a blackout at this time of night.

641
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,520
You're not doing well.

642
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,320
You...

643
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,920
Brother Cheng.

644
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,440
Brother Cheng.

645
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,800
Brother Cheng, you...

646
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,960
What is he doing in the middle of the night?

647
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,720
I...

648
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,520
Shi Silan, what's wrong with you?

649
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't know what's going on either.

650
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,240
It just happened.

651
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,360
Are you feeling unwell?

652
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,840
Lie down first.

653
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,480
Blood?

654
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,760
Why is there blood?

655
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,760
Mimi.

656
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,160
Lie down first.

657
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
What's wrong with Li Jun?

658
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,240
Is he hurt?

659
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,880
It's okay.

660
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,440
He's fine.

661
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,200
He's fine.

662
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,840
He...

663
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,640
He looks so hurt.

664
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,400
Mr. Zhou.

665
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,360
No.

666
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,400
He looks so hurt.

667
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
He's hurt.

668
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,560
I told you he's fine.

669
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,800
But he clearly...

670
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Could it be...

671
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,400
Could it be...

672
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,560
I told you.

673
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,840
You're not like him.

674
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,800
You knew he was a girl.

675
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,440
You're getting more and more rude.

676
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,240
Brother Cheng is weak.

677
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,960
We have to give him some tonic.

678
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,200
Brother Cheng?

679
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,800
The name of the Fourteenth Wolf.

680
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,160
So the Fourteenth Wolf is called Brother Cheng.

681
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,080
How many secrets do you have to hide from me?

682
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,400
Tell me.

683
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,120
Sun.

684
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,800
Sun.

685
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
I thought you were a man.

686
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,800
I thought I'd entrust the rest of my life to you.

687
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,480
Why are you laughing?

688
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,360
You can't laugh.

689
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,160
I'm really sad.

690
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,520
Mimi.

691
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,720
You can still treat me like a family.

692
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Nothing is different.

693
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,560
But it's still different.

694
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,920
What's different?

695
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,560
I found out that you're not like a man.

696
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,320
But you really don't have the self-awareness of a woman.

697
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
In this world, men have to fight.

698
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,320
To protect their territory and women.

699
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,320
And women have to find strong men's reputation.

700
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,840
To protect the elderly and children.

701
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,880
And you...

702
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,920
You always use the way of men to kill them.

703
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,880
But you use a woman's body.

704
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,560
What do you think?

705
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,200
I don't know what I think.

706
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,640
I'm a man.

707
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
I'm a woman.

708
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,960
I've never been to the right place to ask this question.

709
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
The men are all men.

710
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,400
They have good culture and good culture.

711
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,280
They are all brilliant and brilliant.

712
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
They are the best in the world.

713
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,760
But I'm different from them.

714
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,560
The women are all women.

715
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,520
They are all beautiful and beautiful.

716
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,360
They are all very thoughtful.

717
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,040
But...

718
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,160
I don't deserve this.

719
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,600
Anyway,

720
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
you should stay at home these days.

721
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,280
Don't go out with them.

722
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,480
You'll be in the wild.

723
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,280
No.

724
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,480
You lied to me.

725
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,680
You won't call me Shisi.

726
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,480
I'll call you Li Changge.

727
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,480
Li Changge?

728
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,560
So,

729
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,320
does Sun Tegin know about this?

730
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,880
He's been hiding it for you.

731
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,600
Maybe he likes you.

732
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,720
What are you talking about?

733
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,160
He just knows I'm useful to him.

734
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,800
So he cares about me.

735
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,320
Do you feel better?

736
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Do you feel better?

737
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,760
I feel better.

738
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,800
Why are you still standing here?

739
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,120
Move it.

740
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,920
It's the easiest job.

741
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,520
Can you do it?

742
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,040
I can.

743
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,800
Why are you still standing here?

744
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,160
Come and help me.

745
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,960
Here they are.

746
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,720
Come on.

747
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,200
Here.

748
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,200
Harder.

749
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,840
Here.

750
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,200
Here.

751
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,680
Here.

752
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,640
Here.

753
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,600
You're so stupid.

754
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,040
You're so stupid.

755
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,800
Stupid.

756
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,640
Stupid.

757
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,080
You're so stupid.

758
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,840
Stupid.

759
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,320
Are you stupid?

760
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
You're so stupid.

761
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,960
Look.

762
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,480
You're so stupid.

763
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,560
Lady Chai, I...

764
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,680
Look at your head.

765
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,600
It's okay.

766
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,160
You...

767
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
This silly girl can't do anything.

768
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
How did she survive?

769
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,760
Exactly.

770
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,800
Thank you, ladies.

771
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm happy to live until now

772
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,120
because of a noble lady like you.

773
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,400
It's the first time someone says I'm a noble lady.

774
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,520
Are you the one who said that?

775
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,960
Count your salary.

776
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,240
You're not a noble lady at all.

777
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Why not?

778
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,040
Then my family's Yang Zhi

779
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,720
is still in the Zhou family.

780
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,840
You're not a noble lady.

781
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,040
You're not a noble lady.

782
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
You're not a noble lady.

783
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,120
You're still in the Zhou family.

784
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,280
Maybe

785
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,440
you'll be the first one in the palace

786
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,720
to be a noble lady.

787
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,720
You're so selfish.

788
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,240
They may not

789
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,080
cherish your loyalty.

790
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,160
Why do you say that?

791
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,320
They're born with no worries.

792
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,040
Who knows how much

793
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,440
they've suffered under good clothes?

794
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,760
God is fair.

795
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,960
The people in the palace

796
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
are worshiped by the world.

797
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,240
They're blessed with good fortune and rain.

798
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,560
They're the ones

799
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,120
who have to bear the world's people.

800
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,560
What about us?

801
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,720
We're poor,

802
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,960
but we can manage our money.

803
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
Right?

804
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,720
Yes.

805
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,400
We can manage everything.

806
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
We can do whatever we want.

807
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,480
If we can't, we'll just sleep.

808
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,720
If the saints and the monks can't do it well,

809
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,600
how can they sleep?

810
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,480
We're just

811
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,120
playing the music.

812
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Yes.

813
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,760
Do what you should do.

814
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,240
Don't run away when you talk about money.

815
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,640
Right.

816
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,200
Get back to work.

817
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,000
You're talking about money?

818
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,840
Don't run away.

819
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,160
I'm telling you,

820
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,920
if you don't make money,

821
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,120
you'll have to buy some sweet potatoes.

822
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,160
Don't run away.

823
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,280
Don't run away.

824
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,800
Liao Yan,

825
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
I must find you.

826
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,560
Mimi,

827
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,800
you're a girl.

828
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,200
Don't work too hard.

829
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,080
In the future,

830
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
you can invite me to work with you.

831
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,000
I'll help you with the water.

832
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,880
Don't look at me.

833
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm good at it.

834
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,520
Look.

835
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,240
Be careful.

836
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
I'm not a girl.

837
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
I'm not a girl.

838
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm not a girl.

839
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm not a girl.

840
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
I'm not a girl.

841
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,960
Be careful.

842
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Don't hurt your clothes.

843
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,280
What's wrong?

844
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,080
Is it too heavy?

845
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,240
No.

846
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
My feet.

847
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
You're bleeding.

848
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm so unlucky.

849
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Who threw that broken nail?

850
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm fine.

851
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,200
Don't blame me.

852
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
You go back first.

853
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,640
I'll take a break.

854
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
I'll take you back.

855
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Put the things here.

856
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Be careful.

857
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm fine.

858
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
I'm fine.

859
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Be careful.

860
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
You're just a little bit better.

861
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,640
Don't let the wind blow you down.

862
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Don't worry.

863
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
I'm not that weak.

864
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Keep it.

865
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
I'll wear it when it's cold.

866
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
You haven't done anything yet.

867
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
I don't want to do the company business.

868
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Don't worry.

869
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,640
I'll finish the three things that I promised you.

870
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Do you have anything to tell me?

871
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
I just passed by.

872
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
Alone?

873
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Where's the woman next to you?

874
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
She went to wash clothes.

875
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
She's lucky

876
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
to meet a master like you.

877
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
We're not masters.

878
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
We're friends who cherish each other.

879
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
People around us

880
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
will always leave one by one.

881
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Trusting someone new

882
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
and saying goodbye to an old friend

883
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
are all difficult things in life.

884
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Instead of saying she's lucky,

885
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
it's better to say it's me.

886
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
I'm so lucky

887
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
to meet someone I want to cherish.

888
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
Me too.

889
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Go to the camp, Tegin.

890
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Or the sun will set.

891
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Why don't you come with me?

892
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
You haven't learned much about this prairie.

893
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
After it gets dark,

894
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
I'll take you to a place.

895
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I just don't know if you dare.

896
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Why not?

897
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
I'll go with you.

898
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
It's beautiful.

899
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
I found it when I was in the camp.

900
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Do you like it?

901
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
This should be the last time

902
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
I saw the firefly this year.

903
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
There will be more next year.

904
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Who knows where it is next year?

905
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Do you have a chance to see the firefly again?

906
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
If you still want to see it next year,

907
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
just tell me.

908
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
I'll help you

909
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
no matter where it is.

910
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
I'm afraid I can't do it.

911
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Besides,

912
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
such a beautiful thing as a firefly

913
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
is all in a flash.

914
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
So why wait?

915
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
I'll go with you.

916
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
I'll go with you.

917
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
I'll go with you.

918
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
I'll go with you.

919
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
I'll go with you.

920
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
I'll go with you.

921
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I'll go with you.

922
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I'll go with you.

923
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
I'll go with you.

924
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
I'll go with you.

925
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
I'll go with you.

926
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I'll go with you.

927
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
I'll go with you.

928
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
I'll go with you.

929
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I'll go with you.

930
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,640
I'll go with you.

931
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,640
I'll go with you.

932
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
I'll go with you.

933
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
I'll go with you.

934
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I'll go with you.

935
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
I'll go with you.

936
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
I'll go with you.

937
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'll go with you.

938
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I'll go with you.

939
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
I'll go with you.

940
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
I'll go with you.

941
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
I'll go with you.

942
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I'll go with you.

943
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
I'll go with you.

944
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I'll go with you.

945
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
I'll go with you.

946
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I'll go with you.

947
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I'll go with you.

948
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I'll go with you.

949
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
I'll go with you.

950
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
