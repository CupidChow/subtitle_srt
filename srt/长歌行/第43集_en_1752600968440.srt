The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
When did he give Zhixi breakfast?

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Zhixi.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why didn't you answer me?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Zhixi.

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Zhixi.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Help!

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Something happened! Help!

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Help!

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hurry!

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Help!

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Wait.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Is he poisoned?

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Lift him up.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Help!

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Princess Mobei.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Even if Zhixi doesn't want to help,

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you don't have to do it again.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Princess Mobei.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It was Princess Mobei who did it.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm talking nonsense.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm talking nonsense.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not talking nonsense.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I saw the maid of Princess Mobei

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
gave Zhixi a breakfast.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Zhixi died.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Everyone was cursing.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Only Zhixi didn't accept the alliance agreement.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You killed him.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is too vicious.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What if the Mo family and the other tribes don't accept it?

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you want to kill them all?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Will he kill us all?

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Everyone leave first.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This case happened in our Tang.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Of course, it's my people in the court who are responsible for it.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You came just in time.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The murderer

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is the maid of Princess Mobei.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She sent Zhixi a breakfast.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
After I went in,

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
she was dead.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who else could it be?

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Be quiet, messenger.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Since I'm here,

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll find out the truth.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll give an explanation to the messengers.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Get up.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What did you find?

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's about the case.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No one can tell you.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Goodbye.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll go.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Wei,

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
why are you hesitating?

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Since we found the evidence,

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
we can report it directly.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Even if we're afraid of involving Princess Mobei,

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
we can't hide it.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Princess Mobei

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
is the leader of the Su family.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If she's suspected,

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the treaty will be affected.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But we can't hide it.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If Tang is in danger,

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
it will really affect the foundation of the alliance.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The place is closed.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No one is allowed to enter.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A maid

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
could poison someone here.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Tell me.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is she the messenger behind you?

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't be so rude.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't make a scene.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You killed someone.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can't you tell me?

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Since you want your maid

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
to be your servant,

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll help you.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Xiao Ge.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Xiao Ge.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You've lost all the gifts

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
for a woman

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
who was stabbed

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
in the middle of the hall.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're all warriors of different tribes.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're all soldiers

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
who are the most powerful.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're all warriors of different tribes.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You killed the enemy on the battlefield.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When did you become interested in bullying women?

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Calm down.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We found a bottle of poison

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
from this maid's room.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
After the tea party,

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
the messenger died of this poison.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What else can you say

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
about the evidence?

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What else can you say?

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I told you

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
not to bully women.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Xiao Kehan.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you going to protect the real murderer?

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I didn't finish what I said just now.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Although the bottle was found

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
in this maid's room,

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
it doesn't belong to this maid.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This bottle

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
belongs to A'Shiluo's Xiao Kehan.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The houses in the Central Plains

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
are made of wood.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The insects are all there.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I prepared this bottle of poison.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The poison is mine.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I did give it to Zhixi.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Xiao Kehan.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This...

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is really yours.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But I saw this maid

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
walk out of Zhixi's room.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now, I have to search her room.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
How can I explain this?

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You mean

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I instigated this maid

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to assassinate Zhixi.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Then I framed her.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm just telling you

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the truth.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Everyone.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There are many doubts in this case.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We will investigate it one by one

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
to clear everyone's name.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are all important guests of Tang.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We will treat you with respect.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Before the case is solved,

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Xiao Kehan is not allowed to leave the room.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Tang Jun will keep an eye on him

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and cooperate with the interrogation at any time.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This maid

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
is not allowed to leave the Four-way Hall.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If she runs away without permission,

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the murderer will be punished.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Xiao Kehan.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Please.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Good.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If such a peaceful life

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
can go on,

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
it will be fine.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I hope every citizen of Tang

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
has food and clothing.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sure.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
His Majesty is generous and generous.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Tang will be in peace.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Lao Zhang.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let me help you.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you okay?

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm fine.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My grandson is waiting for me to cook.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Lao Zhang.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me help you.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I can't do it.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You should accompany your wife.

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Lao Zhang.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't disobey your wife's order.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let me help you.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you.

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I've met a good person.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've always thought

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that I was in a relationship with his mother and son.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I finally realized

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that it wasn't like that.

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Sher

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
has left me for too long.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He never knew

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
what I was doing.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He never knew

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
what I was doing.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He never knew

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
what I was doing.

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What do you mean?

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He stood up today

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
to make up for Mimi Gu's sin

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
by punishing me,

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the mother,

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for being innocent.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Should I punish him

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
or punish myself?

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Your Highness.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't worry.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll definitely handle this.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll make sure that the little Khan is safe.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
By the way,

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
bring Sheng Xin here tomorrow.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's too late.

203
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There are too many dreams.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We need to make a move.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Changge.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to see Sher.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Can you help me ask Mr. Wei

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to let me see Sher?

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why do you want to see him?

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I didn't expect

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that he would stand up to make up for me.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
When I was a kid,

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was his playmate

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and slave.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But he really treated me as a friend.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He was actually quite pitiful.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll help you.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But you have to come back as soon as you see him.

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't let anyone know.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Stop.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why are you here?

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm afraid that you can't finish the food in Tang.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So I made you mutton noodles.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Eat it while it's hot.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll make it for you.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll go and get some food.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll go and get some food.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay.

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's delicious.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why are you blaming me?

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You'll make Ketun unhappy.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Aren't you afraid that you'll ruin Ashile Tribe's reputation?

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I...

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Sher.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Mimi.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's been a long time since I ate the food you made.

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What on earth are you doing?

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why did you admit that the poison was yours?

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
How do you know it wasn't mine?

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Did you really poison it?

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The Mimi I know

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is a kind,

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
warm-hearted,

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and weak-minded woman.

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How could she kill someone?

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Since I was a kid,

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
everyone has been respectful to me.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's just because I'm a little Khan.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Only you

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
really treat me like a friend.

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's the time I miss very much.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Since you left,

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I've never given my heart to anyone.

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I just want to protect the person

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to protect

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
for this matter.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sher.

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But we can't do that.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's my business.

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm leaving.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm leaving.

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sher.

270
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In fact, in this world,

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
many people are not like what you see on the surface.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
For example,

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
just like me.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe...

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Maybe I'm not as kind as you think.

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I hope

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
you won't judge anything

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
based on your heart.

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you're different from other people on the grasslands.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm leaving.

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm leaving.

283
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm leaving.

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm leaving.

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm leaving.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm leaving.

287
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm leaving.

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm leaving.

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm leaving.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm leaving.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm leaving.

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm leaving.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm leaving.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm leaving.

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm leaving.

296
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What are you doing?

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Wipe it clean.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Okay, okay, okay.

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Kehan.

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Kehan.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Kehan.

302
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Kehan.

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm Mu Jin.

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Kehan.

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Kehan.

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Kehan.

307
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let me ask you.

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
If you're the one,

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
just blink.

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yicheng did this to you.

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Now,

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Ashile Tribe

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
is under Yicheng's control.

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Commander Lei.

315
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is Great Khan awake?

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Commander,

317
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
he's still asleep.

318
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Kehan,

319
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
this is Dingxiang.

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is the one who followed the King of Sui

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
also here?

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Kehan.

323
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm alone now.

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't save you.

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But I'll find a way

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
to inform Sun.

327
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Sun is not dead.

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If he knows

330
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
your situation now,

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
he'll definitely come to save you.

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Kehan.

333
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's go.

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Go.

335
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Go.

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I lent you the jade seal.

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You know

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
it's not that simple.

339
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Changge.

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The Eight-leaf Ancient Tribe

341
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
has admitted

342
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
that he took Ashile Tribe

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Kehan's medicine

344
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and put it in your maid's seal.

345
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If this happens,

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the real murderer

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
can only be him.

348
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't believe

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you'll use Ashile Sher

350
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
to open the door.

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Since you're going to

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
hold the murderer back,

353
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you can't

354
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
hold the situation back.

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But she's already killed herself.

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Wei Shuyu.

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Sometimes,

358
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
what you see

359
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
is not what you hear

360
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but what you hear.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It must be the truth.

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The truth.

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Changge.

364
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Not all truths

365
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
should be followed.

366
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Sometimes, the truth

367
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
only brings more trouble.

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What are you afraid of?

369
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Nothing is more important

370
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
than the Alliance now.

371
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's end it here.

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Besides,

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
your maid

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is really not that simple.

375
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
She's not clean.

376
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You should be more careful.

377
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You'd better not stay by her side.

378
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I know what I should do.

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I advise you not to trust others.

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The most hurtful person

381
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
is usually

382
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
the one who is close to you.

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm just worried about you

384
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
as a friend.

385
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Now I'm with you.

386
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The one who protects you

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and never leaves you

388
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
is not a friend of Tang.

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I trust them.

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They trust me too.

391
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It has nothing to do

392
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
with Tang or the grasslands.

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Changge.

394
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm just worried about you.

395
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm not sick.

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're wrong.

397
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
If you were talking about Sun,

398
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I could have told you clearly

399
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that whether it was him

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
or the maid you mentioned,

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Mimi,

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
they are all my friends.

403
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They are worth my life.

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've been through a lot.

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I know that

406
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
this world is not black and white.

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Some people have their own difficulties.

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If I must make this trust

409
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
worth it,

410
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll accept it.

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Your Highness.

412
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You guys.

413
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Why are you so blind?

414
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Your Highness.

415
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If you're curious about

416
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what the Four-Legendary Soul looks like,

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
tell me.

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll take you here.

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have to walk so many paths.

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
My feet hurt.

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
My feet hurt.

426
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Why are you following me?

427
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I have relatives here.

428
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I happen to be here to have a look.

429
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Relatives?

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We're going to be together.

431
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
These deserts

432
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
will be our family.

433
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's go.

434
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Your Highness.

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I want to go to the toilet.

436
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Toilet?

437
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Go.

438
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The Four-Legendary Soul

439
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Li Changge!

440
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's boring.

441
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You've been like this.

442
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If you scare your sister,

443
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
she'll cry.

444
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You should try to scare your dad.

445
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You'll cry instead.

446
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You're really boring.

447
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You always mention your dad to me.

448
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I didn't tell him you were here.

449
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You're so mean.

450
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You're so shameless.

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He knows everything.

452
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
He needs you to tell him.

453
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Your sister's wedding is about to be fixed.

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
If you're free,

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
go back and help her.

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I have something to do.

457
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't bother me.

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I can't marry the adopted son

459
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that sister wants to marry Minister Du.

460
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I hope the best man in the world

461
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
can marry my sister.

462
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Why are you looking at me like this?

463
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I can understand now

464
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
why your dad wants to marry you.

465
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Of course it's because

466
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
he's a man with good culture,

467
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
good taste,

468
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and a good reputation.

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
He's the rarest man in the world.

470
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't go.

471
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Then,

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
tell me why your dad wants to marry me.

473
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Although you're not free...

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Shut up.

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You're not smart and you're not capable.

476
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But you always see the good in others.

477
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The so-called king

478
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is to care for the people around him.

479
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Only those who love the body

480
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
can love the children of the four sides.

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I guess he doesn't want

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
to have something to say again.

483
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
If it were you,

484
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you would keep the people around you.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You're praising me.

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Of course I can afford

487
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the best praise in the world.

488
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You're talking too much.

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I can do a lot.

490
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I think

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you're a man

492
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
who deserves my sister.

493
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
If I were a man,

494
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I wouldn't marry your sister.

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Because I'm Li.

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Right.

497
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So Li Changge's Li

498
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is Li Tang's Li.

499
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yang Cheng,

500
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
try to find out

501
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Li Jiancheng's family history.

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't think he'll be free this time.

503
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
God has been with us.

504
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He actually sent him

505
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
to me.

506
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Congratulations to the princess.

507
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Congratulations to the princess.

508
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Sheng Xin,

509
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll try to send him to the Eastern Palace.

510
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You just need to act according to the plan.

511
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
If the Yang family is restored,

512
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll send him to the Eastern Palace.

513
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll send him to the Eastern Palace.

514
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If the Yang family is restored,

515
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
you'll be the head of the palace.

516
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The crown prince will be the prime minister.

517
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Li Tang can't give you everything.

518
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I can give you everything.

519
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Thank you, princess.

520
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Go.

521
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes.

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This time,

523
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I was wrong to calculate

524
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
the thought of

525
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Xiao Kehan's encouragement

526
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to Mimi.

527
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Since this chess piece

528
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
didn't play its role,

529
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
it's possible that

530
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
it disturbed Xiao Kehan's mind.

531
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Why don't we

532
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
cut it off?

533
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
After all,

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
he was the one

535
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
who taught him well.

536
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's a pity that he's not good.

537
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Forget it.

538
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
As long as we still have the chess piece,

539
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Mimi will be

540
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
afraid of it.

541
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
As long as

542
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
we have what we want and what we fear,

543
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
we'll be dragged away

544
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
if we're weak.

545
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Li Changge is like this.

546
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Ashile Sun is like this.

547
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's a pity that

548
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Sher is like this, too.

549
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Princess,

550
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it's time for Xiao Kehan

551
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
to understand the truth.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Since Sher is free,

553
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
he should come to greet you.

554
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Khatun,

555
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Xiao Kehan wants to see you.

556
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's true that the mother and son are in contact.

557
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'll leave first.

558
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I've caused Anna trouble.

559
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Please do it.

560
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Sit down.

561
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We finally get together.

562
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
How can I bear to

563
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
watch you being locked up

564
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and never tell me

565
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that you're in trouble?

566
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I know.

567
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm sorry for being so rude.

568
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It must be because of Anna's hard work.

569
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's nothing.

570
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Here,

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
try your favorite cake.

572
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's delicious.

573
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's delicious.

574
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Anna,

575
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
do you know who poisoned you?

576
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Is it important?

577
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If the truth is not important,

578
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
what is important?

579
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Is it just a side effect?

580
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I shouldn't have asked.

582
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
No,

583
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it's not that you shouldn't have asked.

584
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But you should have understood.

585
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Since you and Shuhan

586
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
separated us,

587
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
you've been growing wild outside.

588
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You have your own way of doing things.

589
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't blame you.

590
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's just that the world

591
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
is too cold and people are too mischievous.

592
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I don't have the opportunity

593
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
to teach you well.

594
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's why you're getting further away from me.

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Anna,

596
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I just want to protect you

597
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and do my best.

598
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I also want to do what I want to do.

599
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's why I'm being rude.

600
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You've grown up.

601
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Anna is old.

602
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Sometimes,

603
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
you're not strong enough.

604
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You don't understand.

605
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But I hope you can understand one thing.

606
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That is, no matter what I do,

607
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
it's for you, my child.

608
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sorry.

609
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Boshan.

610
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Boshan.

611
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Boshan.

612
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You're awake.

613
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What are you doing?

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'll play with you when I fall asleep.

615
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Boshan.

616
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You're Boshan.

617
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You know me?

618
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm your sister's friend.

619
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You're my sister's friend.

620
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Commander Lei.

621
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Get up.

622
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Take good care of His Highness.

623
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
He'll be fine.

624
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Buzhen.

625
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm leaving.

626
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Don't tell anyone.

627
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Look after me.

628
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Is my sister all right?

629
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
She's fine.

630
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Boshan.

631
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You...

632
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You lied to His Highness

633
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and sneaked into Dingxiang.

634
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll see how Ashile Sun can save you this time.

635
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Changge.

636
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What are you doing?

637
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Why are you so careless?

638
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You can't embroider it.

639
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Leyan's wedding is about to be fixed.

640
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I can't show up in front of the officials

641
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
as the Princess of Mobei.

642
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Since I can't attend his wedding,

643
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I have to embroider a better veil for him.

644
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But look.

645
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's too ugly.

646
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Why are you laughing?

647
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's pretty.

648
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think it's very pretty.

649
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I have to find the best embroidered pattern in Chang'an.

650
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't believe I can't embroider something pretty.

651
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
When can I be good enough for you?

652
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Who said I was going to marry you?

653
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
In Tang,

654
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
parents should be polite.

655
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But my parents are long gone.

656
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I wonder if my parents will like you.

657
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
They will.

658
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
All parents in the world

659
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
will accept their daughter's husband.

660
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I swear to God,

661
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I will be good to you forever.

662
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Forever.

663
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Stop it.

664
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's not that I don't believe you.

665
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I just feel a little sorry.

666
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
My mother can't see you.

667
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm going to the embroidery workshop

668
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
to find the best embroidered pattern that I can get from my mother.

669
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I will go to propose to your mother.

670
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The scenery in the garden is so beautiful.

671
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I have to go there again.

672
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I haven't been back to the palace these days.

673
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Will my father be angry?

674
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Don't worry.

675
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I will report to His Majesty on time every day.

676
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Really?

677
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
When?

678
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
How come I don't know?

679
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm going to the garden.

680
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll go with you.

681
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'll go with you.

682
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll go with you.

683
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'll go with you.

684
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Then tell me,

685
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
if you will

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
listen to me

687
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
or to Father,

688
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I...

689
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Tang Yuan.

690
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Tang Yuan.

691
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Look, there are candies for sale here.

692
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I remember that I ate candies last time

693
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
in Luoyang.

694
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Do you remember?

695
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I remember.

696
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The last time you gave me that candy,

697
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I kept it in the room.

698
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You still keep it.

699
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Stop.

700
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Wait for me.

701
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll go buy it for you.

702
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How much is this?

703
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Two coins each.

704
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Thank you.

705
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Liu Yan.

706
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Liu Yan.

707
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Liu Yan.

708
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I thought I lost you again.

709
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
How come?

710
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I knew you would find me.

711
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Why are you sitting here?

712
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I accidentally twisted my ankle.

713
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You twisted your ankle?

714
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Wait.

715
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I saw a sword

716
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
for sale just now.

717
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I think this sword

718
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
suits your temperament.

719
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Do you like it?

720
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I like it.

721
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I like it.

722
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I like it.

723
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I like it.

724
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I like it.

725
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I...

726
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I like it.

727
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Liu Yan.

728
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
From now on,

729
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I won't let you leave me.

730
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm not worried at all.

731
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Because you're here.

732
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Are you okay?

733
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Come on.

734
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Liu Yan.

735
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Madam.

736
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm Ashile Sun.

737
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
We met last time.

738
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm here today

739
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
to propose to you.

740
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I hope you can agree

741
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
to marry Changge.

742
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
There are three reasons for me to marry Changge.

743
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
First,

744
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
since you separated from Changge,

745
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
no one cares about her anymore.

746
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
If no one cares about her,

747
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
although she's free-minded,

748
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
she'll probably come back.

749
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I want to be Changge's care.

750
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I want to be with Changge for the rest of my life.

751
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Second,

752
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I've been practicing martial arts since I was a child.

753
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think I've made a great achievement.

754
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Although I'm no longer a special guest,

755
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm confident

756
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
to protect Changge.

757
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I won't let her suffer from hunger and suffer from cold.

758
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I won't let anyone

759
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
hurt her.

760
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
No matter how hurt she is,

761
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Changge is more important than her life.

762
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Third,

763
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
what do people pursue in their life?

764
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm afraid that they're ill-intentioned,

765
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
go through ups and downs,

766
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and suffer for nothing.

767
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But in the end,

768
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
what they want

769
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
is only a peace.

770
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
This is Changge's wish.

771
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think

772
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
it's your wish too.

773
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
After this alliance,

774
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I want to take Changge back

775
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and stay away from the dispute

776
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and live a life of peace.

777
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I can't get any good dowry now.

778
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But please rest assured, Madam.

779
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I swear to God,

780
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
whether it's money or goodwill,

781
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'll do my best

782
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
to take Changge back.

783
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'll do my best.

784
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Come on.

785
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Come on.

786
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Tang Yuan.

787
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm selling the sugar man.

788
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I finally found you.

789
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Who are you?

790
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm the Crown Prince's son, Sheng Xin.

791
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
His Highness said he wanted to see Tang Jian

792
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
by asking me to pass a message.

793
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Don't be nervous, Princess.

794
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
His Highness told me about such a private matter.

795
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
He trusts me enough.

796
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I dare not say anything more.

797
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Otherwise, Princess and His Highness

798
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
can take my head at any time.

799
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Long story short,

800
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
His Highness can't tell the difference between you and me.

801
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
He just asked me to find you immediately

802
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and said he found something important.

803
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He wanted to give it to Tang Jian in person.

804
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm afraid I can't get the message from her.

805
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
His Highness is in a difficult situation.

806
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I still want to tell him

807
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
that if he wants to find Tang Jian,

808
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
she will believe me.

809
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
If you have doubts,

810
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
you can take someone you trust

811
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and go with me.

812
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's not right.

813
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
His Highness said

814
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
you can't trust me.

815
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's not right.

816
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
His Highness said it's urgent.

817
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Please go to the infirmary immediately.

818
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Your Highness.

819
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm sorry.

820
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry.

821
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm sorry.

822
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry.

823
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000

I'm sorry.

831
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm sorry.

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm sorry.

834
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000

I'm sorry.

837
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
