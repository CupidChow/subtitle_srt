1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the hardships

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will be the hope in the dark night

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will be the light in the dark night

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Keep an eye on them. Report to me if you have any questions.

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Who are you?

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who are those people?

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How dare you!

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are not allowed to enter the Purple Palace.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Aren't they the ones?

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are looking for death.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Tell me who you are.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are you acting like a guard in the Purple Palace?

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Luo Yao actually has so many personal matters.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Since you are not afraid of death,

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
who are you trying to seduce?

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Since you dare to take the poison,

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
it means that you know that

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
if you fall into our hands,

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you will definitely die.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's better to think it through

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and explain it to me.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The fire has been put out.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It seems that we are no longer needed here.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Take this guy away first.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As for your old friend,

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
it's not appropriate to go to him now.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Madam, something bad has happened.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Something bad has happened.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Madam.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Madam, something bad has happened.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I just heard from Xia Er

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that something bad has happened in the Purple Palace.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I heard that someone saw the owner of the house.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What happened in the Purple Palace?

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I heard that it was a sudden fire.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Madam, I'm leaving.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Princess, Father,

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I found traces of the fire oil

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
outside the Purple Palace.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm afraid someone is trying to set fire.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Who is trying to harm my father?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Who is the last person

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
who has seen the Crown Prince?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You just have to be honest.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The last person you see

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
when you see the Crown Prince

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is the one who can explain it clearly

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and make the whole thing clear.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Princess, Minister,

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
although I haven't seen the Crown Prince,

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I saw a group of people dressed as refugees

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
break into the Palace of the Crown Prince's bedchamber.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are assassins who broke into the Purple Palace.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can you see their faces clearly?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Minister,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
there was a lot of smoke all over the place.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I stood far away

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and didn't see them clearly.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Minister,

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I saw a woman dressed as a nun

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
who ran out of the Crown Prince's bedchamber.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I saw her and remembered her.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Could it be the accomplice of the assassins?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What does that woman look like?

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can you see her clearly?

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She looks like a nun

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
with a mole on her eye.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Could it be her?

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I really saw a ghost.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Minister.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Minister, listen to me.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Minister.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yifu.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yifu.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you waiting for?

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Get the car to the Cloud Temple.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I haven't found my brother yet.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Brother Chang, please be safe.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll inform Changge.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If Hao Du is found,

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you...

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Brother Shuyu,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn't mean that.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I mean

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
if Hao Du and Duorou Hui are found,

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can still hold them back.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You stay here.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If there is a conflict between Changge and the Cloud Temple,

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you can still get rid of the suspicion

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and continue to take over.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll prepare the silver and the token.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Be careful.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Help!

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Anli!

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please help!

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Help!

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Help!

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Be careful.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Be careful.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Help!

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Take Minister Du inside.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Zhezhen Sun is inside.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Get them back.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Go.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sirs.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you're here to see a doctor,

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you must have gone to the wrong place.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've heard that the Cloud Temple is good for the people.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's good for traveling.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm here today.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I have to walk around.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can also show my respect to you later.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But we

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
are just kind-hearted people.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
These little things

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
are nothing.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What?

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're not only kind-hearted,

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but also want to walk around.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you want to

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
compete with me?

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have something important to do.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please make yourself at home.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I have to make myself at home.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's convenient for me to be with someone.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's convenient for me to be with you.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's late at night.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want to fight with you.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Please step aside.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've given way.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Whether I can make it or not

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
depends on whether you have the ability.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What?

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't want to walk around?

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What are you going to do?

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're blocking me.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have to be more honest.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you think

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm going to enter the Cloud Temple

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
or you're going to control me?

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Where did I get this little disciple?

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Someone is looking for me in the martial arts world.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
People from the court are also watching.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're amazing.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Your Highness.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Your Highness.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why are you here alone?

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm worried about the safety of Duke Du.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I came to visit you.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But I don't know what happened.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm lost.

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
How is Duke Du now?

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Take me to see.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Did you see

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
anyone suspicious?

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm alone.

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hao Du.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's so late now.

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm still a little scared.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How about we go back first?

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll send you back to the Cloud Temple first.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Highness, please.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Your Highness.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yi Feng.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Duke Du.

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't disturb.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Go.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You two

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
go around and search for it.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If there's anyone suspicious.

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Changge.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Leng Yan.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why are you here?

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Changge.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I found you appeared in Ziwei Palace.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I suspect you're involved in this.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But he's suddenly ill

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and sent to the Cloud Temple.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm afraid you'll meet him and come to you.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You should go now.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If I go now,

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I can't wash it clean.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Where's the Crown Prince?

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I still don't know where he is.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But you can't get in trouble again.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Changge.

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Keep the Green Mountain.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm not afraid that I can't wash it clean in the future.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a misunderstanding.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Someone is chasing you.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's Hao Du.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll help you hold him.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You should go now.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What about you?

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Minister Du doesn't dare to take me.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You believe me?

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Then you be careful.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Go.

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Go.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Tu'er.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I've helped you

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
with many troubles.

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But they're from the court.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't want to bother them.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So I can only stay here.

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But except for the Cloud Temple,

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have no reason to stop them.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thanks.

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Who are you?

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why did you...

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Did Du Ruhui leave?

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think so.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But I heard

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that the young man was caught by you

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and he was angry and vomited three times.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He was so anxious.

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He almost didn't marry you.

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tu'er.

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What if those officers and soldiers

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
come again?

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They won't expect that I dare to come back.

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Tu'er is interesting.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You've been working hard.

242
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm not as hard as you.

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Watch your step.

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Be careful.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come on, sit down.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Did you explain to him?

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I did.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's a guard.

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He was washing himself

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
while he was cleaning the house

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and mixing with the water.

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He was a good man.

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He was a good man.

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He was a good man.

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He was a good man.

256
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He was washing himself

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and mixing with the water.

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Who sent them

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to kidnap the Crown Prince?

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He's a concubine.

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He doesn't even know

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
who he is.

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But he must have something to do

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with the concubines.

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The concubines?

266
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You mean

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the people of Dingxiang?

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Madam.

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Dingxiang.

270
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Madam is Madam.

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I admire you.

272
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Where is Zi Yuan?

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Take me to see him.

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Mr. Qin.

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
My wife's factory

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is not good.

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You've been working all night.

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why don't you have breakfast together?

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
All right.

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Father.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Sun Chen said

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
this medicine should be taken on time.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Father.

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Father.

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Are you still thinking about Li Changge?

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Li Changge is still alive.

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I saw her with my own eyes.

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
She's still in Liuyun Temple.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If the temple owner

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and Sun Zhenren

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
are determined to repay her,

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
we can't rely on them.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I just don't know

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
if the Crown Prince

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
is in Li Changge's hands.

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What if...

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In my opinion,

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
if the Crown Prince is really in Li Changge's hands,

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the Crown Prince's safety will not be a problem.

301
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Even after going through so many things,

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Li Changge and Princess Li have a deep relationship.

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
She will not really be kind to the Crown Prince.

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let the Princess experience the same pain as her.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's right.

306
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But we can't let Li Changge

307
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
use our first army as a means.

308
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The news of the Crown Prince's disappearance

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
can't be kept for too long.

310
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We must catch Li Changge as soon as possible

311
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and get the Crown Prince back.

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Li Changge is a tough one

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
to catch in Luoyang Fishing Village.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What's more...

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What's more,

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Princess Yong'an will be the bait

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and cover up for her.

318
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Right?

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Princess Yong'an.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Princess.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Now that the Crown Prince is missing,

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Luoyang Fishing Village will be in chaos soon.

323
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please don't let your uncle

324
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
make any mistakes

325
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
in case you have to go back to the same day.

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't worry.

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Now that my brother is missing,

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I won't cause you any trouble.

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Now the rumors are all false.

330
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No one knows what will happen next.

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm going to dispatch troops now.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't keep an eye on the Princess.

333
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Please don't cause yourself any trouble.

334
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Didn't all the servants send out to patrol?

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Why do you still need to dispatch troops?

336
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Are you searching for someone

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
or are you going to catch someone?

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hao Du.

339
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The most important thing now is to find my brother.

340
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
As for catching someone,

341
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think we can let him go.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
How do you know that the Crown Prince is missing

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
has nothing to do with others?

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Now the Luoyang Fishing Village

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
must be done by someone.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Whoever makes the biggest profit

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
must be the one who wants to disturb the people's hearts.

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay.

349
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Then let's open the window and talk.

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you suspecting?

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Li Changge is in Luoyang.

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

353
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Princess Xie didn't lie to me.

354
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I saw her with my own eyes.

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But I can testify for Changge.

356
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This matter has nothing to do with her.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because I...

358
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't care what she said

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
or did in front of you.

360
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This may be part of her plan.

361
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So please

362
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
stay in the mansion.

363
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't mess up.

364
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Mr. Xiang,

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
what are you thinking about?

367
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I've been lost for a long time.

368
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's your turn.

369
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I thought you got news from the maid

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and wanted to take me to investigate the fire in Ziwei Palace.

371
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What are you thinking about?

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't even know where you came from.

373
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
How can I take you to investigate serious things?

374
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then why do you still take me

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
to play chess in such a place?

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What's wrong with this place?

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's too hot.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The game of chess

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
is about calmness and calmness.

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You have to be fully focused.

381
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Only in a lively place

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
can you get your mind straight.

383
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I have something to do.

384
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Goodbye.

385
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You've been back home with me.

386
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You just left like that.

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not appropriate.

388
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Besides,

389
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you followed me

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
just to know

391
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
what the nobles in Ziwei Palace

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
have to do with me.

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't you still need to find your old friend?

394
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Come back.

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Next time,

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Gu Renyu

397
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
is like a man who is used to playing chess.

398
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
After you and I play chess,

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I can get a good feel for you.

400
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe then

401
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I can take you to do serious things.

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't know how to play chess.

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The old tricks in your hands

404
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
are not something

405
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
you can get from fighting for years.

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's like using troops to play chess.

407
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I've told you the rules.

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Since you know how to fight,

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you must know how to play chess.

410
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Come on.

411
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's not enough.

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's start over.

413
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
All right.

414
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Your Highness,

415
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm still scared.

416
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Don't be scared.

417
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Just do as I said.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They won't do anything.

419
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If they break in,

420
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you can teach them a lesson.

421
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Just say,

422
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
this person is too worried

423
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and caught a cold.

424
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He's sweating.

425
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He's only wearing a formal dress.

426
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They won't do anything.

427
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But you must remember

428
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
to cover your face.

429
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Just wait until I come back.

430
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Do you understand?

431
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Your Highness.

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Quan Niang.

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Sorry.

434
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Liuyuan Temple closed recently.

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't have any guests.

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Quan Niang.

437
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Your Highness.

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Zhao...

439
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Where's A'Li?

440
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why did you

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
call A'Li?

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I have something to do with her.

443
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Where's A'Li now?

444
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
A'Li...

445
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
She's not in the temple now.

446
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Quan Niang.

447
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If A'Li comes back,

448
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
please give her this letter.

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Tell her

450
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll wait for her until she's back.

451
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Remember.

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay.

454
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Any news?

455
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Father's prediction was right.

456
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Princess Yongan

457
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
is in the trap.

458
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Don't look at me.

459
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Go find the Crown Prince.

460
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes.

461
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The Crown Prince's Manor

462
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You're using the army.

463
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Among the leaders I've seen,

464
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
there's only one who is so well-equipped.

465
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng.

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's a pity.

467
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I heard Gongsun Heng

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
risked his life

469
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
to save the people.

470
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm willing to ask.

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's a real man's festival.

472
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But I heard that

473
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Gongsun Heng has a capable man

474
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
named Qin in his hometown.

475
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Is Mr. Qin his friend?

476
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What are you going to do

477
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
in this mud of Luoyang?

478
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You've been using Gongsun Heng's

479
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
army formation to deal with me.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But you never show

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
your familiar way of using the army.

482
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So you've already gotten used to it.

483
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You're not going to

484
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
join the army as soon as possible.

485
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I just want to see

486
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
how well you can use

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Gongsun Heng's army.

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If you use your own way of using the army,

489
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I may not be your opponent.

490
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's a pity that you're not honest enough.

491
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm Mr. Qin's nephew

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
in the military.

493
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In fact...

494
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We're partners.

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
There are two ways to the outside world.

496
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But you're afraid to show

497
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
your own way of using the army

498
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
because you're afraid of being attacked.

499
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's easy to be seen.

500
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Actually, you want to be here.

501
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But this is the way of the grassland people.

502
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No.

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm from the Central Plains.

504
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Interesting.

505
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Li,

506
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Her Highness is here.

507
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I told her you weren't here.

508
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
She left this.

509
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Thank you for thinking for me.

510
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Quanniang,

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I have to see Her Highness.

512
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

513
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll go with you.

514
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'll go with you.

515
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll go with you.

516
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Go.

517
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It doesn't matter who I am.

518
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I came to Luoyang

519
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
just to find my old friend.

520
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Then can you tell me now

521
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
if your old friend is also related to the nobility in the palace?

522
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No.

523
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It doesn't matter.

524
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm looking for him.

525
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It has nothing to do with his identity.

526
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Li seems to be

527
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
actually considering Her Highness as a side person.

528
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
He's very close to her.

529
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
If Her Highness is gone,

530
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm sure Li will find her even if he steps on the mountain river.

531
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Am I right?

532
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I thought you were a man.

533
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I didn't expect you to be a woman.

534
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I like this.

535
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay.

536
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm willing to help you find someone you like.

537
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Someone I like?

538
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Isn't it?

539
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I guess she must be a beautiful and handsome woman.

540
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yes.

541
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
See? I'm right.

542
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Do you care about her

543
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and care about her

544
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and don't want to leave her at any moment?

545
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't care.

546
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You don't care about her

547
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and don't want to leave her at any moment?

548
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You don't care about other women.

549
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
If you insist on staying with someone

550
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
every moment,

551
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and never leave her,

552
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
until you're old enough,

553
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
do you want her to be her?

554
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Even if there are many beautiful and gentle women

555
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
who look up to you,

556
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
you still want to choose this bad-tempered

557
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and arrogant little girl.

558
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Not a little girl.

559
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Is she a father?

560
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Qin Xun's hobby is really admirable.

561
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
She's a woman who's always on top.

562
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
No matter who she is,

563
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
anyway,

564
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
she's the one I like.

565
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm done.

566
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm done.

567
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The door of the garrison in my stomach

568
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
is about to be blown up by you.

569
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm done.

570
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Brother Li,

571
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you're going to be a bad-tempered woman?

572
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What bad-tempered woman?

573
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You're talking so badly.

574
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's her.

575
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Mr. Qin,

576
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you're a man

577
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
who's not innocent.

578
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You're a man

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
who's not innocent.

580
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Qin Xun,

581
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
with your unidentified identity,

582
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I think you should mind your own business.

583
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's still early.

584
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Come on, sit down.

585
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Let's play another round.

586
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Come on.

587
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Brother Li,

588
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I have something urgent.

589
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'll visit you another day.

590
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm on the way.

591
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Just go.

592
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Brother Shuyu,

593
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
have you got the things?

594
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
They're all in the bag.

595
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But Leyan,

596
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
it's so strange.

597
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
How could things go so smoothly?

598
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
With Hao Du's behavior,

599
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
he must have noticed.

600
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
How about this?

601
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Take the things to the gate and wait.

602
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll wait for Changge

603
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to inform her to meet you in the dark.

604
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But,

605
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm not going to wait.

606
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm going to wait for you.

607
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'll wait for you.

608
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'll wait for you.

609
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll wait for you.

610
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'll wait for you.

611
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll wait for you.

612
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'll wait for you.

613
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'll wait for you.

614
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'll wait for you.

615
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But...

616
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Mr. Wei,

617
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
you're too mean to me.

618
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hao Du,

619
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
why are you here?

620
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Now the Crown Prince is missing.

621
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Luoyang City is being robbed.

622
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You take the Princess out of here.

623
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
If anything happens to her...

624
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
How do you know I'm here?

625
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If you don't even know this,

626
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
how can you protect the Princess?

627
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You...

628
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You...

629
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Where did you get the token?

630
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And who did you give it to?

631
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I took the token.

632
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Are you going to catch me?

633
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm going to catch you.

634
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm going to catch you.

635
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm going to catch you.

636
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm going to catch you.

637
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm going to catch you.

638
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm going to catch you.

639
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm going to catch you.

640
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going to catch you.

641
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm going to catch you.

642
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm going to catch you.

643
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm going to catch you.

644
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm going to catch you.

645
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm going to catch you.

646
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm going to catch you.

647
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm going to catch you.

648
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm going to catch you.

649
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm going to catch you.

650
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm going to catch you.

651
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm going to catch you.

652
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm going to catch you.

653
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm going to catch you.

654
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm going to catch you.

655
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm going to catch you.

656
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm going to catch you.

657
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm going to catch you.

658
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm going to catch you.

659
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm going to catch you.

660
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm going to catch you.

661
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm going to catch you.

662
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm going to catch you.

663
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm going to catch you.

664
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm going to catch you.

665
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm going to catch you.

666
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm going to catch you.

667
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm going to catch you.

668
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm going to catch you.

669
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm going to catch you.

670
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm going to catch you.

671
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm going to catch you.

672
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm going to catch you.

673
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm going to catch you.

674
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm going to catch you.

675
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to catch you.

676
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm going to catch you.

677
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm going to catch you.

678
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm going to catch you.

679
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm going to catch you.

680
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm going to catch you.

681
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Go.

682
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, no.

683
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Go after her.

684
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Go after her.

685
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Let her go.

686
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I told you to let her go.

687
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Changge.

688
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That person is...

689
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That person...

690
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That person saved Changge in Youzhou.

691
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
He is Changge's friend.

692
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He saved Changge?

693
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes.

694
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He kidnapped me

695
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and saved Changge from Hao Du.

696
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No matter who he is,

697
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
he can save Changge in time.

698
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He is trustworthy.

699
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Before saying goodbye,

700
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm looking forward to...

701
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Changge.

702
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There is an ambush there.

703
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Your friend is kidnapped.

704
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm going to catch you here.

705
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I didn't expect you to be here.

706
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What about Leyan?

707
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
They are all people in the court.

708
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't worry. He must be safe.

709
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Leave here first.

710
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You don't hate me anymore?

711
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There is always a sense of longing

712
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
between you and me.

713
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I hate you for leaving without saying goodbye.

714
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
In different worlds.

715
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
In different worlds.

716
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I miss you forever.

717
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I promise to stay by your side.

718
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This way.

719
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Don't be a shadow.

720
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What is this place?

721
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The most famous bar in Guiyang.

722
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
They must not expect

723
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
we are hiding in the most crowded place.

724
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Come on.

725
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Why are you so familiar here?

726
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I played chess with someone here before.

727
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You played chess here?

728
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Changge.

729
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm looking for you.

730
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's so hard.

731
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You are looking for me from the grassland to here?

732
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I shouldn't blame you.

734
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I owe you too much.

735
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Then don't leave anymore.

736
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Take your time.

737
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I saved your life just now.

738
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't you want to give me a drink?

739
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm grateful for your kindness.

740
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I didn't say I would marry you.

741
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Who will suffer the loss?

742
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Not sure.

743
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Tang...Tang.

744
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I heard your voice just now.

745
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I can't believe it.

746
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's really you.

747
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Go away.

748
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Go away.

749
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Shut up.

750
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Why are you here?

751
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Do you know that it's a mess because of you?

752
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Tang.

753
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You are alive.

754
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You are alive.

755
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Congratulations.

756
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You haven't answered my question for a long time.

757
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I...

758
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I slipped out.

759
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The people below said that this bar was very fun.

760
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
There was a western dance that was close to the eyes and a piglet dance.

761
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I just want to...

762
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
want to...

763
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So you sneaked out.

764
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Not tied up.

765
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Kid.

766
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Think it over first.

767
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Have you been staying here all the time?

768
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Do you know that Ziwei Palace is on fire?

769
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I...

770
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I heard about it.

771
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You heard about it and you still didn't go out?

772
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I...

773
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
When it was on fire, I was already asleep.

774
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I only heard about it later.

775
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
If I go back now,

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Du Shao Shu will scold me to death.

777
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You little brat.

778
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Li Chang Ge.

779
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I am the crown prince now.

780
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You are annoying.

781
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Besides, I will beat you.

782
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Li Chang Ge.

783
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
If you dare to touch me again, I will cut your fingers.

784
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Sister Tao.

785
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I am your brother.

786
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just say what you want to say.

787
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I will beat you.

788
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Li Cheng Qian.

789
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You are getting older.

790
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The older you get, the more you are not getting better.

791
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It is so ridiculous to be the crown prince.

792
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I feel ashamed for Li Shi Ming.

793
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
How can he raise a son like you?

794
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You didn't even learn a little from your father and you want to be the crown prince?

795
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Why are you scolding me like this?

796
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Everyone says that I don't deserve to be the son of my father.

797
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I thought...

798
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I did such a thing to your family.

799
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
At least you think I deserve to be the son of my father.

800
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
At least I have the ability to take advantage of others.

801
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But you...

802
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Are you really going to take away the crown prince?

803
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
How dare you!

804
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I must tell Minister Du to tell you.

805
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
How dare you come back to Luoyang?

806
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Since you found out,

807
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I won't let you go.

808
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Sister Tao.

809
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We are all relatives.

810
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
We can't talk about it.

811
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You have to turn around.

812
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You can't be a bad friend.

813
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Li Cheng Ge.

814
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Don't be rude.

815
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Don't you like to play?

816
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Then I'll let you play once.

817
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Go.

818
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Masters.

819
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Please let my brother have a good time.

820
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Make sure he is as handsome as a turtle.

821
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Okay.

822
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
If there is any harm,

823
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I won't forgive you.

824
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm the crown prince.

825
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm the crown prince.

826
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You dare to offend me.

827
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You don't want to live anymore.

828
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
My brother had a fever when he was a kid.

829
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
He has a bad brain.

830
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You must not believe what he said.

831
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Sister.

832
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm sorry.

833
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Please let me go.

834
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
We are all relatives.

835
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We can talk about it.

836
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You know I'm your sister.

837
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay.

838
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Since you call me sister,

839
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'll teach you a good lesson for your father.

840
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Masters.

841
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Thank you for your help.

842
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Don't break it.

843
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Otherwise, I can't tell my mother.

844
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Don't worry.

845
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I've taught many kids.

846
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I know.

847
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Have fun.

848
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Don't go.

849
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Don't go.

850
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Sister.

851
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Sister.

852
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I've never lost since I was a kid.

853
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You're so cheap.

854
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Are you happy now?

855
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yes.

856
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Then go back with me.

857
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Where?

858
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
18th and Qin Lao are in Luoyang.

859
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They are all looking for you.

860
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
18th and Qin Lao.

861
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What about Yuan Niang?

862
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
She is also here.

863
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What about Xu Feng?

864
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They are all here.

865
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yan Xingmen?

866
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's the picture of Qin Lao and his friends.

867
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I really miss them.

868
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What's wrong?

869
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't know how to face them when I go back.

870
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Don't think too much.

871
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You'll know when you go back.

872
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Let's go.

873
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Princess.

874
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Your memories gradually come back to me.

875
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Your memories gradually come back to me.

876
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Your memories gradually come back to me.

877
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Before we say goodbye,

878
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I hope...

879
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I hope your life

880
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
can be locked into my tender dream.

881
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Before dawn,

882
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
the yearning flows through my fingers.

883
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
There's always a moment

884
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

885
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
There's always a longing

886
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
that's between you and me.

887
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's all in front of me.

888
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
In different worlds,

889
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
in different worlds,

890
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm missing you.

891
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The deep night

892
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
has become eternity.

893
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The cocoon of time.

894
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
There's always a moment

895
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

896
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
There's always a longing

897
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
that's between you and me.

898
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's all in front of me.

899
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
In different worlds,

900
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
in different worlds,

901
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm missing you.

902
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The deep night

903
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
has become eternity.

904
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The cocoon of time.

905
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The cocoon of time.

906
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The cocoon of time.
