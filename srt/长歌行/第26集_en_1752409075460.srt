1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No one can escape

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
No one can resist

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You are awake and smiling

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No one can escape

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No one can escape

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No one can escape

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No one can escape

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No one can escape

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No one can escape

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No one can escape

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No one can escape

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No one can escape

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No one can escape

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No one can escape

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No one can escape

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No one can escape

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No one can escape

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No one can escape

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No one can escape

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No one can escape

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No one can escape

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No one can escape

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No one can escape

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No one can escape

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No one can escape

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No one can escape

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No one can escape

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No one can escape

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,440
The Long Ballad

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Take good care of Eagle Division.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,800
Sun,

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
on this grassland,

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
except me,

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,880
no one is worthy of being the special agent of Eagle Division.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
No matter where I go,

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Ashile Tribe is in my heart.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,200
Please help me, Father.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,960
Sun,

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
do you know that

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
I have been training you since childhood

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,880
and have given you great hope?

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,480
Why do you want to

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
retreat now?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
I have always thought that

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,320
as long as I become strong enough,

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
I can protect everyone.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,440
But now I can't even protect my mother.

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,600
Maybe I can't be the hero on this grassland.

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Please let your son leave.

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
I don't want to compete anymore.

52
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,040
Why do you want to slander yourself so much?

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
I have tried my best.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
If this had happened earlier,

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
I shouldn't have been strong.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
Let your son leave.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
I will promise you.

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,040
But you must remember that

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,680
no matter where you go,

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520
I will be sincere

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,760
to Sun.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
I will never forget you.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
I will never forget you.

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,200
Sun,

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,600
I just hope that I won't get you into trouble again after I leave.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,080
And don't suffer for my situation anymore.

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,400
Here.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Everyone has his own difficulties.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
If he doesn't want to talk, why bother asking?

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
You're right.

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,320
But, old man,

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
let's go to the next town

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
and change a horse, okay?

75
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Look at our donkey.

76
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
It's almost a horse.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
How can it move us?

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
It's so slow.

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
When will it go?

80
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
I said the donkey is good.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
You young people have a lot of time.

82
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,400
Why are you in such a hurry?

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Have some tea.

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Okay.

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Do you know

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
what will happen to A'Yi

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
if you force A'Yi to die?

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I know I was wrong.

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Please punish me.

90
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,000
Punish you?

91
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
I punished you.

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Can A'Yi survive?

93
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Do you know

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,400
A'Yi is Sun's only partner?

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Sun is the most capable.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
Not only he can lead the army to fight,

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
but more importantly,

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
he can win the hearts of all Eagle Division.

99
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
But from today,

100
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't control

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,600
the internal chaos

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
of Eagle Division and Ashile Tribe.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
And I lost Eagle Division.

104
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a must.

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
When will I

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
regain my strength?

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's hard to fight here.

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Useless.

109
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
You're all useless.

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
His illness

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
is not from the skin.

112
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
But from the heart.

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
He is full of

114
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,200
anger,

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,000
and he is angry.

116
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,200
He doesn't want to live.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Even the gods can't save him.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why are you looking at me?

119
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm only responsible for saving people.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
I can't see you treating him.

121
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Nonsense.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
You must save people.

123
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
You must save people to be alive.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's saving people.

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
If you don't save people,

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,200
why do you save people?

127
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I only care about saving people.

128
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
I don't care about treating people.

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
You must make him

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
move quickly.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Move quickly?

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
Move quickly?

133
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
Since you don't want to report,

134
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I'll leave now.

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
No.

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,600
You can't leave.

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Go and get that little bastard back.

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
It's hard to see him.

139
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Not bad.

140
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
A good woman is a good woman.

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
A tiger is a tiger.

142
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
A good man is a good man.

143
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
What are you doing?

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Since you don't want to live,

145
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll kill you.

146
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Why do you save me?

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Oh, right.

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Why should I save you?

149
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I should kill you.

150
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
You...

151
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Master.

152
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
He's moving.

153
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
But he vomited.

154
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Is he okay?

155
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
Your move to save people

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,400
is a good woman's way to save people.

157
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
You're a good man.

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Since it's effective,

159
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
I have something to do.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

161
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Master.

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I

163
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
may become a master.

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:08:08,480
The famous Eagle Division's special

165
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
qin is retreating.

166
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
Didn't you say I'm a coward?

167
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
I think you're very suitable for this title.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
This is the best chance for you to kill me.

169
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Why did you help me?

170
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Believe it or not,

171
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I never really want you to die.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I do see you as my biggest rival.

173
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
But we were brothers, right?

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
I didn't hate you from the beginning.

175
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,000
I've been working hard since I was a kid.

176
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
I tried my best to fight for Shu Han.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I tried to get the achievement

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
and win the approval of the grasslands.

179
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,400
But no matter how hard I tried,

180
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
no matter how well I did,

181
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
no matter how well I did,

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
there was always someone who was in front of me.

183
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
There was always someone who surpassed me.

184
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
More and more people were so stubborn to me.

185
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
They said I was inferior to you.

186
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
It's like

187
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
all my efforts were a joke.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
So the more they supported you,

189
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
the more I hated you.

190
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
I couldn't help but compete with you.

191
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
But after so many things, I found

192
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
I didn't really hate you.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
I hate myself for not being as good as you.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's my obsession that has caused the situation.

195
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
I admit my mistakes.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Is this the reason you saved me?

197
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
If I really lost you,

198
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
my future life would be boring.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Don't think I'll thank you.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
I'll never forget

201
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
how Anna died.

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Then stay and take revenge on me.

203
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,400
I said it before.

204
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
If I had to take revenge, you would have died long ago.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
Did you leave Eagle Division because of Li Changge?

206
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
Can't the whole Eagle Division

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
be compared to Li Changge?

208
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
As long as I'm still the Eagle Division's special agent,

209
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
I'll be responsible for Eagle Division.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But Li Changge,

211
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
as Ashile Sun,

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
I have to protect her with my life.

213
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
When I settle down Eagle Division,

214
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
even if I have to go to the end of the world,

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
I'll find her again.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
I seem to know why I always lose you.

217
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Do you think I'm so hard to accept?

218
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,600
How can you others not know that?

219
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,600
Shuiyuan!

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Where is Li Changge?

221
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Tell me where she is.

222
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
world

223
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Tell me where she is.

224
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,260
World

225
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,800
Please tell me where she is.

226
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,000
Please stand up.

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,400
Please tell me where she is.

228
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,000
World

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please tell me where she is.

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not going to tell him.

231
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
I know what kind of person you are.

232
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
If you have any grudges, just come at me.

233
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
Changge is innocent.

234
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,280
He was finally rescued by a man in the South

235
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
dressed as a Central Plain.

236
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,520
As for his life, I don't know.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You didn't lie to me.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't lie to you.

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I didn't lie to you.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't lie to you.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will never lie to you.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is what he left behind when he was rescued.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I returned it to you.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is Changge's grave.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Send Su Yishe to search the South.

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you meet a Central Plain person, stop the interrogation.

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Go.

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Changge, wait for me.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Khatun,

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Aunt A'Yi's remains have been packed.

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know how to deal with it.

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Burn it.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Khatun,

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
are you missing the Central Plain?

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I miss the Central Plain.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I miss you.

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I miss you.

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Where is the Central Plain?

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Spring is flowing.

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The night is full of fireflies.

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Autumn is full of red leaves.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The winter is full of snow.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The palace lights are flickering.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The Central Plain in my memory is always clear.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But if it's in Jiangnan,

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
even if it's cold winter and hot moon,

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
there are endless

270
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
cangtai and bishu,

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
jade and qunshan.

272
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You are a good father who never forgets his own son.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's why you have a son who always ruins my big plan.

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's why you have a son who always ruins my big plan.

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Your son is so stupid that he killed A'Yi.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now,

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sun has no family.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He doesn't want anything.

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He even wants to leave me.

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I put A'Yi under your account.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why don't you take good care of her?

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If it's like this,

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you and your mother are totally inescapable.

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Khan, please calm down.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Khan,

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I...

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I can't die.

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But Sher,

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Sher is loyal to Khan and the grasslands.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Maybe he has a lot of shortcomings now.

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But if he grows up,

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
he will take the responsibility of protecting the grasslands.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Please give him another chance.

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Give him another chance?

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't think that Sun is not here.

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will give everything to your useless son.

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A useless person

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
doesn't deserve to be the king of the grasslands.

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The glory of the Han Wei

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
belongs to the strong forever.

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If you have this bitter face,

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I hate to see you like this in my life.

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
From today,

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
you are grounded for a month.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You and your useless son

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
will reflect on yourself.

307
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I remember.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
From now on,

309
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
don't let me see these things again.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The King of the Grasslands

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Sir, I have news.

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There is indeed someone from the Central Plains

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
who appeared on the border of the grasslands.

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The guards once carried a donkey cart.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There are one old man and two young men.

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And a young lady.

317
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The old man claimed that they were from the south.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It must be Changge.

319
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Su Yishe,

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
go and investigate again.

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
See if there is any more specific news.

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's great.

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Mu Jin,

325
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
if you are in the Eagle Division,

326
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
just like usual,

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
if you have any news,

328
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
contact me immediately.

329
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Sun,

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to go too.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I want to go with Mimi.

332
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
One more person, one more strength.

333
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can only do this alone.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The disaster that Changge caused on the grasslands

336
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
has just been calmed.

337
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If Father Han finds out about our whereabouts,

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it will be a big trouble.

339
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You and Mimi

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
can stay in Eagle Division.

341
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Sun,

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
what about your injury?

343
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I know best

344
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
how my injury is.

345
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Mu Jin,

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can only rely on you

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
on the Eagle Division.

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Fine.

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't help you anyway.

350
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I owe you in my previous life.

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Find someone to take care of yourself.

352
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
By the way,

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
where is Luo Shiba that Changge brought back?

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Since you came back from the Royal Court,

355
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
he left.

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He insisted that Changge was not dead.

357
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He said he would find her.

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He was right.

359
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's good.

360
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
One more person to worry about

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
will give me more hope.

362
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Sun,

363
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
do you really

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
like Changge?

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

366
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If you don't want to say it,

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
forget it.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I said

370
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
yes.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I like her.

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did you tell her

373
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that she knows your feelings?

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you need to tell her

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
that you like someone?

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Don't I need to?

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't know what to do.

378
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
she will understand.

380
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Your skin is good.

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Give me another one.

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay.

383
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Have you seen her?

384
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No.

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I haven't.

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Have you seen this person?

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You are so good at fighting.

388
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Have you seen her?

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You haven't seen her.

390
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Have you seen this person?

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No.

392
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Have you seen this person?

393
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Have you seen her?

395
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No.

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Here.

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Miss, are you looking for someone?

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Let me have a look.

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Have you seen her?

400
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is this person

401
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
a man or a woman?

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
A woman.

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Can't you tell?

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can tell.

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You draw it so well.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This person looks familiar.

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Do you want to tell me

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
how old is she?

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't know.

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
She is about my age.

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
She is about my age.

412
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You are not familiar with her?

413
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Then why are you looking for her?

414
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Does she owe you money?

415
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No.

416
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Then you are close?

417
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
No.

418
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then you should know

419
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
what her name is.

420
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Otherwise, I can't tell you.

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Her name is Li Changge.

422
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wait. I have seen this person.

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Where is she?

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Come with me.

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Where is she?

426
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
She is in front of us.

427
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We are almost there.

428
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Keep walking.

429
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Go a little further.

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
After you pass that door,

431
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you will be there.

432
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Tell me the truth.

433
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you a man or a woman?

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I am a man.

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I am a man.

436
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I am a man.

437
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I am a man.

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Tell me the truth.

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who sent you to find Li Changge?

440
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Did Chang'an send you?

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Liar.

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
My lady.

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No. No. No.

444
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't be agitated.

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a misunderstanding.

446
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Did you hurt her?

447
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No. No.

448
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We are friends.

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
How could I hurt her?

450
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Friends?

451
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes. Yes.

452
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The kind of people who fight.

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What is a friend?

454
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's it.

455
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Later, I didn't know.

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I didn't expect

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you have been through such a hard time.

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You are so hard-hearted.

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You fell into Ashile Tribe's hands

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and made them go through hell.

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Not necessarily.

462
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What do you mean?

463
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't know if I am alive

464
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
or dead.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't worry, my lady.

466
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
People of Yan Xingmen

467
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
have been looking for her.

468
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I think there must be a way.

469
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yan Xingmen?

470
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We were the previous governor of Shuozhou,

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Gongsun Heng's subordinates.

472
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Now,

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
we are with your master.

474
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Now,

475
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
we are called Yan Xingmen.

476
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
In the name of the business team,

477
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
we are the Yan Xingmen.

478
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You should believe us.

479
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There are many people.

480
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It must be easier to find humans.

481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
With this portrait,

482
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm afraid it's hard to find her.

483
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Why?

484
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Anyway,

485
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
we will find her

486
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
with Lady Luo.

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think

488
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
we should find her together.

489
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Lady Luo is our accomplice.

490
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We should communicate

491
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
with each other

492
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
so that we can find her together.

493
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Whoever gets the message first

494
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
should contact each other

495
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
through this paper.

496
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I understand.

497
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Put this on.

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Lady Luo,

499
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think your business is in danger.

500
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Do you want to follow me?

501
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Situ Langlang,

504
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
is that enough?

505
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
No, it's not.

506
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's still far from enough.

507
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Mr. Sun is my creditor.

508
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
He asked me to treat your wound

509
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
with acupuncture every day.

510
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I had to do that.

511
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Treat wound?

512
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You treat wound with acupuncture?

513
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Be careful.

514
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's not good to be cut.

515
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Situ,

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
your apprentice is good.

517
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Stop.

518
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What...

519
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What apprentice?

520
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You

521
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
bullied a guard

522
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
with a long weapon.

523
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What kind of a player are you?

524
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I bullied you?

525
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Since we have to fight every day,

526
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
why don't you

527
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
exchange it with me?

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Why not?

529
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Come, come.

530
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Ronghao.

531
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What should I do?

532
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Again.

533
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,760
You're so good!

534
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,440
How is it?

535
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,800
Am I great?

536
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,800
Little girl,

537
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
do you want to be my disciple?

538
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,760
You and I are the same age.

539
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,440
I don't want to be your servant.

540
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,880
Don't!

541
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
I finally got a disciple.

542
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Do you want to reconsider?

543
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,520
I've got a reputation

544
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,560
in the sword industry.

545
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,960
If you know how to use swordsmanship,

546
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,360
can you be able to do everything

547
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,440
to kill the enemy's enemy in thousands of soldiers?

548
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,320
No problem.

549
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,200
It's too simple.

550
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,520
If you're really that good at swordsmanship,

551
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,240
and you can help me succeed in the war,

552
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm willing to be your disciple.

553
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,000
Forget it.

554
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,760
Let's just forget it.

555
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,560
I'm not good at it.

556
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Wait.

557
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,840
You haven't taught me yet.

558
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,800
How do you know I can't learn it?

559
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
I've already heard

560
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,360
what you said just now.

561
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,320
It's different.

562
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
You can't learn the art of music.

563
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,040
Don't waste your time.

564
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,600
I don't believe you.

565
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,800
You're quite stubborn.

566
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,840
Seriously.

567
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,200
Fine. I'll teach you.

568
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,320
But I'm telling you.

569
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,000
You definitely can't learn it.

570
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
I'm Li Changge.

571
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,480
Thank you for your advice.

572
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,440
All right.

573
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,640
My wife's illness has just got better.

574
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't tire her out.

575
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,760
Sir.

576
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,520
I'm just a regular person.

577
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,960
Why don't you care about me?

578
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Little girl.

579
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,880
A disciple of the Imperial Guards

580
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,560
wants to invite me to the interrogation.

581
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,560
Do you want to go to Luoyang with us?

582
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,960
Luoyang?

583
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,680
I told you to leave first.

584
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,320
If it weren't for taking care of me,

585
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,240
you would have been in Luoyang long ago.

586
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,160
If it weren't for you,

587
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,360
I would have been in a mess.

588
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,240
Don't say such sad words.

589
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,440
We're almost in Luoyang.

590
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,720
I'll find you a good place

591
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,080
as soon as we arrive in Luoyang.

592
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,120
You're just bragging.

593
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,800
Listen.

594
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,240
Luoyang's medical department...

595
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,760
Xiaowu.

596
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,720
Here.

597
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,560
I'll carry you.

598
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,720
Come on.

599
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,240
No.

600
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm a man of great power.

601
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,000
How can I need a lady to carry me?

602
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,640
I'll carry you.

603
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,480
Do you want me?

604
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,000
Come on.

605
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,280
Help!

606
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,640
No.

607
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,600
Help!

608
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,320
Help!

609
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Help!

610
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,480
Stop fighting.

611
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Stop fighting.

612
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,640
You...

613
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,080
You're refugees from the south, right?

614
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,080
Don't be afraid.

615
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,520
It's not a good thing.

616
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,840
It's just a dog coffin at the gate.

617
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,760
We'll be lucky if we meet you.

618
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,920
Let's go.

619
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,560
Brothers.

620
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,400
Go and get some food.

621
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,040
Go.

622
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,040
Let's go.

623
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,320
Let's follow them.

624
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,040
We have food, brothers.

625
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,840
Food!

626
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Food!

627
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
Food!

628
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Food!

629
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,560
Food!

630
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
I want food, too.

631
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,360
I want food, too.

632
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,520
Brothers.

633
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,480
Look at this dog coffin.

634
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,080
It's carrying food

635
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,360
but it doesn't give us food.

636
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,520
What kind of logic is this?

637
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,440
Since they want to starve us to death,

638
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,480
we can grab some food.

639
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,320
What's wrong with that?

640
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,080
Yes.

641
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,880
Yes.

642
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Yes.

643
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,920
Do you know

644
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
why they don't give us food?

645
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Why?

646
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,400
Why?

647
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
The current law and order is the right way.

648
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,160
The people have no way out.

649
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,640
Now the god has brought disaster

650
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,200
and made us innocent.

651
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
The nobles of Luoyang City

652
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,560
feed dogs with meat

653
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,400
but they don't give us food.

654
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,760
So even if we kill

655
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,320
these people,

656
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,400
we'll die for nothing.

657
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Yes.

658
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
You're wrong.

659
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,120
What's wrong with me?

660
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,880
We don't have food.

661
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,920
It's because of the natural disaster.

662
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,680
We've been walking in the desert

663
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,720
and we can't get food.

664
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,840
The natural disaster is natural disaster.

665
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,880
The people are the people.

666
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,000
Now you've robbed this cart of food.

667
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,400
The people who save lives

668
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
from this cart of food will starve to death.

669
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,240
If we don't rob them,

670
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,200
we'll starve to death today.

671
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Yes.

672
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,440
We'll starve to death.

673
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,160
Yes.

674
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,920
It's us.

675
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,840
We shouldn't kill these officials.

676
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,640
They just take a little money.

677
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,520
They transport food

678
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,720
to feed their families.

679
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,240
They're friends,

680
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,400
family, and brothers.

681
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,160
Some people are waiting for them to go back.

682
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Well...

683
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
You're so mean.

684
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,920
You're still

685
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,400
helping the government.

686
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,920
If you don't eat,

687
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,440
then don't eat.

688
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,440
Get out.

689
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,160
Get out.

690
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,760
Get out.

691
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Get out.

692
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,400
Get out.

693
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,920
Get out.

694
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,400
Get out.

695
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,920
Get out.

696
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Get out.

697
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,760
Get out.

698
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,440
Get out.

699
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,040
Get out.

700
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Mr. Zhang,

701
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,040
have you seen him?

702
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,800
What's wrong with him recently?

703
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,040
He was

704
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
looking for someone with a portrait.

705
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,360
What a coincidence!

706
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,200
You're looking for the same person.

707
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,480
Where did he go?

708
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Who are you?

709
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Long time no see.

710
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
It's you.

711
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,560
Cut the bomb out that would have killed me.

712
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,240
Cut the bomb out.

713
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,280
For what you've done,

714
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,560
just do that.

715
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,640
I'll find you.

716
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,240
You've worked hard on this journey.

717
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
You didn't even drink a sip of water.

718
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,160
Hang in there.

719
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,640
You'll find the princess.

720
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,980
Thank you.

721
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,020
Your Majesty,

722
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,500
Hao Du has sent a message.

723
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,460
The Princess of Yongheng modules had appeared at the Cloud Episode.

724
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,220
is not true.

725
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,340
Du Qian, get up.

726
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,020
Send my order.

727
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,820
The people of Luoyang, Yunzhou

728
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,380
are sending people to find Yan'er.

729
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,180
We must find her

730
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,420
and send her back to me safely.

731
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,780
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

732
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,660
I've made arrangements for this.

733
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,220
Princess Yong'an will definitely be able to overcome the crisis.

734
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,260
Please don't think too much, Your Majesty.

735
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,580
How can I not worry about this?

736
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,820
The situation is getting worse.

737
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,180
There are more and more refugees.

738
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,980
The situation in Chang'an is still good.

739
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,100
The people of Luoyang are everywhere.

740
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,180
They are always in trouble.

741
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,380
They are in dire straits.

742
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,500
I can't bear to hear it.

743
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,540
It's indeed a big deal

744
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,740
to pacify the refugees.

745
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,340
The people of Luoyang

746
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,500
are my people.

747
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,140
I have endless concerns.

748
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,780
But I can't get away from it.

749
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,740
Du Qian,

750
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
how about I arrange the Crown Prince to go to Luoyang

751
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,180
to pacify the refugees for me?

752
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,660
Your Majesty loves the people.

753
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,980
You can go to pacify them.

754
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,740
I believe the people of Luoyang

755
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,100
will feel your whole-heartedness.

756
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,980
The Crown Prince is playing a trick.

757
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,260
I can't rest assured.

758
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,220
I have to send someone to follow him

759
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,300
to take care of the refugees.

760
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,980
Ask the man from Wei family to go with him.

761
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,500
He is very cautious.

762
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,260
With him by his side,

763
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,460
the Crown Prince won't be too out of line.

764
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

765
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,300
I have finished my work.

766
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,980
I will go to Luoyang soon.

767
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
Why do you go to Luoyang?

768
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,660
Ashile Tribe has retreated.

769
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,820
But we can't stay here for long.

770
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,780
There will be a war in the future.

771
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,820
I don't think it's a good time to stay here.

772
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,740
I am not feeling well recently.

773
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,820
I want to find a better candidate in Luoyang

774
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,220
to take over the post of Minister of War.

775
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,460
Who?

776
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,260
The man who is responsible for the money and equipment.

777
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,180
My lady, have a seat.

778
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,540
It's okay. I am not tired.

779
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,300
You С 알 sept attracted a fire in your eyes.

780
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,180
Xiaowu.

781
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,220
My lady.

782
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,100
Xiaowu.

783
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,980
Forget it.

784
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,460
You are tired.

785
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,320
Xiao Wu.

786
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,860
What gave me such a serious headache?

787
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,020
Don't say anything, you are only what you are now.

788
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,620
I am exhausted.

789
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Don't say that.

790
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,180
Luo Yang will be here soon.

791
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,180
See you then.

792
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,380
Wu.

793
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,740
Wu, don't sleep. Wu.

794
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,980
Wu, don't sleep. Wu.

795
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Wu, wake up.

796
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,900
You can't sleep, Your Highness. Wu.

797
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,540
Houchi.

798
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,620
You're really the princess.

799
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,780
I'm really the princess.

800
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,500
When we get to Luo Yang,

801
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,100
I'll give you everything you want.

802
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,500
Think about what you want.

803
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,060
Don't sleep.

804
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,020
I want...

805
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,860
I want you

806
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,620
to give me a lot of rice.

807
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,620
I haven't eaten rice yet.

808
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,620
Okay.

809
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,260
I'll give you a whole cart of rice

810
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,740
to feed you, okay?

811
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,300
Okay.

812
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,980
If you're really the princess,

813
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,380
you must be the world's...

814
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,700
best princess.

815
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,940
Wu, be good.

816
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,940
We're almost there.

817
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,340
It's just ahead of us.

818
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,540
Everything will be fine when we get there.

819
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:01,940
Come on.

820
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,340
screwed up

821
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,340
Rezeal of Wei Shu.

822
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,140
Wei Shuyu.

823
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,900
Who do you think

824
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,540
Look.

825
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,900
No clothes, no staff, no aura.

826
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,500
Do you want my face?

827
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,660
Your Highness, please calm down.

828
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,940
His Majesty has always been a wise man.

829
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,820
You should take the emperor's advice

830
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,500
and take the necessary measures.

831
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,220
Now the disaster in Luoyang is approaching.

832
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,980
If you can take responsibility

833
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,500
and show your determination to share difficulties with the people,

834
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,260
the people of the world will surely sing your merit.

835
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,620
I don't think I have to take the necessary measures.

836
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,500
Look.

837
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,860
Look at the carriage.

838
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,060
It's almost the end of the year.

839
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,500
Why don't you just let me ride the horse to Luoyang?

840
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,860
The carriage can't be broken.

841
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,020
Even if it's broken,

842
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,700
we can go to the station and change another one.

843
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,540
I hope you can leave as soon as possible.

844
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,820
You can go one day earlier

845
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,340
and bring the emperor's grace to the people one day earlier.

846
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,300
To show the emperor and the emperor's understanding of the people's hearts.

847
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,060
But I'm not the Dragon King.

848
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,220
If I arrive,

849
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,460
it will rain.

850
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,620
I'm going to have fun.

851
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,260
Now it's all ruined.

852
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,260
What a bad timing.

853
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,460
Father doesn't know what to do.

854
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,500
I'm going to leave.

855
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,580
I can't take those fun things with me.

856
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,020
Your Highness, please leave.

857
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,180
I'm not necessarily the most evil prince

858
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,340
in the world.

859
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,620
I'm definitely the most evil prince.

860
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Sister.

861
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,500
Is Luoyang here?

862
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,220
It's almost there, Wu.

863
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,060
Luoyang is right ahead.

864
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,540
Sister.

865
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,700
Did you hear that?

866
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,220
Mother is calling me.

867
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,500
Wu.

868
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
Tell your mother to wait for you.

869
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,820
Don't go to your mother yet.

870
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,460
I'll take you to Luoyang now.

871
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,740
Wu.

872
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,020
Look.

873
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,260
The pass ahead.

874
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,340
As long as you pass the pass ahead,

875
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,780
Luoyang is ahead.

876
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,580
I'll take you to eat white rice.

877
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,820
The white rice

878
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,260
smells so good.

879
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
The white rice

880
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,460
is gone.

881
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,180
It's scattered.

882
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,380
The sand between the fingers

883
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,660
is like the tea.

884
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,620
Wu.

885
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,020
I'll take you to Luoyang.

886
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,780
I'll take you to eat white rice.

887
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,580
Stop.

888
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,820
The Ming family has ordered

889
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,540
that no one is allowed to enter

890
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,820
in case of infection.

891
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,780
No one is allowed?

892
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,340
I think the man on your back is dead.

893
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
You can pass the pass.

894
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,460
But he can't.

895
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,340
He's not dead.

896
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,180
Take him down.

897
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,140
What are you doing?

898
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,100
What are you doing?

899
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,140
Let me go.

900
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,180
Wu.

901
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,700
Wu.

902
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
Let me go.

903
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,060
Wu.

904
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,060
Wu.

905
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,860
Wu.

906
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,540
How dare you!

907
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,540
How dare you do that to an official?

908
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,340
Wu.

909
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,500
Wu.

910
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,660
Open your eyes and look at me.

911
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Get out of here.

912
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,500
Yes.

913
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,300
Open your eyes and look at me, Wu.

914
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,220
Your Highness.

915
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,020
I've finally found you.

916
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,020
Hao Du.

917
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,860
Let's go.

918
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
I'll take you home.

919
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,220
Why?

920
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,460
I'm not dead.

921
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,820
If I could be faster,

922
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,820
if I tried harder,

923
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,740
I wouldn't have died.

924
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,260
Why?

925
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,260
Why?

926
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:45,180
The love that flows through the years

927
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,620
There's always a moment

928
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:54,460
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

929
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,940
There's always a longing

930
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:04,540
that meets everything between you and me

931
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,860
In different worlds

932
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,140
In different worlds

933
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,260
In different worlds

934
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,860
I'll be there forever

935
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,660
In the deep night

936
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,700
I'll be there forever

937
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,420
In the dark night

938
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,900
There's always a moment

939
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,740
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

940
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,220
There's always a longing

941
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:48,820
that meets everything between you and me

942
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,140
In different worlds

943
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,500
In different worlds

944
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,100
I'll be there forever

945
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,860
In the deep night

946
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,980
I'll be there forever

947
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,220
In the dark night

948
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,940
In the dark night
