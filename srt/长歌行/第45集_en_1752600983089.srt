00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and heard it with my own ears,

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I wouldn't believe all of this.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The reason I kept it hidden

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and didn't show it,

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
was to see what Ashile Tribe

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
was doing.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't expect

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
they would still

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
spread the news of the troops.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I couldn't bear it anymore.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's why I came forward to testify.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When the priest died,

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the Red River jumped out

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and stopped the alliance.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why don't you all remember

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
who was the first one

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to spread the news

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that Ashile Tribe was going to attack the desert

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
in the Four-Defence Hall?

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It was the Tiele Tribe.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It was the Tiele Tribe.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The Five-Defence Hall

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The Five-Defence Hall

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Eat it.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Even if you die,

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I won't let you

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
go back to your mother.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If your mother finds out,

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
she will be sad.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You won't see her again.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Only you will be by my side.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No one can separate us.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're so quiet today.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought you'd be like when you were a kid

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and keep nagging at me.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't take it too seriously.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Did you have a fight with Yicheng?

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's my mother.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't call her by her name.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was hard to get together with my mother.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But we're not on good terms.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's really...

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Stop acting like a child.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You used the secret

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to get the information.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Now you're acting like a child.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I really look down on you.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'd do anything for Changge.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What kind of woman

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
is Li Changge?

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You and Mimi even risked your lives

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
for her.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You don't need to know.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm just curious about her.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm even a little jealous.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ashile Sun.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
For Li Changge,

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
can you really give up Ashile Tribe?

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're willing to be in jail today.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You've put Ashile Tribe aside, haven't you?

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know if Anna will hate me.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've been waiting for so long.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Finally, I've waited for this day.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
At this moment,

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I will never give up.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sher.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
One day,

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you'll come back to me.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is so interesting.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The play of the fake death of Zhixi

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is so amazing.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Changge,

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
what did you think of?

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was thinking of using the old trick

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to save the behind-the-scenes.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But even so,

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't take the size of Yicheng.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It may also harm

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the Chiheng family.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What does that mean?

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Threatening with the family's blood.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is the usual method

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
of Yicheng in other tribes.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This Yicheng is really a devil.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So we can't be careless.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Maybe he has other backup plans.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's possible that

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
there's still Chini in Chang'an.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hao Du,

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I need your help.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't move.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you all for today.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Guard the hall,

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and protect the bandit.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
One more person is missing.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You mean the man by Yicheng's side?

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
His name is Yang Cheng.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But we are

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,820
secretly

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We have to let Leyan

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
enter the palace before the meal.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And report to the state.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Go.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Leyan.

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The tea house outside the hall.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Go.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Go.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Leyan.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Leyan.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't be rash.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Get the clothes out.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hao Du.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He just wants to take away Chini.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He won't hurt Leyan.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Princess, you are really smart.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We'll pay you back.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hao Du, we can't.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I said three times.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We decide

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
what to do.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Li Qiang.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Give me the clothes.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We'll pay him back.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hao Du.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
One.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Two.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Three.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Li Qiang.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, I'll let him go.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Qiang.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll take you there.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then they'll obey the order

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and let him go.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But you have the love of Tang.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you dare to touch him,

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you will not leave alive.

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Stop talking nonsense.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Throw the clothes here.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The clothes you say

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
is really killing yourself.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Stop talking.

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now that it's in your hands,

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
kill or kill,

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
it's up to you.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's almost done.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How is it?

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Did you tell the people?

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll tell the people in the morning.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then you can follow the plan.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then I'll reveal the truth

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and make it clear to the ambassadors.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let me.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Does it hurt?

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It can be crying.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't hold it in.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm still here.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Can you guys be more reserved?

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's right.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This time Hao Du made a great contribution.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That person will definitely grant you a marriage.

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Then I...

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, right.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He's not injured.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He won't be a big trouble to you.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go first.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sun.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you okay in the prison?

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're finally back.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Master has been waiting for you all night.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Father.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You called the soldiers without permission?

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Father.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The situation is urgent.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't explain it to you.

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you want to cut it off, then cut it off.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're really my son.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You have to be punished.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Follow me.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hurry.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Kneel.

193
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Kneel here.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Kneel here.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Bow.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Bow.

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's tired.

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Father.

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is against the rules.

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
From today onwards,

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you are our family's person.

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There will be your name on the family register.

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You are the son of my daughter-in-law.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Father.

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I know you are always proud.

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You want to climb to the top with your own abilities.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But since you want to be this Prince Consort,

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
as your father, I have to help you.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Father.

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Father.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Father.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Father.

213
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Father.

214
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You called the wrong person.

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You are already the son of my son-in-law.

216
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you understand?

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Father.

218
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Good.

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Child.

220
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Come with me to the palace to report to His Majesty.

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay.

222
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Your Majesty.

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yang Cheng is the son of Emperor Sui Yang.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
After he died,

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
he gathered all the soldiers of Wei who were with him.

226
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You are poisoned.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Let the poison come.

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Your Majesty.

229
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This group of people have all left their families.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They are like ghosts now.

231
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They call themselves Chimney and are loyal to Princess Yicheng.

232
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Although they admitted to spreading rumors,

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
it's a pity that only Yang Cheng and Yicheng are in contact.

234
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now Yang Cheng is not saying anything and even attempted suicide.

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So I'm afraid this time,

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
he can't be helped by Yicheng.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's not urgent.

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's not urgent.

239
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
A person who is close to him can still be far away.

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes.

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Everyone.

242
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is Yang Cheng who is with Yicheng.

243
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The commander of the Chiheng is also a spy.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The Chiheng thinks Yang Cheng is a spy.

245
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He is in alliance with the desert.

246
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The Tie Le Tribe will rise up.

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And it will become the new Ashile Tribe.

248
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The Ashile Tribe?

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes.

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't be surprised.

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yicheng has been far away for many years.

253
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He secretly made a plan.

254
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The Chiheng and the Tribe all obey Yang Cheng.

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Of course no one has seen him.

256
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yang Cheng listens to him and can only recognize him.

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It was all arranged by Yicheng.

258
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Princess Mobei is really good at painting.

259
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Just a few words will make the desert more beautiful.

260
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It also points to me.

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm a far away woman.

262
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How can I be the mastermind behind it?

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You said it yourself.

264
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We didn't say that.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't worry, Khatun.

266
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yang Cheng was interrogated in the court.

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He didn't know his own name.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He only wanted to die.

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We didn't save his life.

270
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We didn't even ask him.

271
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Moreover, Yang Cheng is so loyal.

272
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How could he betray Khatun?

273
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Everyone doesn't dare to say anything about Khatun.

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How could I dare to spill Khatun's dirty water?

275
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Since you know it's a slander,

276
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
let's all leave.

277
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What are you doing here?

278
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The Ministry of Rites Special Envoy is here.

279
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Everyone,

280
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
this is the promise I, the Emperor of Tang,

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
wrote to you personally.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
In short,

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
if you want to fight,

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Tang will join you.

285
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Tang is compatible with the various departments.

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The people are well-educated and wise.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They are willing to fight against the disaster and trade with each other.

288
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If there's anything you need,

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Tang will not break it.

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If Tang has a slave operation,

291
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it's a contract that will be abolished.

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you want to fight against the enemy,

293
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
it's a contract that will be abolished.

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll be the leader for my Tata.

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I, Mo Nan, will be the first to sign the contract.

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's sign it.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's form an alliance with Tang.

299
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Let's sign it.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Tang.

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Tang.

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Tata has a good plan.

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wait.

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hao Du.

305
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You are a man of great merit.

306
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But you are a man of great merit.

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You sent troops without permission and committed a crime.

308
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I am guilty.

309
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Father.

310
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I am the one who made the decision.

311
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It has nothing to do with Hao Du.

312
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So I'll punish you for being the leader of the Prince Consort.

313
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

314
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I just didn't want to disturb your mood.

315
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This matter...

316
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Princess.

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Prince Consort.

318
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Father.

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
My daughter is really grown up.

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hao Du.

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I...

322
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Younger Brother Du.

323
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll leave Yan'er to you.

324
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You have to treat her well.

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If my daughter ruins your future,

326
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
or if she is too old to be loved,

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I won't blame you.

328
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But you must take her back to me.

329
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

330
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I will take good care of the princess.

332
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Not because she is the princess,

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
but because she is Leyan.

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay.

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Take a young man to send the alliance letter back.

336
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You two can finish your wedding on time.

337
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

338
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can't sign this alliance letter.

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can't watch everyone

340
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
being pushed into the fire pit by this fake princess.

341
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You can't.

342
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Fake?

343
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
She is not a Mobei princess at all.

344
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Her real identity is

345
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
the one who was killed in the whole family.

346
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Li Changge, the daughter of the former crown prince of Tang.

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's her.

348
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
She is not a Mobei princess.

349
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What's going on?

350
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I can't believe it.

351
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The daughter of the former crown prince.

352
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's impossible.

353
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Mimi Guli.

354
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I will never allow you to ruin the princess's plan.

355
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This...

356
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's you who was killed by Li Changge.

357
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
She just wants to take the opportunity

358
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to take over the whole family.

359
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What she wants is

360
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
a battle that was fought by the Emperor of Tang.

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This way, the Tang army can use their energy in the battle.

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
This way,

363
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
she can avenge the Emperor.

364
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If Li Changge does anything again,

365
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you can expose her in front of everyone.

366
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Otherwise, your brother will be killed

367
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and Mu Jin.

368
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Mu Jin?

369
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You think I don't know that Mu Jin has sneaked into Dingxiang?

370
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Maybe he is suffering in the hands of Lei Meng now.

371
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm wrong no matter what he says.

372
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm begging you.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Please forgive me.

374
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I won't die without killing Mu Jin.

375
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm wrong in everything.

376
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm listening to you.

377
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It depends on whether you are good or not.

378
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
For hatred,

379
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
she can cooperate with the Emperor of Tang

380
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
as a member of the Tang army.

381
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
She doesn't care about the three wars,

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the life and the death.

383
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So this time,

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Li Changge is just a model.

385
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What is this?

386
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What model?

387
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What model?

388
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

389
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes.

390
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
She can't be too hasty.

391
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes.

392
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
She should be like Tong Changjin.

393
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes.

394
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Take Li Changge down for now.

395
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I will go to His Majesty and wait for his decision.

396
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes.

397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Changge.

398
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Changgu,

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Changgu,

400
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
is going to the court..

401
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Changgu,

402
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Changgu.

403
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Changgu.

404
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Long Feizong.

405
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,640
Is it sincere?

406
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,880
Yicheng,

407
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,800
Yicheng caused Changge to die last night.

408
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,800
But...

409
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,960
Father,

410
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,640
Changge...

411
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
Yicheng,

412
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,680
when did he find out about Changge's identity?

413
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,760
I don't know.

414
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,720
Now, some emissaries of colleagues from the Ancient国

415
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,640
are afraid they can't wait

416
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,320
to see

417
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,960
how can I

418
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,600
Yes.

419
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
The Ministry of the desert is afraid of my Tang,

420
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,440
not Li Changge.

421
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,080
So you mean

422
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,920
they don't trust me?

423
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,440
I don't dare to.

424
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,000
But I think

425
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
even if Li Changge is killed,

426
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,160
it's still a good thing.

427
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,360
What do you think we should do?

428
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,440
I dare not say it.

429
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,840
Yan,

430
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,000
you once said

431
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,520
Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji are related.

432
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,520
Now the identity of the maid in Jiancheng

433
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,560
is known to the world.

434
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,560
It's a good thing.

435
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,160
If the emperor is wrong,

436
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,560
I will

437
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
kill him.

438
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Yan.

439
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,560
Young Master,

440
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,320
go to see Yicheng tomorrow.

441
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,920
He's going to be

442
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:47,320
released from the

443
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,080
hands of the people of Zha'sle.

444
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,880
Yan,

446
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
no one will hurt Changge, right?

447
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,400
Yan, get up.

448
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,000
Yan, remember.

449
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,760
Kill or fight,

450
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,680
it's never a good thing.

451
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
It's good to have a strong army.

452
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,640
It's good to have a conspiracy.

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,080
If you want to come,

454
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,480
Tang will never give in.

455
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,560
It's not just up to the emperor.

456
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,560
You must,

457
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,860
I'm sure.

458
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,320
Here, take it!

459
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,720
It's yours.

460
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,800
You don't have one?

461
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
It seems that your mother didn't play with money.

462
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I'm not hungry.

463
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
You eat it. I'll take it as a gift for you.

464
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
No need.

465
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
You eat it.

466
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
I don't want to see the God of Heaven.

467
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm a hungry dead man.

468
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
I don't believe we can't get out.

469
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Are you confident in Tang Huang

470
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
or your mother?

471
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
I'm confident in your Li Changge.

472
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
If she is a righteous person,

473
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
she will never let you die here.

474
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Why do you die here?

475
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
I hope she won't be involved in this anymore.

476
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Sher.

477
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
If we can get out alive this time,

478
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I will continue to be your enemy.

479
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
I will fight until death.

480
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Ashile Tribe,

481
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Tang,

482
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Qiansui.

483
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Are these really so important?

484
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Why must they be involved?

485
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Can't you and your Li Changge

486
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
find a peaceful place

487
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
to live a peaceful life?

488
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Isn't that good?

489
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Of course it's good.

490
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Only if the world is truly peaceful

491
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
can the people be free.

492
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Khatun.

493
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Your Majesty,

494
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
you only want to let Mr. Wei come?

495
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
I wanted to kill the Eastern Palace

496
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
because of my personal feelings.

497
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
I only admit that

498
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Khatun and Xiao Kehan

499
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
are the ones behind this.

500
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Your Majesty, you have to investigate

501
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
this important case

502
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
in person.

503
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
I really can't wait.

504
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Mr. Wei, you are so open-minded.

505
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Then I won't go around.

506
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Let my son go.

507
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
I dare to promise

508
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
that within five years,

509
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Ashile Tribe

510
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
will never let you die.

511
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
The treaty was supposed to be signed.

512
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
But the leader of the alliance

513
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
was Li Jiancheng's daughter.

514
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
So they all gave up the alliance.

515
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,720
This is the way to form an alliance.

516
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
The so-called promise

517
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
is just a simple word, right?

518
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
What does Your Majesty want?

519
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I heard that Ashile Tribe

520
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
has a lot of

521
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
military weapons

522
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
in the desert.

523
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm afraid that

524
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
there are many

525
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
military uniforms in the desert.

526
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
The Tang Dynasty has a great appetite.

527
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Khatun,

528
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
people are worried now.

529
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
If you want to stabilize

530
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
the emissaries of the desert,

531
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
you should show your power

532
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
to the Tang Dynasty.

533
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Khatun is willing to see me.

534
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
I'm afraid he won't

535
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
not know this.

536
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Sorry.

537
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
I really can't help you this time.

538
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
The alliance failed?

539
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
The one who is unwilling to move away

540
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
will take the nine cities.

541
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
That means

542
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
we can work hard

543
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
for the city.

544
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
The rest of the city

545
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
is being cleaned up.

546
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
We are going back to the desert tomorrow.

547
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
I'm sorry.

549
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
I'm sorry.

552
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Where is Sun?

554
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Ashile Sun

555
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
and Ashile Sher

556
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
have special identities.

557
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
They are locked in the prison

558
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
and are not allowed to be explored.

559
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
But they are all officials

560
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
and they don't fight.

561
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Changge,

562
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Ashile Sun

563
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
doesn't care about his identity,

564
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
but he also has to be dragged into the water

565
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
and is very selfish.

566
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
He did this

567
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
is very likely

568
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
to be related to your

569
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
almost being killed.

570
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
He saved me more than one or two times.

571
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
If it wasn't for him,

572
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
maybe I would have died

573
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
the day I fell from the cliff.

574
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
You knew each other for a long time.

575
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
So he saved you.

576
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
If Ashile Sun

577
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
can get through this time,

578
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
as a brother,

579
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
I can trust you

580
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
to give it to him.

581
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Before I met him,

582
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
I never thought

583
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
I could live and die with someone.

584
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
But after I met him,

585
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I never thought

586
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I could live and die with someone.

587
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Your Majesty.

588
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Yicheng

589
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
agreed?

590
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Yes.

591
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Ashile's department

592
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
will return to Dingxiang tomorrow.

593
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
He asked Little Khan

594
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
to leave with him

595
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
in front of the people of the desert.

596
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
He is lucky to have thought it out.

597
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Let him go.

598
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Your Majesty.

599
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
He also wants Ashile Sun.

600
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Day four.

601
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
It's the first time

602
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
I've been locked up for so long.

603
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm afraid

604
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
I might die.

605
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
It seems that the situation

606
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
is not optimistic.

607
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
What?

608
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Are you afraid of death?

609
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
When will a warrior

610
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
on the prairie be afraid of death?

611
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
If you are really

612
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
framed to death,

613
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
I'm sorry.

614
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
I didn't hear wrong, right?

615
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Do you know that

616
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
it's good to die?

617
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
There are some things

618
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
that I can't say clearly now.

619
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
There will be no more chances in the future.

620
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Sher.

621
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
If you want to blame,

622
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
blame yourself for being

623
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
a little Khan of Ashile's department.

624
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
No chance?

625
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
I don't think so.

626
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
My Ashile Sher's life is tough.

627
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
The prison in the Tang Dynasty

628
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
will definitely be trapped.

629
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Hey.

630
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Wild man.

631
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
If we can really go out,

632
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
apologize to me.

633
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Drink with me.

634
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Maybe I can forgive you.

635
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Forgive?

636
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
As long as you are still

637
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Yicheng's son,

638
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I am still Khan's son,

639
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
it's impossible between you and me.

640
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Sher.

641
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Forgive?

642
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
In the next life.

643
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Do you really think you are dead?

644
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
You never

645
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
said such a sad thing before.

646
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Let me ask you.

647
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
If you live again,

648
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
what do you want to do?

649
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I don't know.

650
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
But I will never leave the prairie.

651
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
The prairie is so good.

652
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
It's both vast and beautiful.

653
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
You don't need too many soldiers.

654
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
You don't need any men.

655
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Just be with the one you like.

656
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Go horse riding, hunt,

657
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
and have fun.

658
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
At this point,

659
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
you think of me.

660
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Who wants to think of you?

661
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
What are you doing?

662
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Ashile Sun,

663
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
you can't go with them.

664
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
The criminal is the king.

665
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
Thank you for your reminder.

666
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
You are welcome.

667
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Take him away.

668
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
If you want to kill him,

669
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
I am not against it.

670
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
As long as you don't touch me.

671
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
But...

672
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
The crown prince of Tang.

673
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
How dare you

674
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
dare to attack me.

675
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I accidentally hit it.

676
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
It's not like I want to kill him.

677
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
You are not afraid of me.

678
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
You don't have to kill me.

679
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,720
I thought I wouldn't do it in the prison.

680
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I was afraid I would leave a mark.

681
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
But the little Khan

682
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
made me lose face.

683
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
I am lucky.

684
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
I didn't hit him.

685
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
I am not fierce.

686
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
I can finally

687
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
avenge my good friend.

688
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
You...

689
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
How dare you hit me.

690
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Your Highness,

691
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
why do you have to kill Ashile Sun?

692
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Because he killed Sheng Xin.

693
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
Everyone in the world

694
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
is comparing with Sheng Xin.

695
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
They think her life

696
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
is not worth pursuing.

697
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
If I

698
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
don't kill her for my good friend,

699
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
she will die in vain.

700
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
But Sheng Xin is the one who has a ghost in her heart.

701
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
The person who is next to you...

702
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Nonsense.

703
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Hao Du has already

704
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
beaten Chi Ni and Prince of Bu Yi.

705
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
They have confessed.

706
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
When they were in Luoyang,

707
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
they put Sheng Xin

708
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
next to you

709
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
to confuse your mind.

710
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
They used your convenience

711
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
to make trouble.

712
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
The flowers are all in place.

713
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
The prisoners are also in place.

714
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
If you don't believe me,

715
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
you can interrogate them yourself.

716
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Your Majesty,

717
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I want to check it out.

718
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Your Majesty.

719
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
The Eagle Division is very diligent.

720
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
They are unwilling to

721
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
bow to the emperor of Tang.

722
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Of course.

723
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Moreover,

724
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
the people of Li Changge

725
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
are unwilling to bow to his second uncle.

726
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Let me see

727
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
what you can do

728
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
for my niece.

729
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
There are two ways in front of you.

730
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
You have seen this box before.

731
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
It contains Changge's household register.

732
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
I added your share.

733
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
From now on,

734
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
you change your name and change your surname.

735
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
You and Changge stay in Chang'an.

736
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
It's no longer the Ashile Tribe.

737
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
I will leave you to your own business.

738
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Changge has already

739
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
rejected this path.

740
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
So I leave this thing to you.

741
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
You don't want to see him

742
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
suffer anymore, do you?

743
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
I only want him to do what he wants to do.

744
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Moreover,

745
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
I will never abandon

746
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Ashile Tribe.

747
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Then the second path

748
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
is not that easy.

749
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Do you understand

750
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
what I mean?

751
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Yes.

752
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
For Changge,

753
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
are you willing to risk your life?

754
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I will do whatever I can.

755
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Before you leave Chang'an,

756
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
you have to meet someone else.

757
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
I will wait for you.

758
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
He is my friend.

759
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Why do you all lie to me?

760
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Is it because I am very stupid?

761
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Of course not.

762
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Your Highness is just kind.

763
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
You are too trusting.

764
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
You don't need me to comfort you.

765
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I know it in my heart.

766
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Actually, A'Ye can't stop me.

767
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
This is the first time I want to

768
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,720
work hard for someone.

769
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
I want to help him.

770
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
I want to avenge him.

771
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
But in the end,

772
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
it's just a joke.

773
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
You were alone

774
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
for your friend.

775
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Now you find out that the dress is fake.

776
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
Have you ever regretted it?

777
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I regretted it.

778
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Will you still

779
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
trust someone

780
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
without any reservation?

781
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
I will.

782
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,720
But I don't think

783
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I will be so blind.

784
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Isn't that great?

785
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
You have grown up.

786
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
What about you?

787
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
Have you ever tried to

788
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
get back what you regretted?

789
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Your Highness,

790
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
the past can't be chased.

791
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
We should look forward.

792
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,720
My heart is like yours

793
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,720
before we say goodbye.

794
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,720
I remember your figure

795
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,720
in my dream of love.

796
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Before dawn,

797
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
through the years,

798
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,720
my longing flows.

799
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,720
There's always a moment

800
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,720
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

801
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,720
There's always a moment

802
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,720
that we meet each other.

803
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
In different worlds,

804
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
in different worlds,

805
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,720
I miss you.

806
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
After the years,

807
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
we became the sword

808
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,720
in the dark night.

809
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,720
There's always a moment

810
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,720
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

811
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,720
There's always a moment

812
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,720
that we meet each other.

813
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
In different worlds,

814
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
in different worlds,

815
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,720
I miss you.

816
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,720
After the years,

817
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,720
we became the sword

818
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,720
in the dark night.

819
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I miss you.

820
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
I miss you.
