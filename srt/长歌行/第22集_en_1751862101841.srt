1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The dream is a frost, the heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is frosty, the sword is broken

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The broken wings are still flying

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Forgetting you

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The memory of this wine is like a stronghold

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After the life, don't forget the light

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I heard from Quanziyan

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Princess Yongning went to Ashile Tribe before the negotiation

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So you think it's Changge?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But I believe

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If Princess Yongning knows about the assassination

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She will do her best to save her

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If it's what Changge did

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will feel even more guilty

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will feel even more guilty

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Have you seen this woman in the portrait?

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I haven't seen her

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sir

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I haven't seen her

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are from the team who set off from Yunzhou

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How can you not see her?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sir

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look at us

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We have left Yunzhou

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There are people who don't leave

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And people who follow other teams

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And people who don't know which direction they are going

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's so strange about this?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Right?

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Right?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What's so strange about this?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know her

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I really haven't seen her

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Right

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's late

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Princess, where are you?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your Majesty

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,660
The

47
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,000
Emperor has come to report

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He has found out the source

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who set up this?

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a man from Ashile Tribe

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A man named Jin Rui

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yan Li has accused him

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now they are back to the prairie

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong?

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They have gone back to the prairie

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mr. Wei

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When you knew this news

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What did you think?

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't be nervous

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's just a chat

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I dare not lie to you

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My first thought is

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not Changge

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please forgive me

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think so too

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Go

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Go

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Khatun, Great Khan is back

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A'Yi

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Go to the tent with me

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To welcome the Great Khan

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Khatun

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I heard that Yuan Zheng

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
has come back without any success

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You should be careful

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
when you see the Great Khan

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Welcome the Great Khan back

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please drink

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
100,000 soldiers

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You didn't bring anything back

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you drinking?

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You look like you are crying

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will be angry when I see you

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't come to me again

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Khan

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The Great Khan is here to greet you

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He is here to greet me?

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think he wants me to die

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let him reflect on himself

95
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't want to see him

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you standing here?

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Get out

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sun, you are back

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Are you okay?

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How is it?

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Did you see the military counselor?

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He was caught by the camera

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He is back to the palace

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Changge, what happened?

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I am preparing a gift

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I am going to the palace

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You just came back

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why are you going to the palace?

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
To report military affairs

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Where is the military affairs?

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will go now

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I will go with you

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I want to see it too

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mimi

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You are back

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am going to the palace

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will go with you

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will go with you

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will go with you

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I will go with you

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will go with you

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mimi, stop it

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Even if you go, you can't save Changge

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Didn't you hear him?

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Changge was caught

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Am I going to wait here?

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Aren't you going to the palace?

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why are you wiping your knife?

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It will be the Kulitai meeting in three days

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I want to ask the Great Khan

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
To fight with Sher on Kulitai

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I want to win back Changge

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Sun, are you crazy?

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That guy can't find a good reason

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
To kill you

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And you sent him to him

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You can be kind

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But he can't

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't either

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mimi is going to the palace with you

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't take her there

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's too dangerous

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's too dangerous

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm worried about you going alone

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I can't let Changge stay there

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Tegin, take me with you

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you going to do?

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Changge must be cold and hungry now

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe he is still injured

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I brought him food and medicine

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Give me the thing

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I must see how he is now

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tegin, take me there

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I will have the medicine

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It will be useful

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Khan

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Khan

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Khan

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We just saw

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The slave from the Central Plains you brought back

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You didn't see him?

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We have seen him

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When?

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
When he was in Youzhou

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He helped Ashile Sun

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He is that bastard's friend

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I believe you, Khan

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Leave this man alive

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I will save him

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can't watch him die

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
As expected

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Their relationship is not ordinary

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Tong Luke

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Go to the slave camp and bring him back

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Tegin

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Have you seen a new slave?

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have seen a new slave

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He has a mole under his eyes

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Xun Tegin

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I have seen him

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Where is he?

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The man from Khan

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Brought him to the archery field

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Wait for me here

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Women are not allowed to enter the archery field

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You will only have more trouble if you go

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Go

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I will ask you again

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ashile Sun

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That bastard

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let you join the Wolf Division

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you want to do?

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In front of Khan

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You want to frame my Wolf Division?

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know what Khan is talking about

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You think my Wolf Division

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is the same as that dog-shitting Eagle Division

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That doesn't kill slaves?

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I count three more times

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You still have time to regret

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's go to see Khan together

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You go to tell him that you are from Eagle Division

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I am not

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Good

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It seems that you are not afraid of death

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Vanzer

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you are crazy

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It seems that your relationship with this guy is angry

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
For this guy

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You really fight against me

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,040
Let's bring everything out first.

220
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,840
Young Master,

221
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,240
let's use this as cover

222
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
and turn him into a Colombia.

223
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
Ver ludzi generations

224
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,720
are western broadcast stolen music,

225
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,240
not the western sign.

226
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,600
Who taught you that?

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,920
I professional already know

228
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,520
I have nothing to argue with you.

229
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,520
Don't refuse me in a hurry.

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,320
Since you care about this little man so much,

231
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
why don't you take him as a pawn?

232
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
What do you mean?

233
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you remember when we were kids,

234
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,720
we often shot arrows to get a little money?

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,200
No.

236
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,440
It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

237
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,080
I remember it clearly.

238
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,040
The first time we fought,

239
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:33,220
I was обtr

240
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,720
All to you.

241
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,720
Yes.

242
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,120
Go go go

243
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,760
Go then

244
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
You lost that time.

245
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
It was in the past.

246
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
This time, it's not certain.

247
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,540
You not only lost that time,

248
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
but also played tricks.

249
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Bu Han!

250
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
You're here.

251
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm here.

252
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
I'm here.

253
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm here.

254
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm here.

255
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,000
The

256
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Sheng'er,

257
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
have you played enough this time?

258
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
The bet is that there will be three rounds.

259
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
You can't lose a round.

260
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,040
This time, let's try this little thing.

261
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
You!

262
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
What? You feel bad?

263
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Or am I not like this in your eyes?

264
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
He's too young.

265
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
There's a wind at this time. You can't shoot him.

266
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Ashile Sun,

267
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
you're too arrogant.

268
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
You can shoot me, of course I can.

269
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
You're too arrogant.

270
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
You're too arrogant.

271
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
You're too arrogant.

272
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
You're too arrogant.

273
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
You're too arrogant.

274
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
You're too arrogant.

275
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
You're too arrogant.

276
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
You're too arrogant.

277
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
You're too arrogant.

278
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
You're too arrogant.

279
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
You're too arrogant.

280
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
You're too arrogant.

281
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
You're too arrogant.

282
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
You're too arrogant.

283
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Sheng'er!

285
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
You suffered.

286
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Why are you here?

287
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,040
I...

288
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm here to report to Great Khan about the military affairs.

289
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
Sun Ceqi!

290
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Great Khan has summoned you back to the tent to report.

291
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
Go now!

292
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Ashile Sun,

293
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
no one got the last round right.

294
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
You can only count on your own.

295
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,640
You can't have this person.

296
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
You can go now.

297
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
I'll be fine.

298
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Sun.

299
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
I'll take you away

300
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
in a few days.

301
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
It's boring.

302
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,040
Tu Ruke, take her back.

303
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,040
Yes.

304
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Go in!

305
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Changge!

306
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Mimi.

307
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Changge.

308
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Why are you here?

309
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
What's wrong with you?

310
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,640
Are you okay?

311
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Li Changge!

312
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,240
Sun Ceqi told me

313
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,840
that you'll take care of yourself.

314
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,440
You're taking care of yourself like this.

315
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
Why are you laughing?

316
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm fine.

317
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Touch it if you don't believe me.

318
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,040
No.

319
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm fine.

320
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Come here.

321
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,040
Come here.

322
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
It hurts.

323
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,440
If you don't take care of yourself,

324
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,240
I'll...

325
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640
Just break my head.

326
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Okay?

327
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'll take care of you.

328
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,640
You're joking about this?

329
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,640
Don't worry. I'm fine.

330
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
I'll be fine.

331
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,440
I'll wait for your soup.

332
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,640
Eagle Division is indeed brave and good at fighting.

333
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,640
Their military skills are very good.

334
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,040
In this battle,

335
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,240
the casualties are the least.

336
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,240
Thanks to you, father.

337
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
You've done a great job.

338
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,440
I'll reward you heavily.

339
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Thank you, father.

340
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,640
You don't have to reward me.

341
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
I have a favor to ask you.

342
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
Say it.

343
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
In three days,

344
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,040
the competition will be held in the Kulitai.

345
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I want to participate in the duel

346
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
and win the reward from Tian Lang.

347
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,840
Please allow me.

348
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
It's a small thing.

349
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I promise you.

350
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,040
You're indeed my son.

351
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
In three days,

352
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,840
I'll wait for you to win.

353
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
But

354
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,240
although I know what you're thinking,

355
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,440
I still want to remind you

356
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,040
that you can fight for victory.

357
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,640
But you can't be too hasty.

358
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,640
What's the rush?

359
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
I know.

360
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Don't worry, father.

361
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
I won't let you be embarrassed.

362
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,440
Good. That's good.

363
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,440
The Kulitai is coming.

364
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,840
Don't leave in a hurry if you're here.

365
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
Stay here for a few more days.

366
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,440
You and I will live in the same tent.

367
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
We can talk about marriage and fight for the sword.

368
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,640
Good.

369
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Report, Great Khan.

370
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,440
Li Tangluo has been captured.

371
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,240
He can be escorted to the tent today.

372
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Leave now.

373
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,240
Yes.

374
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,440
Tian Langshen.

375
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,040
I know

376
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,240
you won't treat me badly.

377
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,240
It's all destiny.

378
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Father.

379
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,040
What you said just now

380
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
is Li Tang's general, Luo Yi.

381
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Yes.

382
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
It's him.

383
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,440
He led the Tianjie Army

384
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,440
to guard Jingzhou for many years.

385
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I fought with him many times.

386
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,440
I've lost many times.

387
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
This time,

388
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,840
his good luck has come to an end.

389
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,640
I heard Luo Yi and Li Jiancheng are close friends.

390
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,640
So I hate Li's soldiers.

391
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,440
That's why I led the Tianjie Army

392
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,840
to rebel

393
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,840
and make Great Tang lose its defense.

394
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,840
But they escaped after the defeat.

395
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,040
How could they be captured by our army?

396
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,440
After Li's soldiers

397
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,040
defeated Luo Yi,

398
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,640
there were only a few trusted people around him.

399
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
He escaped

400
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
and escaped to the grassland.

401
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,240
When I got the news,

402
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,440
I sent the cavalry to search the border.

403
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
I didn't expect

404
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,640
I could capture him.

405
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,440
The Kulitai Conference is coming.

406
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,040
This is

407
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,240
a great gift from God Tian Langshen.

408
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,040
Congratulations, Father.

409
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,040
How do you plan to deal with him?

410
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,040
He's good at the battle and the deployment of the army.

411
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
If he can surrender to me this time,

412
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
our army can protect the God's will.

413
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,640
He will be able to break through the enemy's defense.

414
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,240
What if he doesn't surrender?

415
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,240
If he doesn't surrender,

416
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,040
I will torture him little by little

417
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,240
until his sharpness and power

418
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,240
can cut out the anger in my heart.

419
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,440
This is for you.

420
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,640
Remember to wipe it.

421
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
And this.

422
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
This is food.

423
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,440
But you have to hide it.

424
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,440
Don't let them take it away.

425
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
I've seen enough.

426
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,840
Go back.

427
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,040
This is not a place to stay for long.

428
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,440
If people know about it, they will wipe it.

429
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
I'm going to go.

430
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm going to go.

431
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm going to go.

432
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm going to go.

433
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
I'm going to go.

434
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I'm going to go.

435
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,040
I'm going to go.

436
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
I'm going to go.

437
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm going to go.

438
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm going to go.

439
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm going to go.

440
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Don't push me away.

441
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,040
Maybe we will see each other again.

442
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,240
Maybe.

443
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,640
I haven't finished the medicine you brought me.

444
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,640
I've returned to the Eagle Division.

445
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,440
Let's go.

446
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,440
No.

447
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Mimi.

448
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,960
Mimi, you go first.

449
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,840
Take care of yourself.

450
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,440
I've seen you before.

451
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,160
Where have you been all these years?

452
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,480
Mimi used to be a slave on the prairie.

453
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
And I thought you had...

454
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
Where do you live now?

455
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,480
I...

456
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
What are you doing?

457
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
Mimi is from Eagle Division now.

458
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
You live in Eagle Division now?

459
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,920
You're Ashile Sun's man?

460
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,880
Mimi, go back.

461
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,920
Yes.

462
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
Please forgive me, Young Khan.

463
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,760
I'll go back first.

464
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,200
Mimi.

465
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
Don't you have anything to say to me?

466
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,560
Li Changge is my friend.

467
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,880
Please don't kill him.

468
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
Okay?

469
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,880
Okay.

470
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,520
I promise you.

471
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
I promise.

472
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,160
I promised Mimi I would城 bothering you but you even Spring Bomb said nothing about it.

473
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,760
You坑ed hand and feet.

474
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,640
So, he gave you a hard time.

475
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,160
You're like this now.

476
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,560
You're still worried about me.

477
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,360
You're right.

478
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,640
I have to stay in Wangzhao.

479
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,800
I may not be able to come and accompany you.

480
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,520
Don't worry about me.

481
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,560
Mimi left me some things.

482
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,920
Three days.

483
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,640
Hold on for three more days.

484
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,560
After the Kulitai Conference is over,

485
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
I'll come and pick you up.

486
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,280
I'll go.

487
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,560
Ke Han.

488
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,480
Why are you so anxious?

489
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,120
Do you remember Mimi Kulitai?

490
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes.

491
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400
Why did the slave from Mobei

492
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,640
suddenly mention her?

493
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,000
Tell me.

494
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
Where did she go that year?

495
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,200
Why did she disappear without saying a word?

496
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,280
Ke Han was worried that you might lose your mind.

497
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,800
So he drove her out of the palace

498
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
and sent her to another place.

499
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
Then why is she now with Ashile Sun?

500
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,640
She became Ashile Sun's woman.

501
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
The slave who was awarded to Eagle Division

502
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,720
was picked by Da Ke Han himself.

503
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,440
Bastard!

504
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,240
So I was the only one who was kept in the dark.

505
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
Help me get that over here.

506
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,720
Okay.

507
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,480
Just put it here.

508
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,200
Go.

509
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,240
What are you waiting for?

510
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,120
Are you scared to death?

511
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
Ke Han told me

512
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,240
to keep an eye on you.

513
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,160
Don't think about escaping.

514
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,880
Get to work.

515
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,840
Ke Han.

516
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,880
Who was I so eager to see?

517
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
It was you.

518
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,360
It's been a long time.

519
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
Luo Yi, Luo Yi.

520
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,360
I almost can't recognize you.

521
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,280
Are you still Luo Yi,

522
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,200
the brave and good warrior?

523
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,120
Ashile Sun.

524
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
I heard that you led the army to fight

525
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,720
but returned empty-handed.

526
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,520
You're getting more and more useless.

527
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,760
You're all mixed up.

528
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,640
You're still so stubborn.

529
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,520
If you kneel down and surrender now

530
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,960
and rely on me, Ashile Sun,

531
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,200
to fight for the grassland,

532
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,280
I can immediately prepare wine

533
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,640
and make a toast to you.

534
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,640
Ashile Sun,

535
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,880
you've made a great dream.

536
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,840
How could I fight with you,

537
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,160
a dog-eating beast?

538
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,360
Take my life

539
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,640
and go to the other world.

540
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,360
You deserve to die.

541
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,440
You deserve to die.

542
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,360
You deserve to die.

543
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,200
General, you've been through a lot.

544
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,560
Tell him the truth for me.

545
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,560
Yes.

546
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,680
Go.

547
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,680
What are the oddities?

548
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm not.

549
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,440
Mimi encouraged her to sing.

550
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,720
She's a bit angry.

551
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,680
She's not angry at all.

552
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,560
I don't understand why Mimi is so good to him.

553
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,560
It's just a love between young men and women.

554
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,520
Why would you care about two slaves?

555
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,080
She's my slave.

556
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,520
Why would she like him?

557
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,760
That's the past.

558
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,920
She's just a maid.

559
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,320
She can have as much as she wants.

560
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,960
If you need it,

561
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,880
I'll get it for you now.

562
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,080
That's not what I mean.

563
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,000
Uncle Lei.

564
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,400
Tell him to send more men to her later.

565
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,440
Don't let her be idle.

566
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,280
Yes.

567
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,280
Who are you?

568
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm here to clear General's sheep.

569
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
What?

570
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,720
Hold on.

571
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,260
He was thenassing me.

572
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,200
Moreover,

573
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,220
I still habitually

574
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,460
He just called me general.

575
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,060
The traitor Ashile

576
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,820
won't call me general.

577
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,620
You have a incense?

578
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,620
You are the one who

579
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,540
set up the guards at the gate.

580
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,340
Are you going to save General Luo?

581
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,900
Who are you?

582
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,220
Ten years ago, in the Eastern Palace garden,

583
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,580
you gave me a foot bow.

584
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,900
You even praised me

585
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,460
for being a coward.

586
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,500
Princess Yongning?

587
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,220
Shiba, let go of me.

588
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,020
Don't be so impudent.

589
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,180
This is Yongning.

590
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,620
Why are we here?

591
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,940
It's a long story.

592
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,300
I'll save you first.

593
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,340
No need.

594
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,620
Even if you open the lock,

595
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,300
my legs

596
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,020
won't escape.

597
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,220
I won't escape.

598
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,620
Yan Li has hurt you so badly.

599
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,780
I've been on the road

600
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
and fought many battles.

601
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,660
I was careless

602
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,100
and hurt my right leg.

603
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,340
I'm much better

604
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,980
as long as you're alive.

605
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,740
Everything is hopeful.

606
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,220
It seems that Yan Li's suggestion

607
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,700
can be reconsidered.

608
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,300
Yongning, listen to me.

609
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,220
I'm not as good as you.

610
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
If I agree to cooperate with Ashile Tribe,

611
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,020
I can use his troops to guide Chang'an

612
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,020
and call the Crown Prince's Department

613
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,380
to kill the rebels and the common people in your name.

614
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,140
Never.

615
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,460
Why not?

616
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,340
Don't you want to avenge the blood of the Eastern Palace?

617
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,060
Shi Lan.

618
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,940
Shi Lan.

619
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,540
You've been with your uncle since childhood.

620
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,660
No.

621
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,060
Since that incident,

622
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,140
I've lost my uncle.

623
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,300
I only have my enemies.

624
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,660
I'm so proud of myself

625
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,620
that I can only avenge my family.

626
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,220
But

627
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,500
if we help Ashile Tribe,

628
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,100
we can't turn back.

629
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,220
You're not a warrior.

630
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,500
You'll never turn back.

631
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,260
General.

632
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,980
You're a brave man.

633
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,060
You're a good soldier.

634
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,660
You know the reason why we should

635
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,980
turn back.

636
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,740
When I escaped from Chang'an,

637
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,060
I thought I was lost.

638
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,380
I was in the state of the world.

639
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,420
I planned to return to Youzhou

640
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,340
and Shuozhou to borrow troops.

641
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,820
But I've been through a lot

642
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,100
to realize my mistake.

643
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,940
Behind the war,

644
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,060
there are thousands of people.

645
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,860
They have good intentions.

646
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,740
If we help Ashile Tribe,

647
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,380
the Tang Dynasty

648
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,100
will be in danger.

649
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,340
The world

650
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,540
will be in danger.

651
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,420
The blood will flow.

652
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
The country will be in danger.

653
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,380
General.

654
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,460
Please think twice.

655
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,180
General.

656
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,980
General, why are you doing this?

657
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,260
I was just testing you.

658
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,940
Princess Dadao and the Crown Prince's aunt

659
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,260
appeared in Ashile Tribe's palace.

660
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,700
It's hard to avoid suspicion.

661
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,860
Now it seems that

662
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,780
Princess Yongning is much better than me.

663
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,580
I know my father.

664
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,100
I can't hide my anger

665
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,500
after I die.

666
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
I started the army

667
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,900
to force the people to retreat.

668
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,220
But I failed

669
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,780
in the battle

670
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,500
and failed.

671
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,020
It's because of the lack of supply in Jingzhou

672
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
that Ashile people

673
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,300
took the opportunity to attack Weishui.

674
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,100
I even caused the people to suffer.

675
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,500
I should be blamed for everything.

676
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,900
General, don't blame yourself.

677
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,260
Although Ashile Tribe attacked Weishui,

678
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,460
they were defeated by the enemy.

679
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
But they were defeated by the enemy.

680
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,260
You went to Weishui.

681
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,780
Did you get caught

682
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,740
because you helped Tang?

683
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,460
Hua.

684
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,820
You are really a brave woman.

685
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,620
I...

686
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,060
I thank you

687
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,660
for saving Wanjie.

688
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,180
Yongning, don't worry.

689
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,460
Although I made Li Ximin's rebellion,

690
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,180
I'm still a member of Tang.

691
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,380
No matter what,

692
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,980
I won't be weak.

693
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,580
The most important thing for you

694
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,980
is to take care of yourself.

695
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
I will come to save you.

696
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,140
Besides,

697
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,700
please leave as soon as possible.

698
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,660
After Changge rescues the old general,

699
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,620
I'll contact you

700
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,620
to pick you up.

701
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,540
18th, listen to Yongning.

702
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,340
Go.

703
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,460
You...

704
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
You stubborn woman.

705
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,300
Why don't you listen to me?

706
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,340
18th,

707
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,500
wait for me in private.

708
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,860
You are the only one left.

709
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,900
I've ordered you

710
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,060
to run as far as possible.

711
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,940
But you disobeyed my order

712
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,020
and came here without permission.

713
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,340
Are you going to piss me off?

714
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,420
18th,

715
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,740
go to the mountain and follow the trail.

716
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,020
Have you forgotten it?

717
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:39,980
Go.

718
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,420
Yongning,

719
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,820
Yongning,

720
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,340
go back now.

721
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,780
You are now in the enemy's camp.

722
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,180
You must be careful.

723
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,700
Old General Luo,

724
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,140
this is medicine.

725
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,740
It's useful.

726
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,660
Old General,

727
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,420
take care of yourself.

728
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,660
Wait for Changge to save you.

729
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,900
Thank you, Yongning.

730
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:20,980
Second Princess,

731
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:31,740
why don't you get up the cabbage field to enjoy the autumn walked with me?

732
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,540
Stay there.

733
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,340
Who are you?

734
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:56,420
My heart gradually responds, gradually awakens

735
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:07,420
Gradually swimming towards you, before saying goodbye

736
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:17,420
I'll close your eyes, and lock them into my dream of longing

737
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:26,420
Before dawn, before the years pass, the longing flows

738
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:35,420
There's always a moment that burns down the wastelands in my heart

739
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:46,420
There's always a longing that's between you and me, and it's the reason for everything

740
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:55,420
In each other's world, in different worlds, I'll be the one who's longing for you

741
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:06,420
Like the twinkling of an eye, turning into eternity, the cocoon in the sky

742
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:18,420
There's always a moment that burns down the wastelands in my heart

743
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:29,420
There's always a longing that's between you and me, and it's the reason for everything

744
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:39,420
In each other's world, in different worlds, I'll be the one who's longing for you

745
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:50,420
Like the twinkling of an eye, turning into eternity, the cocoon in the sky
