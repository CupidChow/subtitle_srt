1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,920
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,800
The past is broken

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,960
Still have to fly

4
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,440
Follow the light to find the direction

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Tell you to tree

6
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,600
Memories of the past

7
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,440
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Episode 16

9
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
My grandson.

10
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
My grandson.

11
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
It seems that the medicine is not enough.

12
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,440
From today on, increase the amount of medicine.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Yes.

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Let the people who went to Mobei

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
go and investigate it again.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
They must see the body of Ashile Sun with their own eyes.

17
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Even the purple grass is not destroyed.

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
I don't believe

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
that he will kill Sun himself.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
I will definitely do it well.

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
By the way,

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I heard that Bu Zhen and that King Sui have a good relationship.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
They are the same age.

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
King Sui likes them very much.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,440
As long as we still have people,

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
this chess piece will still be useful.

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Little Khan.

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I have confirmed that the Bear Division and Eagle Division

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
will be out of Mu Jin in two days.

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
The one who is not alive will come back.

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Why?

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Ashile Sun has been in the battlefield for a long time.

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
What kind of wind has never seen?

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
How could it be?

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Sun.

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I haven't had a good drink with you yet.

38
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,440
I thought you would be happy when you died.

39
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Why can't I be happy now?

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
You are my best opponent.

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
I haven't proven to you that I won't lose to you.

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Ashile Sun, you bastard.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
You want me to lose to you forever.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
I have to go.

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
I have to go.

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I have to go.

47
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I have to go.

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
When I was alive, I was so hateful.

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
I feel so bad when I die.

50
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I will never forget you.

51
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
I will never forget you.

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Do you believe that Ashile Sun is dead?

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
He started the battle on the grasslands.

54
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Sher, you are drunk.

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,440
It must be Shuhan.

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,440
How could Tu Kashe dare to fight without his help?

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
How dare he?

58
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Who dares to fight against Ashile Sun?

59
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I can't imagine that

60
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
the war on the desert

61
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
will be fought by the people of the desert

62
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
and Tu Kashe.

63
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
They all want Ashile Sun's life.

64
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Everyone has their own fate.

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Don't make any wild guesses.

66
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Those words of yours

67
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
are heard by those who are thoughtful.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
If you hear them,

69
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
you will be angry when you feel cold.

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
It's not good for the Wolf Division.

71
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Angry?

72
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Ashile Sun is dead.

73
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Why don't you tell me the truth?

74
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
I wanted to win Ashile Sun before.

75
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Now the Eagle Division is gone.

76
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Sher,

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,440
even if you become the king of the grasslands,

78
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
what's the point?

79
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Of course it's meaningful.

80
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
You are the real king of Ashile Tribe.

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
You should have ordered the grasslands.

82
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Ashile Sun is dead.

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
You should be happy.

84
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
You can't let him down.

85
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Sher.

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Sher.

87
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Sher.

88
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Sher.

89
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Sher.

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Sher.

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Ashile Sun.

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,600
Where is he?

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,640
Did you catch him?

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,760
He's dead.

95
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,200
Who let him go?

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
Our men surrounded him.

97
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,960
He couldn't escape,

98
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,920
so he committed suicide.

99
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Where is his body?

100
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,320
He was found outside.

101
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,840
He searched the whole body.

102
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,680
He left nothing valuable.

103
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,520
Ashile Tribe's men

104
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,720
wanted to kill them.

105
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,440
They wanted to kill Ashile Village.

106
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,280
Shen A'zheng.

107
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,400
If they dare to hurt Sun Yi Fen again,

108
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll pay you back ten times.

109
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,960
I want to ask you for one more favor.

110
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,200
Go ahead.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,840
Since they sent the spy,

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
it must be a matter of death.

113
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,160
Can you burn the battlefield

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,240
and destroy the city?

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
You can still be so thoughtful

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,080
in the midst of sorrow.

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Good.

118
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,480
Don't worry.

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Leave it to me.

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,120
How is it?

121
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,360
I've done what I should do.

122
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,480
But

123
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
can you wait till tomorrow

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,480
to prepare yourself?

125
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,920
Thank you.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,560
I'll take good care of him.

127
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,120
Let's go.

128
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,960
Sun.

129
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,320
Can you hear me?

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I've asked the Bodhisattva

131
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,640
to arrange a temporary brother.

132
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,640
When you wake up,

133
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,760
we'll leave together.

134
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
We'll go to

135
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,640
a place where we never fight.

136
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,000
The water is so fresh there.

137
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,000
The city is so beautiful.

138
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,600
I heard that it's a little north.

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I heard that it's a little north.

140
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
There's a very beautiful snow mountain.

141
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,840
Can you go with me?

142
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,760
I remember when we were born,

143
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,800
I lost all my family members

144
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,920
when we were born.

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,320
But I became friends with

146
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,800
a rare A'Zhun.

147
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,520
My surname is Qin.

148
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
My name is A'Zhun.

149
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,560
You can call me A'Zhun.

150
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,640
Whether it's thunder or lightning,

151
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,240
or sword and sword,

152
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,400
I'll use Ashile Sun to block it.

153
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,360
That was the darkest moment in my life.

154
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
But you appeared.

155
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
Now is the darkest moment for you.

156
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,520
I will never leave you.

157
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
We've walked through

158
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,200
so many lives together.

159
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,400
We can walk together in the future.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,800
Right?

161
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,000
I really hate you.

162
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
You're so arrogant

163
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,800
and you're so rich.

164
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,960
You don't take care of yourself.

165
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,840
But I can't leave you.

166
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
You always tell me

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,120
that I'll pay off my debt

168
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,360
with my whole life.

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,000
I, Li Changge, promise you

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
that I'll never leave you.

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,160
I'll never leave you.

172
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,560
I promise you

173
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
that I'll never leave you.

174
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,640
But you have to give me a chance.

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
Wake up.

176
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,720
A'Zhun.

177
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,240
Wake up, okay?

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm here with you.

179
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,760
Wake up.

180
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,080
We have a lot to do.

181
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,320
We have a lot to do.

182
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,200
Don't leave me.

183
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,080
I didn't expect

184
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
that things would develop like this.

185
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,840
Suo and Changge

186
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
are probably the reason

187
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
why things happened in Mobei.

188
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,320
You should go to meet them first.

189
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
Ying Shi is gone.

190
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm afraid it's not safe

191
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,520
for you to stay here.

192
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,760
What about you?

193
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
Why are you staying here?

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,000
My brother is sick.

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,680
He needs to move to another place.

196
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
I've asked around.

197
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,880
He needs to move to Dingxiang.

198
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
I have to go with him.

199
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,080
I have something

200
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,320
that I haven't done yet.

201
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,920
What is it?

202
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,520
Since we're all

203
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,560
on the same boat now,

204
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
our brothers of the Yanxing Sect

205
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,560
won't leave you alone.

206
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,760
It's not convenient for you to follow us.

207
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,320
Please

208
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,000
tell Suo all these news.

209
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,000
And

210
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
Yaro is dead.

211
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
I went to the cellar of the tent secretly.

212
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,720
I found that there was no Yaro.

213
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,440
The guards in the cellar told me

214
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
that Yaro was killed

215
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,120
on the night of the tent.

216
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
Now the tent

217
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,640
is no longer the same as before.

218
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,600
The tent is now a tent.

219
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,960
You said the tent was going to be moved to Dingxiang.

220
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
Then the people in Ashile Tribe

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,000
who are following us

222
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,760
are Khatun.

223
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,360
Interesting.

224
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't want to interfere

225
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,760
in the affairs of Ashile Tribe.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,960
I only follow

227
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,960
the arrangement of our Young Master.

228
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,880
Thank you, Master.

229
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,440
You must be more careful in the future.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,520
In addition,

231
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
if you meet Mimi,

232
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,360
tell her

233
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,520
to live well.

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,120
Young man,

235
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,560
I think

236
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,320
she must want you to tell her in person.

237
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,680
Xu Fang,

238
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,280
tell the brothers

239
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
that we are waiting for the instructions

240
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,240
from Young Master here.

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,080
In addition,

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,280
send a letter to Mobei first.

243
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes.

244
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,680
Young man,

245
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,640
you must take care of yourself.

246
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
Thank you, my brother.

247
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,080
I'll meet you later.

248
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
Good-bye.

249
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,160
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Sun,

251
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,360
you're awake.

252
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,160
You're really awake.

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,040
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

254
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,360
You're really awake.

255
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,200
Are you

256
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,240
really not going to leave me again?

257
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,440
You heard it all.

258
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm worth it

259
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
to hear your sincere words.

260
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,040
What are you talking about?

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Do you know how worried I was last night?

262
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,360
I was afraid you'd really...

263
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,200
die.

264
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
I thought I would die too.

265
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,640
But when I heard your name,

266
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,360
I came back from the Sky Hall.

267
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,640
I also heard

268
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
you wanted to avenge me.

269
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,760
I was really happy.

270
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,080
Changge,

271
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
I didn't think about anything

272
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,560
when I was in the middle.

273
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
I just wanted to take you home.

274
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,680
Changge, I...

275
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,080
Sun Teqi, you're awake.

276
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,080
If you don't have Sun Teqi anymore,

277
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,760
just call me Sun.

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,000
How about this?

279
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,640
I'll go tell them first.

280
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,360
Everyone has been worried for the whole night.

281
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,800
Good. Good.

282
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,960
Good.

283
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,360
Go catch them!

284
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,600
Are you good?

285
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,240
Hurry and stay here!

286
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,560
There's more over there!

287
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,320
Stay still!

288
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,560
Shut up if you're so noisy!

289
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,440
Kyuhang.

290
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
What's going on?

291
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,160
He has given the order

292
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,360
We'll set it up tomorrow.

293
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,360
We'll start it today.

294
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
You're seriously ill.

295
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,080
You can't stay here any longer.

296
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,520
You'll be in charge of

297
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
the whole grassland

298
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,160
and the dam.

299
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
You're the real king of Ashile Tribe.

300
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,760
You should have ordered the grassland.

301
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,560
It's Anna.

302
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,880
Shu Han is ill.

303
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,560
Ashile Sun and Tu Kaishou are dead.

304
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
I'm the only one left in the heaven.

305
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
It's a coincidence.

306
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,320
It's Anna's plan.

307
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
Tu Lehe, what do you think?

308
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,240
It's a good thing

309
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
that you two can reunite.

310
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,840
What's the matter?

311
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
The scout we sent to Mobei

312
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,320
is dead.

313
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,480
Dead?

314
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,480
Mobei soldiers must have found him.

315
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,240
They're all useless.

316
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,440
So,

317
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,160
no one saw Ashile Sun dead?

318
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,320
Yes.

319
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,680
Besides,

320
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,560
Tu Kaishou's body was missing.

321
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,400
Mobei soldiers

322
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,040
defeated Ashile Tribe for the first time.

323
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,760
They used the war field to generate the morale.

324
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,920
So...

325
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,360
I see.

326
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,480
You may leave.

327
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,240
Yes.

328
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,040
The Wolf of Grassland

329
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,640
What did I say?

330
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,640
The wolf of grassland has nine lives.

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
He won't die so easily.

332
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,200
To be honest,

333
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,480
I know you're a tough man

334
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,240
because Ashile Sun is dead.

335
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,240
I won't argue with you.

336
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Ashile Tribe sent the people

337
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
who killed you.

338
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,920
There's nothing to be worried about.

339
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
As long as you surrender with Eagle Division,

340
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
I can promise you

341
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,160
that I, Mobei,

342
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,680
won't treat you badly.

343
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Thank you for your kindness.

344
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,160
But I took Eagle Division to kill him

345
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,840
not to kill my brothers

346
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,800
in another place.

347
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,360
Where else can you go

348
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,720
except Mobei?

349
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,680
Anywhere is fine.

350
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
Even if we're released,

351
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,080
it's better than

352
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,880
a bloody battle.

353
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
You're a soldier.

354
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,960
You don't have to be so polite.

355
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,680
Otherwise, we...

356
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,440
Eagle Division

357
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,280
won't be a weapon in anyone's hand.

358
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
Since everyone has said it,

359
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,640
I want to say something, too.

360
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,200
Go ahead.

361
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,160
I think Li Kehan

362
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,720
won't kill Ashile Sun

363
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,480
even if he's afraid of Eagle Division.

364
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Behind this...

365
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,280
Dingxiang.

366
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,360
It must have something to do with Dingxiang.

367
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
You also thought of it?

368
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,880
Yes.

369
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
Even if Father has the chance to trick me,

370
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,360
he won't give up the knife.

371
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,880
But if it's that man,

372
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm afraid

373
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,960
he knows better than anyone

374
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
about Eagle Division.

375
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,440
Eagle Division can't be used for him.

376
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
Now the tribes of the desert are rebelling.

377
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
Princess Yicheng's plan

378
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,720
is out of control.

379
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,080
But I think she won't give up.

380
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm afraid

381
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,720
more Ashile Tribe people

382
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,640
will be bewitched by her

383
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,600
and fight in the desert.

384
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,720
Now, if we want to have a peaceful life,

385
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,120
there's only one way to choose.

386
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
To ally with Tang.

387
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,080
To ally with Tang?

388
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,600
To ally with Tang

389
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
and let the third party get involved in this.

390
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,680
Then,

391
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,640
if Yicheng wants to start a war again,

392
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,520
he'll think twice.

393
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
What if it doesn't stop?

394
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,640
I can't just watch Tang

395
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,720
attack Ashile Tribe.

396
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,880
I don't want to see

397
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
such a thing happen.

398
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,240
But we have to do our best.

399
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,240
Only if we let the three sides fight,

400
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,840
we can't win this battle.

401
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,080
Changge.

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,080
You're thinking too simply.

403
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,720
It's not an easy thing to do.

404
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,760
But if we don't do our best,

405
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,960
there won't be any hope.

406
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,000
This is a letter from Mr. Qin this morning.

407
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,960
There's a tombstone inside.

408
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
It's a message from him.

409
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yaro is dead.

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
Fuhai is also seriously ill.

411
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,560
The tent...

412
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
The tent is going to Dingxiang.

413
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Yes.

414
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,920
If I'm right,

415
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,360
Yicheng is controlling the king's court.

416
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,400
The tent is going to Dingxiang.

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
Once Yicheng completely controls

418
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,240
the whole Ashile Tribe,

419
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,120
the next step he takes

420
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
will be to attack Tang.

421
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,280
That means

422
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,640
you came to us for Tang.

423
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,760
No.

424
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,040
I came for the innocent people

425
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,840
who suffered from war.

426
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
Whether it's the whole desert,

427
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,080
Ashile Tribe,

428
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
or Tang,

429
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,840
these innocent people

430
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
shouldn't be sacrificed

431
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
by these people's conspiracy and desire.

432
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,960
None of us can survive.

433
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,240
I thought you had some big plan

434
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,280
to ally with Tang.

435
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,480
Don't forget.

436
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
We were all enemies of Tang.

437
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,440
Yes.

438
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Who can guarantee

439
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
that Tang will be the second Ashile Tribe?

440
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,240
No.

441
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Only Tang can solve this crisis.

442
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,480
As far as I know,

443
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,080
Tang will never be the second Ashile Tribe.

444
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,440
Let Tang take control of Ashile Tribe.

445
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,680
Then,

446
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,240
the desert will be safe.

447
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,200
It's not cheaper than this.

448
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,280
Besides,

449
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,040
you want to fight against Ashile Tribe

450
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
and take the risk.

451
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,240
How can you give up

452
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,640
such a powerful ally?

453
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
Wait.

454
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,840
We've been discussing for a long time.

455
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,000
I have a question.

456
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,960
Why should Tang ally with us?

457
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
In a few days,

458
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,040
we'll have news.

459
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,840
Sun.

460
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,040
Yaro...

461
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,080
Yaro sacrificed himself for the whole Eagle Division.

462
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
Don't blame yourself too much.

463
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Changge.

464
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
Father won't kill Yaro.

465
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,120
I know.

466
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,320
I know.

467
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
But I don't want to kill him.

468
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,920
I don't want to kill him.

469
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,640
I don't want to kill him.

470
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
I don't want to kill him.

471
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
I don't want to kill him.

472
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I don't want to kill him.

473
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,880
I know.

474
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,040
Father is strong as a bird.

475
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,320
He won't die easily.

476
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,680
Sun.

477
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,840
I know.

478
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,880
If you don't care about the overall situation...

479
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,560
If you don't care about the overall situation,

480
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,720
you'll take the whole Eagle Division to the desert

481
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,760
to avenge Yaro

482
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
and save your father.

483
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,480
Yes.

484
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,120
As the special envoy of Eagle Division,

485
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
I failed to protect Yaro.

486
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,920
As his son,

487
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,000
I shouldn't let Yicheng hurt Father.

488
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,320
I know we're all waiting for a chance.

489
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,960
But don't worry.

490
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,360
Yicheng will never hurt Great Khan's life.

491
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
After all, the whole Ashile Tribe

492
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,880
needs him to lead the army.

493
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm very confused now.

494
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,360
Don't be.

495
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm here.

496
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,240
Sun.

497
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,080
I'll go with you

498
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
to save your father

499
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,440
and avenge Yaro and the whole Eagle Division.

500
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,080
Chief.

501
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,360
The envoy of Great Tang wants to see you.

502
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,560
I know.

503
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,400
Leave.

504
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,080
Yes.

505
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Great Tang?

506
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
So fast.

507
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,920
Li Changge is not that simple.

508
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,760
I'll meet this envoy.

509
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,280
Are you here

510
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,680
or are you hiding?

511
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,600
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

512
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
Summon the envoy of Great Tang.

513
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,960
Yes.

514
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,880
Yes.

515
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,480
Yes.

516
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes.

517
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,560
Yes.

518
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,080
Yes.

519
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,600
Yes.

520
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,200
Yes.

521
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,840
Yes.

522
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,200
King Mobei.

523
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
I'm Wei Shuyu, the envoy of Great Tang.

524
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,360
The court has recently found out

525
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,960
that Ashile Tribe is recruiting troops in the desert.

526
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,960
His Majesty ordered us to come

527
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,480
and invite the leaders of the desert

528
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,760
to go to Chang'an

529
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,120
to discuss the alliance.

530
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Thank you for coming here.

531
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
We'll discuss it

532
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,760
in detail.

533
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,840
Yes.

534
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,560
Changge.

535
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,040
Wei Shuyu.

536
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,080
Why are you here?

537
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,280
Changge.

538
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,720
Why are you here in Mobei?

539
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,800
Since Liuyun Temple was abandoned,

540
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
both I and Liuyun are worried about you.

541
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,560
What about Liuyun?

542
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,480
How is Liuyun?

543
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Her Highness is very good.

544
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,120
She personally checked the farm

545
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,080
and approached the people.

546
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,560
She's different from before.

547
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,040
After all, she has suffered

548
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,680
so much on her way here.

549
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,600
But it's a good thing.

550
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,560
After all, the princess of Great Tang

551
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,640
is going to grow up.

552
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,640
You are also the princess of Great Tang.

553
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,920
You have grown up.

554
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,880
Shuyu.

555
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,720
Tell me about Li Shini.

556
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,400
Tell me

557
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
why you came here this time.

558
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Her Majesty received a secret letter.

559
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,280
After reading the secret letter,

560
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,320
she ordered me to make a move

561
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,760
to hurt the alliance.

562
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,160
The secret letter

563
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,880
was written in the name of Shu Zhou.

564
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,280
Changge.

565
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,440
Is it you?

566
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,400
It's me.

567
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,960
I didn't expect

568
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,800
you to be so fond of Great Tang.

569
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
After all, Great Tang

570
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,840
is my hometown.

571
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,320
She is your friend.

572
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,760
Yes.

573
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,200
She is my friend, Sun.

574
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,160
Sun, come here.

575
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,280
Let me introduce you

576
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
my friend in Great Tang,

577
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,000
Wei Shuyu.

578
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,080
Your friend

579
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
doesn't seem to like me.

580
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,840
That's her personality.

581
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't mind it.

582
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,640
It doesn't matter.

583
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,680
This brother of Sun,

584
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,080
Sun,

585
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,840
Sun.

586
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,320
He is Ashile Sun.

587
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,880
Yes.

588
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,880
He is Ashile Sun of Eagle Division.

589
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,000
I received a secret letter.

590
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,440
Eagle Division and Bear Division are on the north of the camp.

591
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,600
The whole army is dead.

592
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,960
How can he still be alive?

593
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
It's a long story.

594
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
Sun is still alive.

595
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,000
Please help us to cover it up.

596
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,760
The alliance is in danger.

597
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,120
We don't want to cause more trouble.

598
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I can agree to that.

599
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,960
But Changge,

600
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,120
if you think I'm your friend,

601
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,200
just listen to me.

602
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,520
He is not a kind person.

603
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,800
You'd better stay away from him.

604
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,400
Wei Shuyu,

605
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,080
I know you are doing this for my own good.

606
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,840
But I know what I should do.

607
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Don't worry.

608
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
In that case,

609
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,640
it's useless to say more.

610
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,400
Changge,

611
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,800
I have work to do.

612
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,320
I'll go ahead.

613
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,280
One week later

614
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,440
I think

615
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,920
you must have a lotener concerns

616
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,080
that I have seen the centurer today.

617
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,240
You can say it yourself.

618
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
I was once the east palace of Tang.

619
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,760
The current emperor killed my family.

620
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,360
I fled all the way

621
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,720
and met Ashile Sun.

622
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,440
I became friends with him.

623
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,160
So,

624
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm not only the old envoy of Wei,

625
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,960
but also the military adviser of the Eagle Division.

626
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,160
Interesting.

627
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,400
Then Tang won't kill you now?

628
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,720
Otherwise,

629
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,080
how can I meet you two now?

630
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,440
I believe you.

631
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,680
The desert can't lose a strong ally.

632
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,880
A strong ally.

633
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,360
But,

634
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,200
who should I send to Chang'an?

635
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,680
I want to know your opinion.

636
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,720
If you believe me,

637
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,760
I'm willing to go to Chang'an

638
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,040
for Mobei.

639
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,200
You?

640
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
I went to the alliance with other tribes before.

641
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,760
So, there must be some trust between us.

642
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,400
Please rest assured, Commander.

643
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,120
I'll fight for the desert.

644
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,280
You're not a member of the desert.

645
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,640
Why are you so sad about the alliance?

646
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,920
I hope to end the war as soon as possible.

647
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,840
No matter it's the Central Plains,

648
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,560
the grasslands or the desert,

649
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
I won't suffer from starvation again.

650
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,960
That's all?

651
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,320
Isn't that enough?

652
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,480
What identity do you want?

653
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,280
Whatever I choose.

654
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Let me hear it.

655
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I want to be the princess of Mobei.

656
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,720
I want to be the princess of Mobei.

657
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm your sister.

658
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,640
What do you think?

659
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,800
Okay.

660
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,280
Thank you, Commander.

661
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,080
From the time you were my sister-in-law,

662
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,400
until now,

663
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,000
everything seems to be in your expectation.

664
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,760
You're my friend, not my enemy.

665
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,560
Tan!

666
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Tan!

667
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,960
I want to go to Chang'an, too.

668
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,680
Even the fake princess Changge can go.

669
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,400
Why can't I go?

670
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,280
You're eavesdropping on me again.

671
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,520
I... I just passed by.

672
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
Then I heard Changge say

673
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,480
that she wanted to be the princess.

674
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,000
Tan!

675
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,600
No! No!

676
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm very much in love with Chang'an.

677
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,240
No!

678
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,960
Tan!

679
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,360
It's a rare opportunity.

680
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,680
If I had such a heartless daughter,

681
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,040
I would have sent her far away.

682
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,200
You!

683
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
Since you're so active,

684
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,160
if you don't let her go,

685
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,840
she will try to follow you.

686
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,920
Why don't you go with me?

687
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
It's easy for you to say.

688
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,600
What if something happens to my precious daughter?

689
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,080
Brother Chang and Brother Sun are here.

690
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,520
If anything happens to me,

691
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,760
you can ask Changge.

692
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
Tan!

693
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,280
Listen to me.

694
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,000
Tu Jiake is my only dear.

695
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,800
I know. I know.

696
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,160
Changge will protect me, right?

697
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,120
Please be careful when you go to Chang'an.

698
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,560
Don't be hasty.

699
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,320
I won't let you down.

700
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
I'll see you off.

701
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,200
Take care.

702
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,600
Brother Sun, Brother Sun, have you been to Chang'an?

703
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,240
This is my first time in Chang'an.

704
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,520
I heard that Chang'an is big and beautiful.

705
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
There are many delicious food there.

706
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,880
It's hard to predict what will happen in Chang'an.

707
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,520
Are you ready?

708
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,240
Master Liu Yun Guan told me

709
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,280
that if I go there without any problems,

710
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I will be able to cope with the consequences.

711
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,160
If I just go there to avoid the disaster

712
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
and leave with a straight face,

713
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,200
I won't be the Li Changge I am today.

714
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,480
There are many ways ahead.

715
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
There is no regret.

716
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Besides, Sun Ni is still here.

717
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,400
You're right.

718
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,520
Let's go.

719
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,040
I'll go get some people to help.

720
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,800
Okay.

721
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Let's go.

722
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,920
Come on.

723
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,060
Nice.

724
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,480
Everybody who entered

725
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,440
must not be allowed to Be in the area.

726
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
I'm afraid I can't eat it.

727
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,360
Don't worry, Ketun.

728
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,280
I won't disappoint you.

729
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,680
The Crown Prince

730
00:35:45,800 --> 00:36:10,700
A

731
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,040
Mo Beimuo has sent an envoy

732
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
to the north of Chang'an.

733
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,440
Li Changge is the leader

734
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,520
of the army.

735
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,600
Li Changge

736
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
can get

737
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
into trouble at any time.

738
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,680
We've left many people in Chang'an

739
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,520
to serve you for the rest of our lives.

740
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,360
Kill them?

741
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
The alliance between Tang and the desert

742
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
is a big deal.

743
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,080
Just killing Li Changge

744
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,200
is useless.

745
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,600
You mean...

746
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,840
Since the desert wants to ally with Li Tang,

747
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,960
I should

748
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,280
share the goodwill of the two states.

749
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,440
Your Highness, please don't.

750
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,760
I know what you're worried about.

751
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,640
But I'm no longer

752
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,720
the little girl

753
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
who only cries in the carriage.

754
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,360
I'm looking forward

755
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,560
to Chang'an.

756
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,040
Since Your Highness wants to go,

757
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,280
I'll go with you.

758
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,320
No.

759
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
I want you to

760
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,760
stay with me.

761
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,680
When did you start following me?

762
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,520
When we were in the Daxing Palace

763
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,320
or when I got married?

764
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,760
I was in the open for 18 years.

765
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,960
I'm the guard of the Daxing Palace.

766
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,640
You came to the grassland with me

767
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,680
in the second year.

768
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,440
I married four husbands.

769
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,360
But in the end,

770
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,680
you were always

771
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,480
by my side.

772
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,560
In other words,

773
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,360
I was always with you.

774
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,640
You're the only one

775
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,960
I can trust

776
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,720
in the vast grassland.

777
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
I'll watch the Gu Dingxiang City

778
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,680
for Your Highness.

779
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,560
Gu Dingxiang City

780
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,920
You're here.

781
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,280
I cooked something for you.

782
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,760
Anna.

783
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,240
What's wrong?

784
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,920
Can't you sleep?

785
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,080
Do you miss the grassland?

786
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,120
It's so late.

787
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,440
You should rest early too.

788
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Wait.

789
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,480
I want to talk to you.

790
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,840
Try it.

791
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
I know

792
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,000
you have many doubts in your heart.

793
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,880
You also think that

794
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,840
something happened too suddenly.

795
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,160
I just want to ask you.

796
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,760
Have you ever thought about

797
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,840
breaking the shackles of Shu Han

798
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,760
and seeing Anna every day?

799
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,920
Yes.

800
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,480
I was hurt every time when I was young.

801
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,880
I was punished.

802
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,360
I wanted to seek comfort in Anna's tent.

803
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,160
But I didn't dare.

804
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,640
I couldn't.

805
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,240
I could only be alone

806
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,320
and hurt by the gods.

807
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,280
Anna.

808
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
I'm not used to it.

809
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,560
I understand.

810
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,400
You've grown up alone

811
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,720
all these years.

812
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,880
You're used to

813
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,840
having no Anna.

814
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,000
No.

815
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
Now we're finally reunited.

816
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,640
Are you happy?

817
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,920
Yes.

818
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Dingxiang is my hometown.

819
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,120
I have so many memories of Anna here.

820
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,080
I also have many regrets.

821
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,720
I hope I can make up for it

822
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,080
as much as possible.

823
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
Will you stay by my side?

824
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Everything I do

825
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,960
is for you.

826
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
I know.

827
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,720
All right.

828
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,000
You should rest early.

829
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,200
Anna should go back.

830
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,440
I'm going to Chang'an.

831
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,720
Chang'an?

832
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,800
Why are you going to Chang'an?

833
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,320
To do something I haven't done.

834
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,000
Anna.

835
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,840
I'll go with you.

836
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,880
What they want is not public.

837
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,260
If you want to stop it,

838
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,300
I won't.

839
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,900
Wait for me.

840
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,160
That's it.

841
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,360
Bye.

842
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:54,900
נהn.

843
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,280
Stop!

844
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
It's much more fun than Mo Nan and Mo Bei.

845
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Brother Sun, Brother Cheng,

846
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
I'm going to buy something.

847
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
Little lady, look at the other person.

848
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:20,940
I...

849
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Two coins each.

850
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
I'm back.

851
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Things are not as they should be.

852
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
In the past, it can only be used to recall.

853
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Mother, are you okay?

854
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
I've broken your heart again.

855
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
I've wronged you.

856
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
It's okay.

857
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
I'm just a little touched.

858
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
When things are over,

859
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
I'll take you away.

860
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
This time I'm back,

861
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
I really feel like I'm in a different world.

862
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,440
This world is really hard to deal with.

863
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
I tried my best to escape.

864
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,440
Now I'm back without any care.

865
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Sun,

866
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
do you think people change easily?

867
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
I escaped for my own life.

868
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Now I'm back

869
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,440
for more people's lives.

870
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Brother Cheng,

871
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
you didn't do anything wrong.

872
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
If the sky is clear,

873
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
the sky is clear.

874
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
If the world is full of life and death,

875
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
and war and war,

876
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
how can I live alone?

877
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Saving others

878
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
is also saving myself.

879
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
Don't worry.

880
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I'll protect you.

881
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I'm the Princess of Mobei now.

882
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Who dares to harm me?

883
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
That's right.

884
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
With a guard like me,

885
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm afraid the person who made you suffer

886
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
will be gone.

887
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Your voice

889
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,440
is locked in my tender dream.

890
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Before dawn,

891
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
before the years pass,

892
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,440
the longing flows.

893
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,440
There's always a moment

894
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,440
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

895
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,440
There's always a longing

896
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,440
that meets you and me.

897
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
In different worlds,

898
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
in different worlds,

899
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,440
I'll be your sword

900
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
in the four seasons.

901
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
The sword that cuts through the dark night

902
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:25,440
becomes the sword in the dark night.

903
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,440
There's always a moment

904
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,440
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

905
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
There's always a longing

906
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,440
that meets you and me.

907
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
In different worlds,

908
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,440
in different worlds,

909
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
I'll be your sword

910
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
in the four seasons.

911
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,440
The sword that cuts through the dark night

912
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,440
becomes the sword in the dark night.

913
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
The sword that cuts through the dark night

914
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,440
becomes the sword in the dark night.
