We Na π

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm willing to give up.

15
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,160
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

16
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240
What do you know?

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,440
I just...

18
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,040
I just envy him.

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,720
You fought for him.

20
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,680
It's worth it.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Cheers.

22
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,400
Why are you laughing?

23
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,360
I was

24
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
drinking with Changge.

25
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
Then we became brothers.

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,640
Brothers?

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
You're from the prairie.

28
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
You're even a brother to Commandant Li.

29
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
Can't I?

30
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,720
You're interesting.

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
Come on, let's drink.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
You don't want to drink?

33
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,160
Tell them to clean up.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,000
Or the shop will be in a panic.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Let's drink.

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,640
Here.

37
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,240
Put it here.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,880
Okay.

39
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Come with me.

40
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,200
Your Highness.

41
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,640
Wei Lang Jun, you're here.

42
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,720
Look.

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
It's so beautiful.

44
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,080
This shop

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
is designed for this purpose.

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,800
If it's lit up like this,

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it will be able to compete with

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,480
all the palaces in Chang'an.

49
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
Your Highness,

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,440
it's over.

51
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,680
How can you do such a ridiculous thing?

52
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,440
Right.

53
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,720
And Xiao Jin.

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,280
Is there no light

55
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
on this main road?

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,160
Your Highness,

57
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,240
Xiao Jin's strategy has always been wrong.

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,160
You must not be caught

59
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
by others when you're in Luoyang.

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
If you don't say it,

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
who will know?

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Did Father win the game?

63
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,720
How can he see this?

64
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
Have you ever thought

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,960
how many people in the Purple Garden

66
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,400
can see this kind of light?

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
It's not just me.

68
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Your Highness, you want His Majesty

69
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
to receive as many documents as possible.

70
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
Enough. Enough.

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
As long as you don't tell Gu Xiao Zhuang,

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
who will care about this?

73
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Xiao Jin.

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,840
Other places in Luoyang are closed.

75
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Besides, Gu Che also lit the lamp

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,840
to pray for the refugees.

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
This is the Purple Garden.

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,000
It will be Luoyang's

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
night-time palace from now on.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,520
Your Highness.

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Have a seat.

82
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Please.

83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Your Highness,

84
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,080
what is it?

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Your Highness.

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,240
Wei pi.

87
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,200
Do you know

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,360
who Miss Jiang is ?

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
Please tell me you know.

90
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,560
Is she Po Man's wife?

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
She used to ask sign a statement

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,080
to get Xue Rong's signature.

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
How could she know?

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
Well,

95
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,840
if you don't,

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
you're both dead to me.

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,320
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
I won't ask you about it.

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,680
I'll come back as soon as possible.

100
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
Your Highness. Your Highness.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
Do as I said.

102
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,600
Are you going to South Hill again?

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,040
Mr. Hao.

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,040
Her Highness wants you to go to the imperial room with her.

105
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
She has been in Luoyang for a long time.

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
She has been busy with the Crown Prince.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
She hasn't been out much.

108
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,160
Aren't you going out?

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,520
Let's go.

110
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Go.

111
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
He always says he wants to buy a child.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
You like him so much.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,880
The news of Young Master has been spread in Luoyang.

114
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,960
Mr. Qin is sad.

115
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,760
He knows that you are a child.

116
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,160
Is it you who plays with him

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,000
or you are teasing him?

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,640
I really can't tell you.

119
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,760
You are so mean.

120
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,360
Who are you talking about?

121
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,240
Are you jealous?

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm not.

123
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,160
You have to fight again.

124
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Good.

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,160
Come on.

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Good.

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,520
I want to go over there.

128
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,440
Okay.

129
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,240
Good.

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Good.

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
Come on.

132
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,200
Good.

133
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Don't walk around.

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,720
It's dangerous.

135
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,800
I want to see that.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Trying to magnetize the

137
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,640
chance of suicide

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,040
comes again...

139
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,480
Don't be designated!

140
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,160
I just wanted some free time,

141
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,360
and for the love of my life,

142
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
I followed the book of talking to the previous language classes.

143
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
Your life is going on!

144
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
Give me some.

145
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,760
Give me some.

146
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,440
Hao Du.

147
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,120
Look at this store.

148
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,400
There are so many people.

149
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,880
It must be delicious.

150
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
There are too many people.

151
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
I can't squeeze in.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Why don't you buy some for me?

153
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay.

154
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
Then you stay here.

155
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,040
Don't run around.

156
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,040
Wait.

157
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,240
Buy some with this.

158
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I still have some money.

159
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,200
Your Highness.

160
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,600
Hurry up.

161
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Is there any?

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,440
Give me some.

163
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
What do you want?

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,680
Sweet.

165
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,760
Excuse me.

166
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,680
Excuse me.

167
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,720
Let's go.

168
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,360
Brother Chang.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,680
There are so many people here.

170
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Let's find another place.

171
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,040
Leng Yan.

172
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
You've changed.

173
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,640
If you want to change,

174
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
how dare you come out like this?

175
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,240
You always make fun of me.

176
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,360
I didn't make fun of you.

177
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,240
I'm happy for you.

178
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,280
You used to

179
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,200
like to hide behind people

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,520
and be afraid of being protected.

181
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,240
But now you're not like that.

182
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,520
I found what I want to do.

183
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,240
I want to be the princess of Tang.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
The real princess.

185
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,280
I don't want to see the people suffer from hunger.

186
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,200
I don't want to see the children without food.

187
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
I want to be like you.

188
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,520
I want to be a woman who is above all.

189
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,160
Leng Yan.

190
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
You've really changed.

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
Someone once told me

192
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm a man.

193
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,360
I can walk around.

194
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
But I'm a woman.

195
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,120
I can do the same.

196
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
So whether you like

197
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,640
the little rabbit Li Leyan

198
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,000
or the princess of Tang,

199
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,520
you can do

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,160
whatever you want.

201
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,320
Don't push.

202
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,280
Don't push.

203
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,920
Don't push.

204
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,520
Don't push.

205
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,480
Don't push.

206
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,120
Your Highness.

207
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,360
Leyan.

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I've been through

209
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
a lot on my way.

210
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,960
I always thought

211
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
after I met you,

212
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,840
I must cry for you.

213
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,880
But now I remember

214
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,360
it's not a big deal.

215
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,320
Yes.

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,760
We've grown up.

217
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,000
Changge.

218
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Where do you live?

219
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
How can I find you in the future?

220
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
I live in Liuyun Temple.

221
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,720
But you don't have to find me.

222
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,480
I'll come to South Hill sometimes.

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
That means

224
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,360
we can meet again.

225
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,600
By the way, Changge.

226
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,560
Hao Du is in the city recently.

227
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,640
You must be careful on your way.

228
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,800
He'll catch you

229
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,960
if he sees you.

230
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,120
Hao... Hao Du.

231
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,320
Changge.

232
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,400
I have to go.

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,720
Be careful.

234
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Zixuan Temple

235
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,920
Look carefully.

236
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,320
This is...

237
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,080
tuijing

238
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,580
i felt like you

239
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,280
are the key

240
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,440
to my happiness

241
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,720
I

242
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,740
can only see

243
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,360
sweet-soup

244
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,240
After I bit myhappy, I went to the market

245
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,860
I didn't mean nor did I boyfriend

246
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,060
I am sorry

247
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,900
next time

248
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,340
I will give to you

249
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,140
Love ind Anti-걱

250
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,580
If you love,

251
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,180
Then bet you pay up a lifetime to let go

252
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,980
Why ask for love?

253
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,280
How can I break up with s00t

254
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm not afraid of being bureau bara

255
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,380
I thought I lost you

256
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800
No, I didn't

257
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,380
I...

258
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,360
I'm happy.

259
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,960
You said you would give it to me.

260
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,840
Don't be angry.

261
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,800
People are too greedy.

262
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,160
Hao Du,

263
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,600
you don't look so fierce,

264
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,600
right?

265
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Do my best.

266
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm not afraid of being lonely.

267
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,800
Hao Du,

268
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,760
where are the pastries you bought for me?

269
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,680
I ate them.

270
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,480
You ate them?

271
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,000
I didn't ask you to eat them.

272
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,000
Didn't you eat any of them?

273
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,200
I'm asking you.

274
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,560
Hao Du.

275
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,320
Hao Du.

276
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,160
Duke Du.

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,680
Your Highness.

278
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,760
Duke Du.

279
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Why are you here?

280
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
Chang'an received the news

281
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,120
that Your Highness had arrived in Luoyang.

282
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,760
But His Majesty is still worried about you.

283
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,520
So I must come and see you in person.

284
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,600
I want to see how you are doing.

285
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,560
You are...

286
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,200
His Majesty can finally rest in peace.

287
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,040
It's okay.

288
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,400
Thank you for your concern.

289
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
It's late.

290
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,200
Please go to bed early.

291
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
Okay.

292
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,560
You finally didn't fail His Majesty.

293
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
Your Highness has found him.

294
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,640
I'm relieved.

295
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,080
Father,

296
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,480
it's been a few days.

297
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,720
How are you feeling?

298
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,720
I'm getting old.

299
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,440
The cold is coming.

300
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,400
Come on.

301
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
Put your things away.

302
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,080
I'll tell you when I come to the court.

303
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,120
Yes.

304
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,480
Father,

305
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,360
you came to Luoyang

306
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
not just to visit Her Highness, right?

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,040
I have something to do.

308
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,000
Tell me

309
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,680
about Her Highness' experience.

310
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,280
I also came to Luoyang to find Her Highness.

311
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Her Highness suffered a lot.

312
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,840
She traveled all the way from the border to Luoyang.

313
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,040
It's good that you found Her Highness.

314
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,520
Luoyang is not safe.

315
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,680
You can leave tomorrow

316
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,480
and escort Her Highness back to Chang'an.

317
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,480
What's wrong?

318
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Is there a problem?

319
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,400
No.

320
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
But...

321
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Just tell me.

322
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't be so hasty.

323
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,880
Instead of asking Her Highness to return to Chang'an,

324
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
why don't we let her stay in Luoyang

325
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,880
to comfort the people?

326
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,600
I heard that Her Highness

327
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,600
can manage

328
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
with Her Highness around.

329
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,720
How is Her Highness?

330
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,080
Her Highness

331
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,840
has been unwell.

332
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
Now all the disasters in Luoyang

333
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,160
are caused by Her Highness.

334
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
The people trust Her Highness.

335
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,960
For the stability of Luoyang,

336
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,760
I hope that Her Highness can stay in Luoyang

337
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
and do what she likes.

338
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,520
I will do everything I can to protect Her Highness.

339
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,160
I won't make any mistakes.

340
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,240
Hao Du.

341
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,720
You are thinking for Her Highness now.

342
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,240
Of course.

343
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,680
She is Her Highness after all.

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,840
Just because she is Her Highness?

345
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,880
When I was your age,

346
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,200
I was always confused.

347
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,400
I didn't understand what others thought.

348
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
I didn't understand what I thought.

349
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
Father, I didn't...

350
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,400
No need to explain.

351
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
You young people

352
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,240
don't need to explain to me.

353
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Have some tea.

354
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,560
Is it Her Highness

355
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
or Leyan?

356
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
What am I thinking?

357
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,920
Good.

358
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,080
Good.

359
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,520
Come on.

360
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,520
Come on.

361
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,520
You...

362
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,160
It's you.

363
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,760
Your Highness, we meet again.

364
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,660
Your Highness, the

365
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,040
Wei's army is here again.

366
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,440
I have to sleep in the prison.

367
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,640
Why is he here?

368
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,720
I won't disturb you.

369
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,960
I'll leave first.

370
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
Don't go.

371
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Your Highness.

372
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,920
Your Highness.

373
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
I know.

374
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I know.

375
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,160
Your Highness.

376
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,560
If you are really free,

377
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,960
a man

378
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,440
will let my sister, a woman,

379
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
run around in the mountains.

380
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,680
I'm ashamed of you.

381
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,640
Your Highness.

382
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,720
Your Ladyship.

383
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

384
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,400
Your Ladyship.

385
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,040
This is from the Ziwei Palace.

386
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,240
Your Ladyship.

387
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,280
This is from the Ziwei Palace.

388
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,800
A gentleman

389
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
is always happy.

390
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
It seems that

391
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
it's right to place

392
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,600
Sheng Xin's chess here.

393
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,920
Cui Tong.

394
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,080
Yes.

395
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,160
Luoyang's capital

396
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
is dry and dry.

397
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm afraid

398
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,600
there will be a calamity.

399
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,360
Yes, Your Ladyship.

400
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,680
We made trouble for her.

401
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,040
What a silly girl.

402
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,040
You came here

403
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,160
at hotel.

404
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
It's okay.

405
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,440
I know nothing of her.

406
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,160
Changge,

407
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,080
Magistrate Du arrived in Luoyang.

408
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,800
Following the epidemicidal Print House,

409
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,960
you need to be careful.

410
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,360
stay in Liuyun Temple.

411
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,400
I can't do anything about the past.

412
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,840
But from now on,

413
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
I'll do my best

414
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,600
to protect you.

415
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,320
I'll take care of myself.

416
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,920
You too.

417
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,680
Here.

418
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,080
Be careful.

419
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,800
Be careful.

420
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,800
Be careful.

421
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
Thank you, aunt.

422
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,600
You'd better have a good rest.

423
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
We can't be late.

424
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay.

425
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Try it, my lady.

426
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,880
It won't hinder the activity.

427
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
Thank you. Thank you.

428
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,120
I've prepared some tea for you.

429
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,080
You're a noble lady from Chang'an.

430
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,400
I don't think you're a noble lady.

431
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,880
You're a living Bodhisattva.

432
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,240
My lady,

433
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
she's a princess.

434
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,960
She's not just a noble lady.

435
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,480
I'm so lucky.

436
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,480
Her Highness is so kind.

437
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,400
Your Highness,

438
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,040
you're so kind.

439
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,640
You're a living Bodhisattva.

440
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,480
No need.

441
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,000
People outside say

442
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
that all the people in Liuyun Temple are good people.

443
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,120
I think

444
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
there's a living Bodhisattva.

445
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,080
Yes.

446
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,720
Yes.

447
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,480
Yes.

448
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,640
The noble lady who came to Luoyang

449
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,000
is the crown prince's daughter.

450
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
We haven't seen her.

451
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
Actually, the crown prince is very considerate of you.

452
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,480
That's why he asked me to take care of you.

453
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,120
Yes.

454
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,520
No wonder the room said

455
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,720
that the crown prince is staying in Ziwei Palace.

456
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,720
The candlelight was lit all night.

457
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,480
It's a blessing for us.

458
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,480
Ziwei Palace is a palace of the former emperor.

459
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,400
What kind of blessing is this?

460
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,320
It's a blessing anyway.

461
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,920
Right?

462
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,160
Yes.

463
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
It must be for us.

464
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,240
It must be for us.

465
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,720
Thank you, living Bodhisattva.

466
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,240
Qunniang,

467
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,560
what are you doing?

468
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,280
There's a rumor that

469
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,920
there's a fire in Luoyang

470
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,720
that will be in three days.

471
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,360
It's just a rumor,

472
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,400
but we have many people here.

473
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,680
We should be careful.

474
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,640
Changge,

475
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,320
the fire that Qunniang said just now...

476
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,640
Don't worry too much.

477
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,520
It's just a rumor.

478
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,240
It's just a rumor.

479
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,200
The refugees have left their hometowns.

480
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,160
Now, it's a way to survive

481
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
if there's a farmland without a master.

482
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,800
This is not a farmland,

483
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,920
but the farmland of Liuyun Temple.

484
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,280
The rich people in Luoyang

485
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
are worried that the refugees have no roots

486
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
and dare not to give them a farmland.

487
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
But the master is not afraid.

488
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,880
Not only to give them a farmland,

489
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,120
but also to feed them

490
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
and to feed them.

491
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,680
The master is really a living Bodhisattva in Luoyang.

492
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Changge.

493
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,360
Brother Shuyu.

494
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,960
How are you?

495
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,920
How are you doing after we parted?

496
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm fine.

497
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm fine.

498
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,240
As long as you're fine.

499
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,800
When did you come back?

500
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
Why didn't you tell me?

501
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,760
Yan.

502
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,520
Why are you with Yan?

503
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,960
After we parted,

504
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
where did you go?

505
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,840
And...

506
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,560
Wei Shuyu,

507
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,520
you're asking too many questions.

508
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,960
All right.

509
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,160
I won't ask.

510
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,080
I won't ask anything.

511
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,200
As long as you're fine,

512
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,360
you won't leave again

513
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,760
after we come back, right?

514
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,960
I don't know.

515
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,360
This is not my home.

516
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,280
I have nowhere to go.

517
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
You can go back.

518
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,080
But this time, we must go back to Chang'an together.

519
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,520
You, me and Yan

520
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,320
can be like before.

521
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,080
Changge.

522
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,280
You're the same, Changge.

523
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,880
Li Changge is dead.

524
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,320
You can call me Li.

525
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
No matter what you call me,

526
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,920
you'll always be my Changge.

527
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,160
After so many things,

528
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,640
I see you two still

529
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,560
can take care of each other like before.

530
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm so happy for you.

531
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,760
Chang...

532
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,720
Li.

533
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,080
Can I talk to you alone?

534
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
I still have many refugees to take care of.

535
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I can't talk to you anymore.

536
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,680
Since you're here with the Crown Prince,

537
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,440
I'm sure you have a lot to do.

538
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,440
But...

539
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,640
Anyway,

540
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,120
I can't leave Luoyang for a while.

541
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,240
Take Luoyang away first.

542
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,080
If you want to make up for it in the future,

543
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,360
we have plenty of chances.

544
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,360
Please Garlic Jing.

545
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,880
Sir.

546
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,640
People rumour sounds from Luoyang, South Hill.

547
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,640
Rumours has gone viral these days.

548
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,960
I'm worried

549
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:13,460
the refugees will spread and

550
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,440
to catch the one they want.

551
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Choice won't be right.

552
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,480
Please helping me dortral soon.

553
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,440
Don't worry.

554
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,600
Everything has its fate.

555
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,680
As long as you're sure.

556
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,000
No.

557
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
I'm not sure.

558
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,560
Li,

559
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,800
even if it's a little late,

560
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,480
I can't say

561
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,200
that I can control everything.

562
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,720
Not to mention people.

563
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,360
It's good to have a good fortune.

564
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,640
It's also good to have a good master.

565
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,760
Fortune is just a tree.

566
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,840
The way is the way.

567
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,280
What does it mean?

568
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,080
The one who can save is right in front of you.

569
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,600
How can you not save him?

570
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,440
You can't save him in the future.

571
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,240
So what?

572
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
This way is not different.

573
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,600
You can do it with your heart.

574
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The consequences are your own.

575
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Who in this world

576
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,360
is not like this?

577
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,200
Pingjing.

578
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:51,200
You said that you wanted

579
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,320
What are you thinking about?

580
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,880
Nothing.

581
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,240
By the way,

582
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,240
the Crown Prince is always in the Ziwei Palace

583
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,880
looking for happiness and joy.

584
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,640
If this continues,

585
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,840
there will be trouble.

586
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,040
My brother

587
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,240
is spoiled.

588
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,760
If it doesn't work,

589
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,720
just tell Minister Du.

590
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,440
My brother is most afraid of

591
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,040
the gentlemen around him.

592
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,760
Now,

593
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,200
the refugees in Nanshan

594
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,760
are also discussing this matter.

595
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,120
If he goes on being so naughty,

596
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,040
how can he save the people?

597
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,040
That's good.

598
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,320
Changge also knows

599
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,680
the Crown Prince is in Luoyang.

600
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,200
Brother Shuyu,

601
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
are you worried about what Changge will do?

602
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,360
You don't believe in Changge?

603
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,040
I promise

604
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
Changge won't do anything stupid.

605
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,400
I believe you.

606
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm leaving, too.

607
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
You're leaving?

608
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,800
My Lord,

609
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,560
I found the one.

610
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,120
My Lord,

611
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,680
the young fellow said

612
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,720
he asked you

613
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,600
to Dopamine given to me.

614
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,760
Only then

615
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,400
I Conveniently pleased you.

616
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,000
Go.

617
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,480
Where are the rules?

618
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,560
What are the rules?

619
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,840
One, no ban.

620
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,040
Two, no talk.

621
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,880
The rest is up to you.

622
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,720
No ban.

623
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,840
Come on.

624
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,600
How about this?

625
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,640
You all do this.

626
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,360
Let me see.

627
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,520
Yes.

628
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,320
Sit.

629
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,120
🔥Ore – Worm packet🔥

630
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,000
You!

631
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,880
You!

632
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,280
It's you!

633
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Your Highness, you are so thoughtful.

634
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,680
I, Sheng Xin, greet Your Highness.

635
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,080
No need. No need.

636
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,080
Okay.

637
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,080
I will keep you.

638
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,240
Then Your Highness,

639
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,720
please keep us all.

640
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,520
It's more lively with more people.

641
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,520
You are right.

642
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,160
Okay.

643
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,040
You all,

644
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
stay.

645
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

646
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Your Highness,

647
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm sorry.

648
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm sorry.

649
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
Wait.

650
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Minister Lu.

651
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Thank you.

652
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Minister Lu wants to see Mr. Li.

653
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
But he may not be at home.

654
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,800
He's not in Luoyang.

655
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
He is.

656
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,160
But he may be in the tea house in the west.

657
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,880
Or in the wine house in the south.

658
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
He may be anywhere in Luoyang.

659
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,880
But he may not be at home.

660
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,760
He's in Luoyang.

661
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,280
But he never goes home?

662
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,480
It's hard to say when he's in Xiaojin.

663
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
I heard he married a Han woman.

664
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
He should hide all day.

665
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Minister.

666
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,720
Mr. Wei.

667
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,840
You are in a hurry.

668
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,040
Is there anything?

669
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
Minister Du.

670
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,360
I've sent the disaster relief supplies

671
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
from Jinzhou.

672
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Luoyang is doing well.

673
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
But...

674
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,640
You have something to say.

675
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,000
But since the Crown Prince moved into Ziwei Palace,

676
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
he hasn't shown up.

677
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,000
It's all Princess Yongan's plan.

678
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,840
People are afraid of him.

679
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
And...

680
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,200
And the Crown Prince

681
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
is always with a bunch of scoundrels.

682
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Ridiculous.

683
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,200
pee

684
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
pee

685
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,200
pee

686
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Hi, My Lord.

687
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,680
My Lord.

688
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
My Lord.

689
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Your Highness, are you all right?

690
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm fine.

691
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Immortal, how are you?

692
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's good that Your Highness is fine.

693
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's a pity that we didn't bring the Go-go wolf with us.

694
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This situation where the people are hurt and the Prince is in pain

695
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
is not to be brought to the court.

696
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Your Highness,

697
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're not allowed to go to the court.

701
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Minister Du,

702
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Father is very considerate.

703
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
He doesn't need to know about this, right?

704
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Rumour has it that

705
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Your Highness is reluctant to give the night-sleeping pill.

706
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It will be a disadvantage to the person who doesn't sleep well.

707
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
If this continues,

708
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
His Majesty will not want to know about it.

709
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
He will know about it.

710
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Minister Du,

711
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm very grateful.

713
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Thank you, Minister Du.

714
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He is a friend of mine in Luoyang.

715
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
If Minister Du is not satisfied,

716
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'll tell him to go wherever he wants.

717
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Your Highness,

718
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
do it well.

719
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Your Highness,

720
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
if you want me to leave,

721
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'll leave.

722
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm so happy to see you.

723
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You're so happy.

724
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm so happy to see you

725
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
in such a wonderful banquet.

726
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Minister Du and I are right.

727
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'll tell you to go wherever you want.

728
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But you're a member of the Chang'an Taichang Temple.

729
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You can go anywhere without me.

730
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

731
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's a pleasure to meet you.

732
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Thank you.

733
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Where is Ashile Sun?

734
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Isn't he looking for people?

735
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He left in the dark.

736
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
He has a map of Luoyang.

737
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,600
Who is it?

738
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,840
Sorry.

739
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,400
My hand slipped.

740
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,840
Little ghost,

741
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
wait for good news from Xu Feng.

742
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,720
Let's go.

743
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,960
The

744
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,440
A'Li,

745
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,280
is the meal today to your taste?

746
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,280
A'Li,

747
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,080
you don't have any benefits

748
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,240
staying in the temple all day.

749
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,600
Go to buy medicine with me.

750
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,760
It's a good time to relax.

751
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,240
I think it's good to stay in the temple.

752
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,440
It's a good time to rest.

753
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
As long as A'Li feels good.

754
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,200
That's right.

755
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,720
A'Li, are you ready?

756
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,440
Yes.

757
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,160
A'Li.

758
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,160
A'Li.

759
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,840
Don't be so petty.

760
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,000
Do you know what I've found out today?

761
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,360
I'm a little tired after a day's walk.

762
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,160
How about this?

763
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,080
Help me to stretch my legs.

764
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,120
I'll tell you.

765
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,280
What?

766
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,400
You don't want to?

767
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,200
You're so rude.

768
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,920
We rented the house.

769
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,560
We found out the news.

770
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,840
Are you too...

771
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,760
Chop it off.

772
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
You won't be tired.

773
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,680
Any clues?

774
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,040
I won't bother you.

775
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
There is a clue.

776
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,840
It's said that a man named Sun Simiao

777
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,480
came to Luoyang from the prairie.

778
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,840
Someone said he tried hard

779
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,120
to save a young lady.

780
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,200
Isn't Commandant Li

781
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,720
just a young lady?

782
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,960
What else?

783
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,200
Why are you not surprised at all?

784
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,080
I thought you didn't know.

785
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Stop talking nonsense.

786
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,840
What else is there?

787
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,000
Sun Simiao is not sure about his whereabouts.

788
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,920
We only know that he will check on the refugees.

789
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,240
But we're not sure

790
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,280
where he is.

791
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,680
Is there any place in Luoyang

792
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,000
where refugees are taken in?

793
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,800
There seems to be a place

794
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
called Liuyun Temple.

795
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,760
Liuyun Temple?

796
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,760
Why is he running away again?

797
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Liuyun Temple

798
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,040
Anyone here?

799
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,760
Sir,

800
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,320
we've closed the door today.

801
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,200
If you're not ill,

802
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,880
you can come back another day.

803
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
May I make a comment?

804
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
I'm here to find someone.

805
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,080
Is Li Changge here?

806
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,360
Or is he from Li's Temple?

807
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,720
Li Changge?

808
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,320
There's no one in our temple

809
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,440
with this name.

810
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,840
You must have found the wrong place.

811
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,880
Please leave now.

812
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,840
What about Sun Simiao?

813
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,640
Is there anyone like him?

814
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,600
How can you

815
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
know about Sun Zhenren's name?

816
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,080
Yes, Sun Zhenren.

817
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,400
He hasn't saved a woman.

818
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,440
The person he saved

819
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,360
is not a woman.

820
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,680
It's not just a woman.

821
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,560
I'm sorry.

822
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,960
Changge.

823
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,960
How can you break in?

824
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,240
I'm going to shout.

825
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,520
Changge.

826
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,240
Changge.

827
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,240
Changge.

828
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,680
Changge.

829
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,240
Changge.

830
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,800
hooks

831
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Before you say goodbye

832
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,520
I hope

833
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,520
I can remember your voice

834
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,520
And lock it into my tender dream

835
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,520
Before dawn

836
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
Before the years

837
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,520
The longing flows through the years

838
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,520
There is always a moment

839
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,520
That burns into the wastelands in my heart

840
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,520
There is always a longing

841
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Between you and me

842
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,520
I see everything

843
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
In each other's world

844
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
In different worlds

845
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,520
I am in the long-lost love

846
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
The deep love

847
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Becomes eternity

848
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,520
The cocoon in the sky

849
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,520
There is always a moment

850
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,520
That burns into the wastelands in my heart

851
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,520
There is always a longing

852
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Between you and me

853
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,520
I see everything

854
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
In each other's world

855
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
In different worlds

856
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,520
I am in the long-lost love

857
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,520
The deep love

858
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,520
Becomes eternity

859
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,520
The cocoon in the sky

860
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,520
There is always a moment

861
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,520
That burns into the wastelands in my heart
