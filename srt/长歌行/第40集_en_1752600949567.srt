1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
To the distance

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
The past is broken

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Follow the direction of light

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Forget you

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,840
The memory is broken

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,840
The shape of stubbornness

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,840
I want to use the light in the dark night

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I want to be with him

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,840
He is the light of life and the light of the king

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,840
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Episode 16

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Welcome.

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's go.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Here we are.

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Here we are.

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Is it beautiful?

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Look at that.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
There is no one in the desert.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
I left this garden especially for you.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
So that you can live more comfortably.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Don't be angry with them.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Thank you.

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Can you say thank you to each other?

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
If you are not used to it, come to me anytime.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
It's been a long journey.

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Since it's arranged,

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
why don't you go back and rest earlier?

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Then you should rest earlier.

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Changge, we have so many rooms.

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Where do you live?

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Princess, you choose first.

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
That's great.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
I live over there.

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
You two come with me.

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes.

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Hurry up.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Then Changge, which room do you live in?

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Which room do you live in?

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
I'll clean it up for you first.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm not in a hurry to choose.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Because I'm going to a place

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
to meet a very important person.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Then I'll go with you.

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Sir,

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
it's good to report to the palace.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
You go to rest first.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I'll go by myself.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Yes.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Brother Shuyu looks very tired.

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Didn't you see me?

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Mr. Wei just came back.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
He left again without entering the house.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Greetings, Princess Yongan.

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Please get up.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Thank you, Princess.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Mr. Wei is so in a hurry.

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Where did he go?

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Princess,

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Mr. Wei just came back from the temple

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
to settle the Mobei matter.

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
He went to the palace to do his work.

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
It's really hard for Mr. Wei.

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Did the journey go well?

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Everything went well.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
But Mr. Wei seems to have met an old friend in Mobei City.

69
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Princess, this is Princess Mobei's room.

70
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I see.

71
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Yes.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
It's you.

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Last time I...

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
How dare you!

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
This is Princess Yongan from Tang.

76
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
An Rou.

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Ignore it.

78
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
You are the princess.

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
So she is Changge's friend.

80
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
But Changge has a grudge against the palace.

81
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Should I go with her?

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
No.

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
I don't want to see her.

84
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I don't want to see her.

85
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
I don't want to see her.

86
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
I don't want to see her.

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I don't want to see her.

88
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
I don't want to see her.

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
I don't want to see her.

90
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
I don't want to see her.

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Should I tell her that Changge is in Chang'an?

92
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
I didn't expect you to be the princess of Mobei.

93
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
It's a misunderstanding about Yunzhou.

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
But I've been wanting to ask you.

95
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
How did you know

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
that my purse has a rabbit in it?

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Because my purse

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
also has that word embroidered.

99
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
It might be a coincidence.

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Then we have some fate.

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
My purse was given to me by my best friend.

102
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I thought you knew each other.

103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
In that case,

104
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
you should take a good rest.

105
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
If you need anything,

106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,840
you can ask the servants of the Four-way Hall to do it.

107
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
I won't bother you.

108
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
I won't bother you.

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
What should we do?

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
She's still alive.

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
If the princess knows about this,

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
she'll be very happy.

113
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Your Highness,

114
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
how come you're so absent-minded

115
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
after returning from the Four-way Hall?

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I saw the princess just now.

117
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I suddenly remembered Changge.

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I wonder if she's doing well recently.

119
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
I just saw her.

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
She's fine.

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm glad to hear that.

122
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm glad to hear that.

123
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm glad to hear that.

124
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I'm glad to hear that.

125
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
How is she doing?

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,840
You said the purse was from Yunzhou.

127
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I was confused.

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
It's all in the past.

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
It doesn't matter.

130
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Mr. Wei may still be in the palace.

131
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Do you want to see him?

132
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Shuyu has been busy these days.

133
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
I'll go in a few days.

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Shuyu

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
This is...

136
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
This is where my mother sleeps.

137
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I want to take you to see her.

138
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
What are you doing?

139
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
What are you doing?

140
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
It's the first time your mother sees me.

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I have to leave a good impression on her.

142
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
If my mother saw you in person,

143
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
she would like you very much.

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Changge,

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
thank you for bringing me to see your mother.

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Let's go.

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Shuyu

148
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
It seems that someone has been missing your mother.

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Not only will you come to clean up regularly,

150
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
these offerings are also very fresh.

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Yes.

152
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I didn't expect that someone in Chang'an City would remember my mother.

153
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
I don't know if it's Leyan or Shuyu who did it.

154
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
When I left Chang'an City,

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
the most worried thing was that the people in Chang'an City

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
would forget her insignificant sacrifice.

157
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
But now it seems that

158
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I am relieved.

159
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Mother,

160
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
I am back.

161
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I am back to see you.

162
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
This is Sun.

163
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I want to bring him to see you.

164
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
I am Ashile Sun.

165
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Greetings, Madam.

166
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Changge,

167
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
I want to propose a toast to your mother.

168
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Madam,

169
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
this is our first meeting.

170
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I am not well prepared.

171
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I can only use a bottle of wine

172
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
to express my apology and respect.

173
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
All the way,

174
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Changge suffered a lot because of me.

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Please forgive me.

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Now Changge is in love with me.

177
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Let me take care of her in the future.

178
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Madam, don't worry.

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I will definitely love her more and more.

180
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Take care of her and make up for her.

181
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
What nonsense are you talking about in front of my mother?

182
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
It's not nonsense.

183
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
It's true.

184
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Have you forgotten what you said in Mobei?

185
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Are you going to regret it in front of Madam?

186
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
The woman we grassland people value

187
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
is the one who will love her,

188
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
protect her,

189
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
and take care of her for the rest of her life.

190
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Sun,

191
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
thank you.

192
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
There is no need

193
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
for us to say this word.

194
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Mother,

195
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
I will come to see you often in the future.

196
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Sun and I

197
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
will be together.

198
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Changge.

199
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Changge.

200
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
I am worried about you.

201
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I am relieved

202
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
to see you

203
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
safe and sound.

204
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I haven't identified the murderer yet.

205
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I will live well

206
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
and be happy.

207
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
I will be happy

208
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
to see you safe and sound.

209
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
I will live well

210
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Stop.

211
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Stay away from her.

212
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
She is a living creature.

213
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Aren't you afraid of the consequences?

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

215
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

216
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

217
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

218
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

219
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

220
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

221
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

222
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

223
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

224
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

227
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I am afraid of the consequences.

228
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Don't be a coward.

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
You don't deserve to come here.

230
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I will kill you one day.

231
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Changge.

232
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
If you really want to kill me,

233
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I would be your spy

234
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
when we are in Weishui.

235
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
If I am not wrong,

236
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
you shot the arrow

237
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
at Weishui, right?

238
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
I didn't want to save you.

239
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I want to save the people of Tang.

240
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
You can value the people of Tang

241
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
and the people.

242
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
You can't ruin the country because of your hatred.

243
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Good.

244
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Good.

245
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Xiao Yongning

246
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
has really grown up.

247
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
You have told me

248
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
about your life in Luoyang.

249
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
You have told me about it.

250
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
So what?

251
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I won't forgive you.

252
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
I don't want your forgiveness.

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
I don't want Jin's forgiveness.

254
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Shut up.

255
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
You can't call my mother's name.

256
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Fang Yi.

257
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I am sorry.

258
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Don't worry.

259
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
You value the country.

260
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
You won't hurt His Majesty.

261
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
You are my child.

262
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
I know my child.

263
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
What kind of person is he?

264
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
You are a perfect match.

265
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Someone can protect you.

266
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I think

267
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Jin will be happy

268
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
with you.

269
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
He has been worshiping my mother.

270
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Mother.

271
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Your hatred can't be avenged.

272
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
This is the protective tool you prepared.

273
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
You can live in Tang

274
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
with a new identity.

275
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
You don't need to hide anymore.

276
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
That's what he means.

277
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
It doesn't matter who he means.

278
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
We hope you can start over

279
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
and live the life you want.

280
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Change the name and change the letter.

281
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Burry the past.

282
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
That's what you want.

283
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
I hope you can live a good life.

284
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I've been your teacher for years.

285
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
I know you well.

286
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Since you are not obsessed with revenge,

287
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
why do you

288
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
put yourself in the past?

289
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I still have unfinished missions.

290
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
That secret letter

291
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
is really from you.

292
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Are you determined

293
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
to be the ambassador of the desert?

294
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm from Mobei.

295
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm here for the sake of the alliance.

296
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
If Tang is willing to be the bridge of Mobei,

297
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
then the whole Mobei

298
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
will be the bridge of Tang.

299
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
If Ashile people want to

300
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
invade the desert,

301
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
or they want to get the sword

302
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
to use against Tang,

303
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
they will think twice.

304
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Do you know

305
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
if each department

306
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
decides to ally

307
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
only because of the situation,

308
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
and not sincerely seeking peace,

309
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
then this alliance

310
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
is

311
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
just a

312
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
one-off

313
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
alliance.

314
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
It's worth it.

315
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
It's worth it.

316
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Sir,

317
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
you are now standing

318
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
beside a stronger person.

319
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Is it because of fear?

320
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Changge,

321
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
have you ever thought

322
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
that when Prince Qi and your father

323
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
were about to cause trouble to His Majesty,

324
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
such a confidential matter

325
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
would be the most important thing

326
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
for His Majesty to know?

327
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Of course, the spies in the Eastern Palace

328
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
reported it to him.

329
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Crown Prince Jiancheng is very thoughtful.

330
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Even if His Majesty is there,

331
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
he can't get into his study.

332
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Who could it be?

333
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
How about

334
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
I tell you a story?

335
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
That year,

336
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Emperor Yang of Suiyang was on a long journey to the north.

337
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
He knew that the official of Yanmen

338
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
was trapped by Ashile Tribe.

339
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
A young general

340
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
saved a young and beautiful girl

341
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
on his way to Qin.

342
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Later,

343
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
the young general

344
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
was going to go out soon

345
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
to let the girl

346
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
stay with the girl.

347
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
So,

348
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
he was the savior of Mother.

349
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Impossible.

350
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Then...

351
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Then...

352
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Mother...

353
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Mother wouldn't hurt Father.

354
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Father is her husband.

355
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
I haven't finished my story yet.

356
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
That young general

357
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
went out of the house

358
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
and made a great contribution.

359
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
He was considered a great man.

360
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Later,

361
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
the number of times he went out was increasing.

362
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
But he didn't know that

363
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
after he went out,

364
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
his brother

365
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
mistook that girl

366
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
for his concubine.

367
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
After he went out of the house,

368
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
that girl

369
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
was pregnant.

370
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
That child is me.

371
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
After you were born,

372
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
the general has a lot of love for you.

373
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Maybe it's your fate.

374
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
When you were young,

375
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
you met your father.

376
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
But you didn't know

377
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
how much he loved you.

378
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Even your father didn't know.

379
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Only when you met this general,

380
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
you laughed a lot.

381
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Then you grew up.

382
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
You have

383
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
the memories of your parents.

384
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
I don't want to talk about it.

385
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Changge.

386
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
In this world,

387
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
the only one who cares about

388
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
your mother and daughter

389
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
is her.

390
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
But why didn't Mother

391
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
mention this to me?

392
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
Is this the only thing

393
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
that keeps you from being happy?

394
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Father never

395
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
treated me well.

396
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
I thought I didn't do well enough.

397
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't even know

398
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
what mother thinks.

399
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
What kind of daughter am I?

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Changge.

401
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
You brought a lot of happiness

402
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
to your mother.

403
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
It's because of you

404
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
that your mother is not lonely.

405
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Then since...

406
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Since it was my mother who reported it,

407
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
why did she kill my mother?

408
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Sometimes,

409
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
what you see

410
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
may not be the whole truth.

411
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
The whole truth?

412
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
The whole truth.

413
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Sun.

414
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Are you saying that

415
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
what Mr. Wei said is true?

416
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
It turns out that

417
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
the hatred I always thought

418
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
was created by myself.

419
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Is that true?

420
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Changge.

421
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
It's not your fault.

422
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Everything in the world is complicated.

423
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
How can you

424
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
report the truth?

425
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Everyone who wants to leave Chang'an

426
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
will definitely go through this path.

427
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
At that time,

428
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I left here

429
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
as the rebellious Princess Li Tang.

430
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I thought when I came back,

431
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
I would take the army horse

432
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
and take the blood to remember

433
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
my father's name.

434
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
But I didn't expect

435
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
that I would be so confused now.

436
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
I'm even more worried about my enemy.

437
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
But I have to admit that

438
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
he is indeed a good emperor.

439
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
I should hate him.

440
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
But he has loved me the most since I was a child.

441
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
He taught me all the skills.

442
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
He even treated me

443
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
better than my mother.

444
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I understand your feelings.

445
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
When my mother died,

446
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
I also wanted to kill her

447
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
and avenge my mother.

448
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
But when I really wanted to kill her,

449
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I was also hesitating.

450
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
If I really kill her,

451
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
it will drag the lives of

452
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
all my people in Eagle Division.

453
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
It will involve the stability of the whole grassland.

454
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
I don't want that.

455
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Not to mention my mother.

456
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
When the conflict between the family and the righteous,

457
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
it will inevitably become

458
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
a perfect mess.

459
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Not to mention that

460
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
you are facing the whole country

461
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
and the thousands of people behind it.

462
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
You are worried

463
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
because you care about

464
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
the blessings of more people.

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
I think

466
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
your parents

467
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
will not blame you.

468
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
It's all in the past.

469
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
It's all in the past.

470
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
Whether your mother

471
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
informed her or not,

472
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
this tragedy

473
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
may not be avoided.

474
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Your mother is stuck between

475
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
two brothers.

476
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
She must be having a hard time.

477
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
I know.

478
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
I just care about my mother.

479
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
She can't tell anyone about these things.

480
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
No wonder my mother

481
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
taught me to kneel in front of Buddha.

482
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
She told me to

483
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
live my life without hating you.

484
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
She knew it all along.

485
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Your mother is an amazing woman.

486
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
And an amazing mother.

487
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
So Changge,

488
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
cheer up.

489
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Live a good life.

490
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Sun,

491
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
when these things are over,

492
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Tang, the desert,

493
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
and even the whole grassland

494
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
will be at a very long time of peace.

495
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Then

496
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
let's go to the field to live, okay?

497
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Wherever you go,

498
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'll go.

499
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
I'm sorry.

500
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
I'm sorry.

501
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I'm sorry.

502
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm sorry.

503
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I'm sorry.

505
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
I'm sorry.

512
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I'm sorry.

513
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm sorry.

515
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
I'm sorry.

516
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm sorry.

517
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
I'm sorry.

518
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
I'm sorry.

520
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm sorry.

522
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm sorry.

523
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm sorry.

524
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm sorry.

525
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
I'm sorry.

526
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
I'm sorry.

528
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm sorry.

529
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Changge.

530
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
What's wrong with you?

531
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
You seem to be in a bad mood.

532
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
I'm fine.

533
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
It's just that I'm too obsessive.

534
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
I've magnified my family's grudge.

535
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
I almost...

536
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
I almost killed the person who was the best for me.

537
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
It's all in the past.

538
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Did you forgive your father's enemy?

539
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
I don't know.

540
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
It's hard to say clearly

541
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,840
whether it's right or wrong.

542
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
If I had known earlier, I would have told him.

543
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
What?

544
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Yesterday, the princess of Tang came.

545
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
The princess you gave her the pouch.

546
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Leyan?

547
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Did she say anything when she came?

548
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
She thought I was Princess Mobei.

549
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
She even asked me how I knew about this pouch.

550
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
But I didn't tell her the truth.

551
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
I was afraid that you still had an enemy in mind.

552
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
She is my best friend in Chang'an.

553
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Indeed.

554
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
I should have seen her first when I came.

555
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Princess.

556
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Didn't we go to the private house yesterday?

557
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Why are we going there again today?

558
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
And we're not taking the carriage.

559
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
It's so mysterious.

560
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Princess.

561
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
What's so mysterious?

562
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Yesterday,

563
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
it wasn't Princess Mobei.

564
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
From her clothes,

565
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
cloth and materials,

566
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
we can see that she's not from the nobility.

567
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
I guess

568
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
she's just a maid.

569
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Princess.

570
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
You...

571
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
You can judge by these?

572
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Yesterday, when I asked her about the pouch,

573
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
she was so stubborn and childish.

574
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
She's totally different from her

575
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
in Yunzhou.

576
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
So I'm sure

577
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
she knows Changge.

578
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
What?

579
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Princess Yongning is there too?

580
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
For Changge's safety,

581
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
we can't reveal it.

582
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
This time,

583
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I just want to verify

584
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
whether my guess is right.

585
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
I don't want to alert anyone.

586
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
I also hope

587
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Changge is really there.

588
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Let's go.

589
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Haodu.

590
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
I saw you didn't arrange a carriage

591
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
when you left the palace.

592
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
I was worried about your safety.

593
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,840
So you're following me again?

594
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
I'm just worried about your safety.

595
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
This is Chang'an.

596
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm safe.

597
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
You're right.

598
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
But now,

599
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
the ambassadors from all departments are visiting Chang'an.

600
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
You'd better be careful.

601
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm not.

602
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
I'm not.

603
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm not.

604
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
I'm not.

605
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
I'm not.

606
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm not.

607
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
I'm not.

608
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I'm not.

609
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
You'd better be careful.

610
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Haodu.

611
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
You said

612
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
you only catch people who hurt Tang.

613
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Yes.

614
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
If you're worried,

615
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
I'll follow you.

616
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
As long as there's no danger,

617
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
I won't disturb you and...

618
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
...your friend's reunion.

619
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Okay.

620
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I don't want to

621
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
draw more criticism.

622
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
I see.

623
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
I'll keep it a secret.

624
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Okay.

625
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Changge.

626
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Changge.

627
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Just let me go with you.

628
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Don't worry.

629
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I'll be fine.

630
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
But this is Chang'an.

631
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
You were hurt by the new place.

632
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
I'm really worried about you.

633
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
If you don't agree with me again,

634
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
I'll tell Sun.

635
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
You two must get out.

636
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,480
What's up?

637
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,320
I want to see Leyan.

638
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,320
You want to go to the palace?

639
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,760
But before I go to see Leyan,

640
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,480
I have to find Shuyu first.

641
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
No need to find her.

642
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Changge.

643
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,600
Leyan.

644
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,000
Changge.

645
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
I knew you were here.

646
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,760
Although I didn't see you yesterday,

647
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,800
I have a feeling that you must be here.

648
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,600
It's my fault.

649
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,240
I went to find you as soon as I arrived in Chang'an.

650
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
It's not too late to see you again.

651
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,520
This is my sister I met in the grassland.

652
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,600
Her name is Mimi Guli.

653
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,920
You should have seen her.

654
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,560
This is...

655
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,560
I know her.

656
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,200
She saved you in Luoyang.

657
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,240
Her name is Sun.

658
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,120
Sun, this is my sister.

659
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,040
Okay.

660
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Stop talking here.

661
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,920
Let's go in.

662
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,440
Let's go.

663
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,800
I'm so happy today.

664
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,360
My good friends are all here.

665
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,120
I never thought

666
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
that we could be together like this.

667
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,440
Changge.

668
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,360
Will you leave Chang'an again?

669
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,200
That's right.

670
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,040
Chang'an can't keep you.

671
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm sorry.

672
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,840
I'm sorry.

673
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,640
I'm sorry.

674
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm sorry.

675
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,160
I'm sorry.

676
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,920
I'm sorry.

677
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,640
I'm sorry.

678
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,960
But

679
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,160
why did you become the Princess of Mobei?

680
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,280
It's a long story.

681
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,320
This is a song of the stone bell.

682
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,960
Stone bell?

683
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
The stone bell is used to entertain new envoys

684
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
in the guest house.

685
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,800
But the envoys of each department have arrived.

686
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,240
Why are there still new envoys coming to Chang'an?

687
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,840
I don't know.

688
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,840
How about this, Mimi?

689
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,160
Wait here.

690
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,600
I'll go with Leyan.

691
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,160
Okay.

692
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,520
Go back quickly.

693
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,480
Okay.

694
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,160
Why are you so nervous?

695
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
What should we do?

696
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,920
We have to find a way.

697
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,040
We can't wait here.

698
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,800
That's right.

699
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,280
Right?

700
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,440
Changge.

701
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,520
Changge.

702
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,160
Who is this woman from Tang?

703
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,800
May I ask, Princess?

704
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,480
Do you know that

705
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,000
the envoy of Ashile Tribe is here?

706
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:19,880
Princess.

707
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Did Tang invite them here?

708
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,480
Tang didn't mean that.

709
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
You...

710
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,800
You're from Tang?

711
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,320
Princess Mobei is meeting with Tang in private?

712
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,680
That's not true.

713
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,320
Ashile Tribe came to Tang

714
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,600
because they knew

715
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,640
we were going to meet them.

716
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,480
I don't care how you collude with each other.

717
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,000
But we have to leave here quickly.

718
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,000
Zhixin.

719
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
If Ashile Tribe knows

720
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,080
we're going to meet Tang,

721
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,800
if they attack us now,

722
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,400
they'll kill us.

723
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,360
That's right.

724
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,440
We have to go back quickly.

725
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,600
Don't worry.

726
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,520
Tang will never abandon us.

727
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,520
I can promise you that

728
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,280
I'm Princess Yongan of Tang.

729
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,280
Princess?

730
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,360
She's a princess?

731
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,320
No.

732
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,880
We have to leave here quickly.

733
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,720
Tang is far away from the emperor.

734
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,120
It's not a big deal

735
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,120
if you say so now.

736
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,000
When the time comes,

737
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,280
we'll be dead.

738
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,840
They'll definitely abandon us.

739
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,640
That's right.

740
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,320
Let's go.

741
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,080
Let's go.

742
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,120
Listen to me.

743
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,000
Stop fighting.

744
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,800
Wait a minute.

745
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,480
Move aside.

746
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,720
Listen to me.

747
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,480
Listen to me.

748
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,160
Listen to me.

749
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,120
I'm telling you.

750
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,080
Listen to me.

751
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,800
No.

752
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,360
Are you done?

753
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,720
Since

754
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Ashile Tribe dared to come to the Four-way Hall,

755
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,720
it's because they came to pass the official document.

756
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,360
They came to make trouble.

757
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,280
But if anything happens,

758
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,400
will Tang ignore it?

759
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,920
What are you afraid of?

760
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,440
What's going on?

761
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,200
Don't worry.

762
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,840
Why are you all standing?

763
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,040
Are you welcoming me?

764
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,440
Ke Han.

765
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,800
It's you.

766
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,920
Ashile Tribe is here.

767
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,680
Yes.

768
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,520
I heard that Ke Han came personally.

769
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,200
The lady he sent

770
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,200
seems to be Ketun from Ashile Tribe.

771
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
Really?

772
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,360
It should be true.

773
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
I heard it was true.

774
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,920
Ketun.

775
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,200
He should come.

776
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,280
The past has been destroyed.

777
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,280
Now,

778
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,880
you can be brave

779
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,760
and be yourself.

780
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,360
Look.

781
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,040
As long as I don't come,

782
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,160
these people

783
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,400
will be like the rabbits who saw the flies.

784
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,520
They will only run away.

785
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,880
Who ran away?

786
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,360
We are not afraid of them.

787
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,280
Hold on.

788
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
You are not tired at all.

789
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,840
What do you want to be

790
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,160
in this temple?

791
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,040
If I tell you who you are here,

792
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,800
will you...

793
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,680
Xiu'er.

794
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,880
You...

795
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,080
You are still alive.

796
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,520
Why did you lie to me?

797
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,560
You bastard.

798
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,560
I thought you were dead.

799
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,520
I didn't expect you to pretend to be dead.

800
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,560
You coward.

801
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,520
You liar.

802
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,400
I even looked at you with my eyes.

803
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Sometimes, I even engraved your name on my back.

804
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,800
You don't deserve it.

805
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,200
Stop pretending to be innocent here.

806
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,280
You are all behind me.

807
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,560
You are behind me.

808
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,720
Don't tell me you know nothing.

809
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,640
I don't want to be your enemy anymore.

810
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
But from now on,

811
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,400
we are no longer brothers.

812
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
The End

813
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,440
Li Cheng actually killed Cha Lan.

814
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,680
This is...

815
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
Long time no see,

816
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,720
Li Changge.

817
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
The End

818
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,440
Great Khan, you are so quiet today.

819
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,840
When you just moved into the sleeping room,

820
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,360
you were always shouting in the room.

821
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,360
That's right.

822
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,240
Maybe the medicine worked.

823
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,640
It's not noisy anymore.

824
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,520
Great Khan, you are so great.

825
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,640
Now you are sick,

826
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,080
you are so...

827
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,840
What are you talking about?

828
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,640
I told you.

829
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,720
You can't tell me

830
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,880
anything about this place.

831
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,360
Please, please, please forgive the little ones.

832
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,480
The little ones know their mistakes.

833
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,800
No next time.

834
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,360
It is kind enough to have you live.

835
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,120
You let everybody know

836
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,400
this is where the swallow gets her lightly bite.

837
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,520
Brother Han, you're sick.

838
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,400
You're having my

839
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,320
weirdUSH.

840
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,740
Gu Síni is

841
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,840
willing to survive

842
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,400
in the region.

843
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,380
Besides,

844
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Xian Jing tensions with them

845
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,840
wereidse.

846
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,160
I knew it.

847
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,300
How scallious!

848
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,440
Great Khan has been sick recently.

849
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,000
I had to bring him here

850
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,160
with my son

851
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,480
to show my sincerity to the Tang

852
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,320
and other tribes.

853
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,000
Of course,

854
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,440
it's also for the engagement

855
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,840
between the Tang and Ashile Tribe.

856
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
I shouldn't have come,

857
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,280
but for my children's marriage,

858
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,880
at least one of my parents

859
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,400
is here.

860
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,360
The Tang has always been a promise.

861
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,280
I believe this time

862
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
the Tang will not break their promise.

863
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,640
I think everyone came to Chang'an

864
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,720
because they believed in this.

865
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,280
They came to get married.

866
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
To get married?

867
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,040
Come on.

868
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,160
Let me drink to everyone.

869
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,640
Changge,

870
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,160
he means

871
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
His Majesty promised

872
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,440
to marry Ashile Tribe.

873
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,040
If he doesn't,

874
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
does it mean

875
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
he will break the promise?

876
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,240
How dare he say that

877
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
in this kind of occasion?

878
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,640
Is he sure that

879
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,640
the Tang will not marry her?

880
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,160
Hao Du,

881
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,680
take her away first.

882
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,760
I'll deal with her.

883
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,520
I'll deal with her.

884
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,200
I'll deal with her.

885
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Kedun and Young Khan just arrived today.

886
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,400
On behalf of Mobei,

887
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,760
I'd like to propose a toast

888
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
to Kedun and Young Khan.

889
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,360
Wait.

890
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,960
Why don't I let your guards

891
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,960
drink for you?

892
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,440
Okay.

893
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,520
You're quite good at discipline.

894
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,760
Khatun can represent Ashile Tribe

895
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
to start Chang'an.

896
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,920
It seems that you're good at

897
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,160
discipline.

898
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,760
It's not something

899
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,080
you, a Mobei guard,

900
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
should be in charge of.

901
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:45,260
Because you're the

902
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I want to be with you

903
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
In my dream

904
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Before dawn

905
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Before dawn

906
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
The longing flows

907
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
through my fingers

908
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
There is always

909
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
a moment

910
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
that burns into my heart

911
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
The lies

912
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
There is always

913
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
a moment of longing

914
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
Between you and me

915
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,160
Everything is connected

916
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
In different worlds

917
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
In different worlds

918
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I am still missing you

919
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
I am still missing you

920
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
The deep night

921
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
becomes the eternal night

922
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
The night is empty

923
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
The night is empty

924
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
The night is empty

925
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
The night is empty

926
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
There is always

927
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
a moment

928
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160

There is always

a moment of longing
