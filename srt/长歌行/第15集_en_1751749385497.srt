1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
To the distance

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
The past is bitter

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Where are you looking

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
You are the look of stubbornness

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
To forget the long yearning in the dark night

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Climbing the river of life and the wildness of the past

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Episode 16

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
After today, you are just a slave of my Eagle Division.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
What do you want to do to me?

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I want you to disappear from the Tang Dynasty.

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
I want you to be a slave of my Eagle Division.

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
I want you to be a slave of my Eagle Division.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
I want you to be a slave of my Eagle Division.

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I want you to disappear from the Tang Dynasty.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Whether I die or not, it's up to me.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
What you said is useless.

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
It depends on your ability.

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
You keep me by your side.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
It's just like the Yang Hu.

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
There is no difference.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Wait for you to live first.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Then think about this for me.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The survival rules of the grassland

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Only weak meat and strong food.

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
The Long Ballad

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Behind me

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Is the Shuozhou City that has been robbed and controlled.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
After it

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Is the mountain of the cotton

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
After that

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
The ten thousand miles of the road is my lonely land.

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Chang'an

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I can't go back after all.

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
The Li family is fighting for the country.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Now they are the slaves.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Li Changge

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Even I feel a little sorry for you.

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Received the order from the leader.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I will arrive at home soon.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Please give the order to the leader.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Follow Ashile Tribe immediately.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I want to know how Li Changge is doing in the end.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Kill him?

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
If he is alive

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I will kill him.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
If he colludes with Ashile Tribe

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Kill him.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
If not

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Then Ashile Tribe will not leave him.

56
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Yes

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
If you have any news, pass it to me.

58
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Go down.

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Yes

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
My nephew

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Was killed as if he was a dog.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I am sorry.

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I was born and raised.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I was expelled from the six houses.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I can't live better than death every day.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
But I still have to do what I should do.

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
After this matter is over

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
You kill me again.

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Li Changge

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I hope you can really donate for the people.

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Li Changge

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Recently

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
All the counties

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Are secretly looking for the whereabouts of the princess.

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
But the pictures in the map

76
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Are very similar to the princess.

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
And the four provinces where the princess disappeared

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Until now

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
No news has been passed on.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Your Highness

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Princess Yongan

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Has a good luck and a good fortune.

83
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Li Chunfeng is not counted.

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
He will definitely return safely.

85
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I hope so.

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Recently

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I always dreamed of the happy smoke and Changge when I was a child.

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
The two of them

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Are in the garden.

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I want them to do it.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
But they can't see

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I call their names

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
They can't hear

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
And

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
The farther they go

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Your Highness has been thinking too much recently.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
So

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I had some strange dreams.

99
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Your Highness

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I will go to the budget room

101
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
To stew some soup for you.

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
These two princesses

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Will they be further away from me?

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
No, no.

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
They are still

106
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Your Highness's most considerate daughter and subject.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Maybe there is no news now.

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Is the best news.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Yes, yes.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Your Highness

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Military intelligence report

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Ashile Tribe

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Attacks the north

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
The new army commander Sima Tong

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
The governor of Shuozhou Gongsun Heng

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Have all been ordered

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
When did this happen?

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Why no one reported before?

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Ashile Tribe's army is in the city

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
The border can't send out the war report.

121
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Hao Du sent people to speed up the horse to add the border.

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Lost five horses

123
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
To send the news to Chang'an.

124
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Immediately send troops to the north

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Be sure to drive all Ashile people out of the pass.

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
After that, the army will be stationed in the original place.

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
To comfort the people of the north.

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Yes

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Brother Du

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Brother Du

131
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
There is something to discuss with you.

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Brother Heng has always been very thoughtful.

133
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
What do you want me to discuss?

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Brother Du, don't be so modest.

135
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
We are both court officials.

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
It's good to have a good amount of money.

137
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Besides, this matter

138
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I really need you to help me.

139
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Just say what you want.

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
You also know

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Princess Yongan's disappearance

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Is the biggest stone in the heart of the prince.

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Princess's portrait has been sent to the government.

144
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Secretly checked

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
But never found

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
But only in Beijing

147
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
No news at all

148
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm worried.

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
What do you want me to do?

150
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
People in Beijing

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Never see Princess Rongmou.

152
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Your son is just in Beijing.

153
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Although the little husband of the Wei family

154
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
He said he lost someone.

155
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
But at that time, your son Hao Du

156
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Isn't it also with the princess?

157
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
So one more person

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
One more share

159
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Besides, under your wise guidance

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Your son has long

161
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Just say it.

162
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't be a horse.

163
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Since the prince

164
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Hand this matter to you to deal with

165
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
You can arrange it.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
discussed

167
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Wipe off my mouth

168
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Yo you

169
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,060
Because this kid keeps it

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
What is it for?

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Hot soup is coming.

172
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Let me say it's plating with a knife.

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,260
Yep

174
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,800
Shake it.

175
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Give me another pie

176
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Cake

177
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Where are you going?

178
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
I didn't expect to see you here.

179
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,480
Actually, Eagle Division is not far from Shuozhou.

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
There are many trees near the water source.

181
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
You won't be disappointed.

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,560
Eat something.

183
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Listen,

184
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,120
if Sun Te Qin didn't care about you,

185
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,640
I wouldn't care about you.

186
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
You're so...

187
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,080
I thought he loves you.

188
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,880
You look like a surprisingly insesque man.

189
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,060
But some people

190
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,480
looked down upon you

191
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,760
even when he was just a man,

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,120
say you were so thin.

193
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,240
Dicky?

194
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,560
A thin contender won't last way to go.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,520
Really?

196
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,800
How do you know?

197
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,880
Xiao Xuan's my favouriteиваем for life experience.

198
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
He can't fight me

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
just like that.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,400
But I think you're just a foe to him.

201
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
It doesn't matter.

202
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
You've been so nice to me for so many years.

203
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
The tail behind you has been following us all the way.

204
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I know.

205
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm here to visit the Fourteenth Wolf.

206
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Do me a favor.

207
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
What are you doing?

208
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,800
Let go of me!

209
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Listen,

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
you're our slave.

211
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,800
You have to do whatever you're told to do.

212
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,200
What?

213
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
You're still not willing to work?

214
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,800
I think you're looking for death.

215
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,800
Take her away.

216
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Hide from the dog.

217
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes.

218
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
What are you doing?

219
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,400
Let go of me!

220
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,200
Let go of me!

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Go!

222
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Let go of me!

223
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't move!

224
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,800
Watch out!

225
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Master Qin.

226
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
It's really hard for Madam Qu.

227
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
She's been with us for so long.

228
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
It's not hard.

229
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,400
She has the best father and mother in the world.

230
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
How's it going in Shuozhou?

231
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I've heard everything.

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Ashile Tribe has left.

233
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
The rest of the court will send someone to collect the money.

234
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Besides...

235
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,000
Besides?

236
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,200
You want to tell me about Young Master, right?

237
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
Young Master committed suicide.

238
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,400
He was killed.

239
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
I know.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
He's too cruel.

241
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
He's too cruel.

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If...

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
you don't want this,

244
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,200
I guess Young Master is still alive.

245
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Still alive?

246
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,600
Since Ashile Tribe has an agreement with the priest,

247
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
he won't kill her.

248
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Maybe he's taken to the prairie.

249
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Then let's not wait.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,800
Let's go find him.

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,600
There are their eyes on the prairie.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
How can we just go in and out?

253
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Let's settle Yuanniang first.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Try to use our previous information

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,400
to see if we can get the news and then make a decision.

256
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Li Changge.

258
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
This might be your best place.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Li Changge.

260
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
What are you doing here?

261
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
I should be the one asking.

262
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,600
That's a big thing for you to lose the princess.

263
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
But the crown prince didn't blame you.

264
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
I'll make sure to be the one to blame.

265
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,400
I'll be waiting.

266
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,680
You haven't come back to Chang'an for so long.

267
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,920
Are you looking for Changge?

268
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,120
What happened to her?

269
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,840
She's dead.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,840
How?

271
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,520
You killed her?

272
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,040
Tell me!

273
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,320
Wei Shuyu,

274
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,800
are you going to avenge your lover

275
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,640
and disregard your family's life?

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,920
I killed you

277
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,560
to atone for my sin.

278
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Do you think His Highness

279
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
will die for your family?

280
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,680
Then why don't you kill her?

281
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,840
You were helpless when Li Changge was alive.

282
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,000
Now you have the courage to seek revenge after you're dead.

283
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,000
I think

284
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,440
you only know Li Changge's death

285
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,520
and your family's glory

286
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,560
will be ruined.

287
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,800
Even if you want to avenge your lover,

288
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
you've found the wrong person.

289
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,280
I didn't kill Li Changge.

290
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
Ashile Tribe's men killed her.

291
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,160
Ashile Tribe?

292
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,200
Ashile Tribe captured Shuozhou.

293
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,840
Li Changge was captured.

294
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,680
With her strong temper,

295
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,080
do you think she can survive?

296
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,880
You!

297
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,680
The one who chased me

298
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,000
was you.

299
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,920
From now on,

300
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,040
we have nothing to do with each other.

301
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,440
From now on,

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,320
I'll go on my own.

303
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,640
What's the use of giving me

304
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
the protection of the God of War?

305
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,680
In the end,

306
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,240
I didn't protect you.

307
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,480
Enough.

308
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
Li Changge is no longer here.

309
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,280
Don't let anything happen to Her Highness.

310
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,440
Also,

311
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,240
I received a message from Chang'an.

312
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,840
They told me to stay in Beijing

313
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,760
to find Her Highness.

314
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,040
Apparently,

315
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,840
they don't trust you.

316
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
I'll find Her Highness before you do.

317
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,000
It doesn't matter.

318
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,600
I don't believe I can compete with you.

319
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
But I can give you some hints.

320
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
Li Changge is the best

321
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
and most powerful commander of Qingche in Shuozhou.

322
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
If Her Highness is in Shuozhou,

323
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
she'll leave a trace.

324
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,360
So you came to Shuozhou

325
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,040
by mistake.

326
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,360
Come on.

327
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,400
It's your fault.

328
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,360
Come on.

329
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,840
It'll be better if they kill Leng Xiao Sitou herself.

330
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,720
What happened last night?

331
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,480
Let me go!

332
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Go!

333
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,360
Let me go!

334
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,080
Go!

335
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,440
Go!

336
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,160
Behave yourself!

337
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,160
Hurry up!

338
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,560
Which play did Ashile Sun perform?

339
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,400
I don't understand it either.

340
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
If it were me,

341
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,840
I would have been impatient.

342
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
You, a slave,

343
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,840
are already challenging

344
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,120
the bottom line of Eagle Division soldiers.

345
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,440
I let you suffer.

346
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
You really don't know how powerful you are.

347
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,240
You're so soft-hearted.

348
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,960
I don't know what you're bringing back.

349
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,360
Go.

350
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,760
Sir, please.

351
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,160
Excuse me.

352
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,720
Are you from the Ming family?

353
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,080
Where are you from, wild girl?

354
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,880
You don't even know the Ming family.

355
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I have something to ask you.

356
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,480
How dare you!

357
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,760
You don't know the rules.

358
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,160
You have work to do.

359
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,880
Step aside.

360
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,080
Ming family?

361
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
You're the parent of Yunzhou.

362
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,120
If I didn't have something urgent to ask,

363
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
I wouldn't have been so rude.

364
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,200
Go.

365
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,400
You want to be framed?

366
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,440
Go to the chicken valley.

367
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,920
What do you want?

368
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,880
Listen to me.

369
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,760
My identity is not convenient to say.

370
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,640
But if you're convenient,

371
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,720
can you help me

372
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,200
send a message to Chang'an

373
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,280
or Luoyang?

374
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,360
What's your identity?

375
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm Princess Yong'an.

376
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,000
I left the city

377
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,800
and fled here after I became a magistrate.

378
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,600
Ming family,

379
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,440
if you can help me return to the capital,

380
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
His Majesty will reward you.

381
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,320
Do you have any proof?

382
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,200
Proof?

383
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,320
I don't have any

384
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,880
proof for now.

385
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,080
But I'm really a princess.

386
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,480
I was sealed by His Majesty.

387
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,800
Do you have any personal items in the palace?

388
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
You can know it by looking at the work in the palace.

389
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,440
They were all taken away.

390
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,880
How did you know?

391
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
You're so smart.

392
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
The court gave an order

393
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,320
to secretly search for a princess.

394
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,800
But you said you were.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
You're the one.

396
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,520
I knew my father would send someone to find me.

397
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,360
Ming family,

398
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm really a princess.

399
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,120
Believe me.

400
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,880
It's true.

401
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,240
Ming family, please.

402
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,920
Help me send a message to Luoyang.

403
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,800
You're pretending to be a princess.

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm really a princess.

405
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,080
Take her down.

406
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,880
Yes.

407
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,760
Ming family.

408
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
Ming family.

409
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,400
Why don't you believe me?

410
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,320
What are you waiting for?

411
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,080
Take her down.

412
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,600
All right.

413
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,640
Let her go.

414
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,360
You're a poor girl who can't be trusted.

415
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,400
It's a big mess now.

416
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,160
The new governor is coming soon.

417
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,120
I don't have time to deal with the refugees.

418
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,640
Be careful.

419
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,480
Ming family.

420
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,160
A'Yi.

421
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,600
Why don't you come to pick me up?

422
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,560
Don't you want me?

423
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll go pick you up.

424
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,360
What a tough boy.

425
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,040
If you're too�� and don't have enough power to defend yourself.

426
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,480
Just go to the Creative Corps.

427
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,440
but he's ignoring her and being bullied.

428
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,880
It's getting more and more strange.

429
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
The more I care about her,

430
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
the more she'll suffer.

431
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,320
Instead of hating herself,

432
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,920
why don't you just hate me?

433
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,600
You're really strange.

434
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,600
Did she make a fool of you?

435
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,320
I can show you to Wuyi.

436
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
I think you want to get a horse's dung too.

437
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,680
What?

438
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,680
I'm a military counselor of Eagle Division.

439
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,400
Can you save my face?

440
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,320
She has to rely on her own strength

441
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
to stand firm in Eagle Division.

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll have a time when I can't see her.

443
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,440
Isn't she just a smart and smart

444
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Central Plains person?

445
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,000
Is it worth it?

446
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,320
I don't think she's grateful to you at all.

447
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,280
I don't need her to be grateful.

448
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,120
I just hope she can live on.

449
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,240
Tegin, military counselor.

450
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,120
Tell the slave I'm watching

451
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,120
that she fainted.

452
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,320
You're so anxious for Shuozhou.

453
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
You didn't eat or drink on the way.

454
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,920
I think you don't want to live anymore.

455
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,320
What?

456
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,520
Are you afraid of what I do to you?

457
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm not interested in women like you.

458
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,720
Why are you...

459
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,040
I knew it when I saved you by the river.

460
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
I saw you trying to hide it.

461
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,040
I didn't want to expose you.

462
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,880
You've been playing tricks on me.

463
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,240
Whatever you want.

464
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,840
Tegin, this is the medicine and...

465
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,840
Tegin.

466
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,960
My doctor said you're bronchitis

467
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,440
and Hang Piення atrophy said youardon.

468
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,560
If you don't want to die,

469
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,680
take the medicine.

470
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,840
Take.

471
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Li Shisi, I didn't expect you to be so weak.

472
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,200
I've already fulfilled my promise

473
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
to the people of Shuozhou.

474
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,760
Now it's your turn.

475
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,320
Don't forget that

476
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,120
your life is mine.

477
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,640
It's ridiculous.

478
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,920
You asked a Central Plainer to come and serve you.

479
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Why don't you kill me early

480
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,200
so that you won't have to chase Moqi back in the future?

481
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
I'll say it again for the last time.

482
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Take the medicine.

483
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,280
Take the medicine for the last time.

484
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,840
Is this the only way you can solve the problem?

485
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,240
That's better than my life now.

486
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
Since my life is in your hands,

487
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,880
why should you humiliate me like this?

488
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,560
Humiliate me?

489
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,840
I just don't want you to die so easily.

490
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,680
Li Shisi,

491
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,840
I advise you to find a way to survive.

492
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,640
Even if it's for one day, you can kill me.

493
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
One day, you can avenge Gongsun Heng.

494
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,040
Avenge?

495
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,240
Yes.

496
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,880
Avenge.

497
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
Gongsun Heng's revenge.

498
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
Have you forgotten the revenge of the people of Shuozhou?

499
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,560
Gongsun Heng is ridiculous.

500
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,880
He wants to entrust a descendant to a coward like you.

501
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,600
If I were you,

502
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,360
I would have tried to find a way to get a foothold in Eagle Division.

503
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,520
I would have taken the trust of the other party at all costs

504
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,000
and killed them all in four levels.

505
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,040
If you really want to do him justice,

506
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,560
just bite your teeth and live.

507
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,120
To give the lives of the people of Shuozhou

508
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,040
to the princess of Tang,

509
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,440
it's a good choice for me.

510
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,520
The city is still protected by the people.

511
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,880
I can't let them down.

512
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,280
But I have to let my own daughter down.

513
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
A'Dou!

514
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,680
It's not only Gongsun Heng's revenge.

515
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,200
It's not only Shuozhou's.

516
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,520
Yes.

517
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
How can I die like this?

518
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,520
How can I die here?

519
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,560
It's easy to die.

520
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,440
It's the most difficult thing to live.

521
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Go.

522
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,160
Go.

523
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,720
Don't go there.

524
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
I just came from there.

525
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,760
I'm not there.

526
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,080
Go to the left.

527
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,040
Go to the Cloud.

528
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,160
This is the place of the palace of Ming.

529
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,520
You can't break in.

530
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,280
Ming.

531
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm here to see the princess.

532
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,920
Do you need any help?

533
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,480
What can I do for you?

534
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,640
Just tell me.

535
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,360
Send the guards

536
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,760
to all the places of the palace of Ming.

537
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,320
Find the woman on the painting.

538
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,240
Yes.

539
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,440
inconvenient joining

540
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:36,920
This is…

541
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,040
This is…

542
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,320
You see her?

543
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,520
Where is she?

544
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,840
The women could but heard that,

545
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,920
none of them could prove

546
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,320
their identities.

547
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,600
I – I think she has murdered the people they know.

548
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,720
You think she involved the man?

549
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,880
Li Wenxiang.

550
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,880
You can quickly have a look.

551
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,880
I thought he was a refugee

552
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
So I sent him away

553
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Find him out even if you have to

554
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Yes

555
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Lady Chen, where are you going?

556
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Go for a walk

557
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I'm leaving

558
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
You embroidered too much

559
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
You should embroider more to make money

560
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Okay, I got it

561
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Sister-in-law Xiang

562
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
How's the incense?

563
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
It's good

564
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
You should burn more incense

565
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,840
I want to see the

566
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Jiang Er is out

567
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Yes

568
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Give me three

569
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
So many people

570
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
How can you divide them?

571
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Nonsense

572
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,840
They are good at eating

573
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
But they want to eat the sesame cake

574
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Hurry up, I'm hungry

575
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Okay, wait a moment

576
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
I know

577
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Look at this

578
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
This is not a restaurant

579
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
You can get food from other places

580
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I have money

581
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
I want to buy a cake

582
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
You scared me

583
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Three yuan for one

584
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
It's more expensive than the money

585
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
The ice is full of ice

586
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Food is expensive everywhere

587
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Here is your cake

588
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Lady Chen

589
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,880
You don't have to buy a cake

590
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Lady Chen

591
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm a decent person

592
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Three yuan for one cake

593
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
I don't want to pay for the rest

594
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
No

595
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
I'm afraid someone will take it away

596
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
I put the bag on the bottom

597
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Okay

598
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
You don't know how to do it

599
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
What?

600
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
This bag is ugly

601
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
I think this bag

602
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,880
is the most beautiful bag in the world

603
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Okay, wait a moment

604
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Here is your cake

605
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Thank you

606
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Okay

607
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Sorry

608
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
It's okay

609
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
It's okay

610
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
It's dirtier than this

611
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
If you don't mind

612
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
I'll share it with you

613
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
I'll share it with you

614
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm not mean

615
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,880
People are bullied these days

616
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I want to share my own bag

617
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
with him

618
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
He is a fool

619
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Come and have a look

620
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
My bag

621
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
My bag

622
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Stop

623
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Stop

624
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
My bag

625
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Stop

626
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Stop

627
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Stop

628
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Give me back my bag

629
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
You can take it away

630
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Here you are

631
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
So ugly

632
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
What is this?

633
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I broke it to make this hand

634
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
You think it's ugly?

635
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Forget it

636
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
I won't give it to you

637
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
It's a little ugly

638
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
But I like it

639
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Changge

640
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Where are you?

641
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Have you seen the woman in the portrait?

642
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
No

643
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Have you seen this woman?

644
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
No

645
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Have you seen this woman in the portrait?

646
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
No

647
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Have you seen her?

648
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
No

649
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
You

650
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
I haven't seen her

651
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
She is going to catch me

652
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
You

653
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Stop

654
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Chase

655
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Stop

656
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Stop

657
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Stop

658
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Stop

659
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Don't run

660
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Chase

661
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
You

662
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
Stop

663
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Why do you follow me,

664
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
if you lost your money?

665
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
They want to capture me

666
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
What did you do?

667
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
They want to capture me

668
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
I did nothing

669
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
They said I pretended to be the princess

670
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
Are you stupid?

671
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,520
I didn't kidnap the princess.

672
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,280
I...

673
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,960
Open the door.

674
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,240
Open the door.

675
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,800
Coming.

676
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,520
Open the door.

677
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,320
Open the door.

678
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,480
It's daytime.

679
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,880
Why are you in a hurry?

680
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
Are you going to buy cloth?

681
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,120
We're chasing a girl.

682
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,880
We saw her walking on this street.

683
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,880
Have you seen her?

684
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,960
She's the one in the painting.

685
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I saw her.

686
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,040
This girl

687
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,080
was robbed by a thief

688
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,360
in the street earlier.

689
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,280
She ran south after the thief.

690
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,920
Sir,

691
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,680
what did this little girl do?

692
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,720
She's not a robber.

693
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,800
We're in a bad situation.

694
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,440
Let's go.

695
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,960
Sir.

696
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,960
What's going on?

697
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,120
I don't know.

698
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,240
What's going on?

699
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,280
It's so late!

700
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,080
Wake up!

701
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,120
Let's go!

702
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,280
No.

703
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,240
No.

704
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,960
They didn't come here.

705
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,440
Did I say this?

706
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,880
I do have business here.

707
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,640
People like you

708
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,320
Search anything you want.

709
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,920
Remember to inform us.

710
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
I will.

711
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,080
Let's go.

712
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,160
You're smart.

713
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,280
You know how to hide in the water tank.

714
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Thank you, Madam.

715
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,440
I thought you wouldn't save me.

716
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,440
All right.

717
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,480
You don't look like a bad person.

718
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,120
You're so nosy.

719
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,000
You're pretending to be a princess.

720
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,920
You're so mean.

721
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,720
Madam, I'm not pretending.

722
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm really a princess.

723
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,280
All right.

724
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,520
You're a princess or a master.

725
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,520
I'm busy.

726
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,400
You should go.

727
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,040
Madam, if I go out now,

728
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,440
I'll be dead.

729
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm begging you.

730
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,280
Let me stay here for a day.

731
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,840
I'm begging you.

732
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
All right.

733
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,080
Go back and change your clothes.

734
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,280
Don't come to me.

735
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,320
Thank you, Madam.

736
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840
So this is the grassland.

737
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
It's really vast.

738
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Madam Su Yuli.

739
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,680
Do you have any milk?

740
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,720
Remember to leave some for me.

741
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Yes.

742
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,360
You can eat enough at Madam's tent.

743
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,400
Deqian, have you prepared a gift for us?

744
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,520
Yes.

745
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,160
Everyone has a gift.

746
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,360
Yalu.

747
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,440
Deqian, the medicine is dried.

748
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,360
I brought it here.

749
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
What do you think?

750
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,960
Not bad.

751
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,360
Deqian.

752
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,000
Look.

753
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,840
Take it yourself.

754
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,960
A gift.

755
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,160
I want this.

756
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,520
This is good.

757
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,640
Look.

758
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,400
Let me see.

759
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,160
Uncle.

760
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,640
Where's my reward?

761
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,280
My reward.

762
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,400
Stand still.

763
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,320
Stand still.

764
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,000
Close your eyes.

765
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,600
Close your eyes.

766
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,800
My gift, Uncle.

767
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,400
My gift.

768
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,840
I only have one horse.

769
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,760
Good.

770
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,800
I can give you a big one.

771
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,600
Aunt.

772
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Give it to me.

773
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,920
Aunt.

774
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,920
Aunt.

775
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,720
Uncle.

776
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,080
Aunt, don't be lazy.

777
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,920
Aunt.

778
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
Uncle.

779
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,400
Give it to me, Uncle.

780
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,960
You promised me.

781
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,640
Here.

782
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,440
Let me help you.

783
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,040
Not bad.

784
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,440
It's fun.

785
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,840
You're good at playing soccer.

786
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,360
This is for you.

787
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,240
Brother.

788
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,920
Let's play the ball.

789
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,240
Here.

790
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,760
Let's go.

791
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,440
Let's go.

792
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,080
Let's go.

793
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,800
Slow down.

794
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,360
Let's go.

795
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,080
Let's go.

796
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,760
Let's go.

797
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Let's go.

798
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,320
Let me take the gifts for him.

799
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,040
Take them.

800
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,120
The moon money for this year is too little.

801
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,880
Madam Zhang, you're content with it, right?

802
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,320
We have a living source anyway.

803
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,680
We don't have to starve to death.

804
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,960
It's not bad.

805
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,480
You're right.

806
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,040
Isn't the machine getting more and more difficult to use?

807
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,280
Yes.

808
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,480
Madam Chai,

809
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
you're finally willing to make another contribution.

810
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
I picked them up on the way.

811
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,480
I'll leave tonight.

812
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,080
Greetings, ladies.

813
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,360
What are you looking at?

814
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Get back to work.

815
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,080
This lady is really pretty.

816
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,160
What was that gift she gave you when she woke up?

817
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
What gift?

818
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I don't know.

819
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,680
It looks pretty.

820
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
That's right.

821
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,200
Greetings, ladies.

822
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
It's not like that.

823
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
It's like that.

824
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Who said it's like that?

825
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
It's her.

826
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
You just stay here.

827
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,680
You have to leave tomorrow.

828
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
I don't have time to spare.

829
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,160
Thank you, madam.

830
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
I will repay you in the future.

831
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Thank you then.

832
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
What should I do tomorrow?

833
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
What did the Cloud Manor say just now?

834
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
I didn't hear it clearly.

835
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Sir,

836
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm the Empress.

837
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
The Palace Hall

838
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
was lost.

839
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
You told me that you didn't find it.

840
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
That's fine.

841
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
What do you mean by lost?

842
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
We were on the street.

843
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
We saw a woman who looked like her.

844
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,160
But she ran away.

845
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
What woman?

846
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Why did she run away?

847
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Sir,

848
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
we will continue to look for her.

849
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
But the Princess,

850
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
she has a foot.

851
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Is she still in the Cloud Manor?

852
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
We don't know yet.

853
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
You still dare to take responsibility?

854
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Yes.

855
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
We will continue to look for her.

856
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
I will look for her tomorrow.

857
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Get lost.

858
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Okay.

859
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Ye'er,

860
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
where are you?

861
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160

In different worlds.

949
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
In different worlds.

950
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160
In different worlds.

951
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
In different worlds.

952
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm missing you day and night.

953
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,160
I just want to be with you.

954
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
Don't be forever.

955
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,160
In the dark night.

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,160
I miss you.
