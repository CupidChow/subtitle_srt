1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is broken

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Forgetting

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The memory of this old song

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm stubborn

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Looking back at the past

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He is the river of life

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Don't forget the crazy

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The long ballad

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Gongsun Heng

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Waiter

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Bring us some wine

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And some food

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Gongsun Heng

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No wonder even the children are imitating him

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It seems that he has gained a lot of people's hearts

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sir, please enjoy

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Waiter

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell me more about this Gongsun Heng

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Gongsun Heng of Shuozhou

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Gongsun Heng

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He worked here in the past

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
These years

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He has organized us here

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
High city, strong city, strong army, strong horse

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The people of the lake are beautiful

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Can't stand a little advantage

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Gongsun Heng is generous

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Caused countless people to come to vote

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The Zhou County near the city is the most prosperous in our state

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Our shopkeeper said

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Any guests from outside

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All our seductive smoked chicken

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A little smoked chicken is not worth a few money

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can't we lose the face of Gongsun Heng?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are right

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Waiter

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm busy

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Call me if you need anything

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Guests

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Please come inside

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is there a seat?

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Legend has it that the guardian is a general

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The most despised person in this kind of person should be a warrior

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The most despised person in this kind of person should be a warrior

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How can I persuade him to start a war?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do not be afraid

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now I'm more descriptions

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now I'm more descriptions

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Do you know my reason why he attacked my master?

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you know my reason why he attacked my master?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you know my reason why he attacked my master?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is the way to greet him

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do not avoid them

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Please leave

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Come

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Get out

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,200
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,720
Okay.

82
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,120
I knew my master was the living Buddha in my life.

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
With you, I have everything.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,760
By the way, master.

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
Are we going to run for the local official now?

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,640
Just like Youzhou.

87
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,120
We should be generous to him and let him start the army.

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,840
Youzhou is my father's new home.

89
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm not afraid of the general.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
Gongsun Heng is an old friend of the previous dynasty.

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,360
Why didn't he help us?

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,480
In this world,

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
no one is trustworthy anymore.

94
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,040
Master.

95
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,080
What about Dou?

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
Is he trustworthy?

97
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,600
Yes.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,560
Dou.

99
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,800
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
It's more boring

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
than being cheated

102
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,480
by others.

103
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,120
Master.

104
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,080
Why can't I understand?

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,160
You'd better never understand.

106
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

107
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,400
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

108
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,880
After that,

109
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,840
I'll take you to the poorest place in Shuozhou.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Master will teach you the first lesson.

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
You'll get the information.

112
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,040
Ye Hom vil sub Spread the data

113
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,560
Samen is back.

114
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Samen is back.

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
increÃ­ble

116
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,320
simen

117
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,040
You're back.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,120
You got hurt.

119
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Very long story.

120
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,040
Well.

121
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,680
Yeah, boy.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,280
How dare he please you now.

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
If I die in the Tang Empire,

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
she can cover up on herself.

125
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
In the case of me,

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
I'll not let it go.

127
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,520
There's already a huge risk for her.

128
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,400
What if she accuses him of this?

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,400
That won't happen.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I know her character well.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,060
It's impossible.

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
If you want to rob me,

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,360
you have to bear the consequences.

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Who made this for you?

135
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,160
What a mess.

136
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,320
If you change it to someone else,

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,840
you'll be badly injured.

138
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,640
Why are you laughing?

139
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,280
Nothing.

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,880
Are you hiding something from me?

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,960
Keep your distance.

142
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
The lady of Tang State made this?

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
Tegin, Tu Kashe is here.

144
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,960
He's outside the gate.

145
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,080
Why is the leader of the Bear Division here?

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
He should be here.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes.

148
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,360
I haven't transferred...

149
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
You're still alive.

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm very relieved.

151
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Your eyes are hurt?

152
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I'll let go if I have a scar.

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Don't be so mean to me.

154
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Do you think I want to come?

155
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Great Khan

156
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
asked us to go south

157
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
just to accompany you to Shuozhou.

158
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
In case you guys fail.

159
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
I'll report to you.

160
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Anything else?

161
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Yes.

162
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
The order of Great Khan.

163
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Great Khan

164
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
asked our Bear Division to be responsible for this mission.

165
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
This time,

166
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I, Bear Division, will be responsible.

167
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
So,

168
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
you, Eagle Division,

169
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
will report to me

170
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
about your every move.

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
When you do things,

172
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
you should think about the source.

173
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
About your Bear Division,

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
do you also report to us?

175
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
No.

176
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
You can go back.

177
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Where did you say?

178
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I said that

179
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Balu said he could do great work.

180
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
He wants to join the hunting next year.

181
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
And Gesang wants to learn riding.

182
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
He doesn't agree.

183
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
That's right.

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Why does a girl want to learn riding?

185
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I'll go to see her later.

186
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Tell her I agree.

187
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
You agree?

188
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Enough.

189
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm leaving.

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
See you.

191
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
It seems that

192
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
someone is talking about you.

193
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Tu Kashe never accepts you.

194
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
He said he was here to help.

195
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
He said he was here to steal the credit.

196
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
He even used his toes to think about

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
who was behind it.

198
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
If he was wronged once,

199
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
he would have quit.

200
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
He is not a boy.

201
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
By the way,

202
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
you said you agreed

203
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
that a girl wants to learn riding.

204
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Yes.

205
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I agree.

206
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Qin Lang.

207
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
The army of Ashile Tribe

208
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
is here.

209
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
It's fierce.

210
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
If we send troops to guard

211
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
the northwest and northeast corners of the city,

212
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
and the whole city,

213
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
we will be in a defensive position.

214
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
What do you think?

215
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
You are very good at using troops.

216
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
You are very good at using troops.

217
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm not a man.

218
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm a man.

219
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm a man.

220
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm a man.

221
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
I'm a man.

222
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
I'm a man.

223
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
I'm a man.

224
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I'm a man.

225
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
I'm a man.

226
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm a man.

227
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm a man.

228
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
I'm a man.

229
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
I'm a man.

230
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Well done.

231
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,640
This time, We'll lose to Ashile Tribe.

232
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,740
Althoughã

233
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
we are outnumbered.

234
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm afraid that

235
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,640
I have no means

236
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
to make amends

237
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
for the whole situation.

238
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Commander.

239
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
It was bad.

240
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,400
Something bad happened.

241
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,280
Tell me.

242
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,240
Madam and Madam Yuan

243
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,600
met bandits on their way to the temple.

244
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,440
What?

245
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,480
We found the damaged carriage

246
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,840
and the body of the carer on the road.

247
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,480
Get up.

248
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,840
Where are Madam and Madam Yuan now?

249
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,000
We didn't find them.

250
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,040
Didn't find them?

251
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
Those bandits

252
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,480
are at this time.

253
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,440
Send my order.

254
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,800
The Northern Qi people

255
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,520
go up the mountain with me to fight the bandits.

256
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,960
We must save Madam and Madam Yuan.

257
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,960
Yes.

258
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,000
My husband.

259
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,800
Madam.

260
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Madam, are you all right?

261
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm fine.

262
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,560
Thanks to you two,

263
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,800
we can get rid of the bandits.

264
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
You two?

265
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Yan Niang.

266
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Are you all right?

267
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
Good boy.

268
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,480
How are you?

269
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,960
Madam, I'm fine.

270
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
You're fine?

271
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,680
Good boy.

272
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,440
My husband.

273
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
These two are the benefactors.

274
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,320
I want to thank you two for your help.

275
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll try my best to repay you.

276
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
Thank you.

277
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,960
Thank you.

278
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,600
Thank you.

279
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,240
Thank you.

280
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,840
Thank you.

281
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,560
Thank you.

282
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,160
Thank you.

283
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,840
Thank you.

284
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Thank you.

285
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,200
Thank you.

286
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,240
I'm the Fourteenth Prince.

287
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,600
This is Doudou.

288
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
Because of an emergency,

289
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,360
I had to trick Madam to go with me.

290
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,440
Trick?

291
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,240
In that case,

292
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,280
please be polite.

293
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
Doudou and I

294
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,560
traveled from Longxi to here.

295
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,440
We happened to be in a small place.

296
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
My brother fell asleep because he was too tired.

297
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
When I was about to wake him up

298
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
and drive him away,

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,800
I heard a few bandits around.

300
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,400
I discussed with them.

301
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,520
Doudou.

302
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Doudou.

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,440
You're awake. It's time to go.

304
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,280
Come on.

305
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,160
Come on.

306
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,720
Someone's here.

307
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,280
Come on.

308
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,680
I've checked the island.

309
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,200
Gongsun He's daughter is ill.

310
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,440
Her mother-in-law

311
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
will definitely come here

312
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,440
to pray to Buddha.

313
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,800
We must fight back

314
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
and take her down.

315
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,240
Gongsun, that old man,

316
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,600
has cut off our way.

317
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,040
He has done so much for us.

318
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,680
I'm already a man

319
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,360
if I don't kill his mother-in-law.

320
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Let's go. Get ready.

321
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,840
How did you save my wife

322
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
and Yuan'er?

323
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
Actually, Doudou and I

324
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,240
are left-handed.

325
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,920
We can't fight with bandits

326
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
and we can't report it to the governor in time.

327
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,120
So we can only lie.

328
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
The King's Mansion

329
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,720
They're coming.

330
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,760
There are...

331
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,360
Let's go.

332
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,960
Move aside.

333
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,320
Move aside.

334
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,320
Move aside.

335
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,440
Move aside.

336
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,000
Stop.

337
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,640
Do you need a ride?

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Thank you, Madam.

339
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,720
My brother hasn't recovered

340
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,520
after half a month.

341
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,160
The monk in the temple said

342
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,640
he had to walk to the temple

343
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,960
to be sincere.

344
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,280
I can't bear my brother

345
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,520
to suffer from the illness.

346
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,120
But he can only walk to the temple.

347
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
Really?

348
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
Of course.

349
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,440
Wait for me at the gate of the temple.

350
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,840
I'll walk to the temple with these two young men.

351
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,240
Madam, this...

352
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,120
The doctors in the city have checked it.

353
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,720
But Yuanniang's cough

354
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
is still not getting better.

355
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm going to beg the Bodhisattva for blessings.

356
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,320
This young man is right.

357
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,280
It's more dangerous to walk to the temple step by step.

358
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,280
You go.

359
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,480
Yes, Madam.

360
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm tired.

361
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,120
Madam,

362
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,560
let me hold the young lady.

363
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,360
Why bother the young man?

364
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,680
It's okay. I'm strong.

365
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,480
Come on.

366
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,400
Come on.

367
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,000
Let's go.

368
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,120
Let's go together.

369
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Thank you, Madam.

370
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,880
The only reason I can lie to you

371
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
is Yuanniang.

372
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,240
Because

373
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,960
in this world,

374
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,520
no mother would sacrifice

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
for her child.

376
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,600
I can't repay you for saving my life.

377
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,560
You're being too serious.

378
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
Because Shisi's mother

379
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,920
is like you.

380
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,960
She would do everything for Shisi.

381
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,560
Indeed.

382
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,520
If you had changed your mind,

383
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
I wouldn't have gotten off the bus.

384
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,240
But I didn't expect

385
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,960
it would ruin the life of the carer.

386
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,120
I'm sorry for the carer.

387
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,280
The carer was killed

388
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,440
because you didn't expect it.

389
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,120
I can only blame those bandits for being ruthless.

390
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,360
It's okay.

391
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,600
You've done a good job.

392
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Qin,

393
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,080
tell them

394
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,640
to bury the carer

395
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
and take care of his family.

396
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,880
Yes.

397
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Young Hero,

398
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,320
you're a hero.

399
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
But is it

400
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,960
really just a coincidence?

401
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,080
I...

402
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,320
Qushan.

403
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,680
What's wrong?

404
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,640
I've been stricken.

405
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
Are you all right?

406
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,600
I didn't know

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you Ð±Ñat this.

408
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,720
I see,

409
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,320
after father went into the Chimavala,

410
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,160
I have to return to my village now.

411
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Your Highness.

412
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
You saved Madam and Yuan'er

413
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
to come here to receive rewards?

414
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Yes.

415
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Shisi did have a selfish motive.

416
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,120
But my selfish motive is to follow the Chief of Ji's clan.

417
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Do you think that you saved Madam and Yuan'er

418
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
and I will leave you two with me?

419
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Do you want to leave me with you?

420
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Shisi,

421
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Shisi's father was a general of Xiangjiang.

422
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
He was a man of no importance.

423
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Before he died, he told Shisi

424
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
to go to the border to fight for his fame.

425
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Besides, saving Madam and Yuan'er

426
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
was not just a coincidence.

427
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Isn't this the chance for me and Shisi?

428
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,120
What a smart young man.

429
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Please rise.

430
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
My husband,

431
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
after Shisi became a general,

432
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
he saved me and Yuan'er.

433
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
They are far away from each other.

434
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Since they are not related,

435
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
why don't you...

436
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Thank you for your kindness.

437
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Since you two

438
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
are the saviors of Madam and Yuan'er,

439
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
how can I do anything to drive you away?

440
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Since you are willing to stay,

441
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
I will arrange you to meet in the backyard.

442
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
We will discuss the future later.

443
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Thank you, Shisi.

444
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,120
I haven't slept in such a comfortable bed for a long time.

445
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Master,

446
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
we can do it now.

447
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Gongsun Heng loves his wife.

448
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
He will treat us well.

449
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
But if we want to gain Gongsun Heng's trust,

450
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
it's not a good thing.

451
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Then why did he keep us in the mansion?

452
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
It's all because of Madam.

453
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
So he still doubts us.

454
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
At least he doesn't trust us.

455
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,120
There is only one layer of the poison in the heart.

456
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
He will not be unaware of it.

457
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Anyway,

458
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
after the plan of my master,

459
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
we have succeeded in completing the first step of the plan.

460
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Next,

461
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
how to gain Gongsun Heng's trust,

462
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
control the military power,

463
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
and then start the army.

464
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Don't tell me the secret in your heart.

465
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Master.

466
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
What do you think?

467
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
You two saved Madam and Yuan Ning.

468
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Just by this,

469
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
you caught Master's weakness.

470
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
These two young men are smart,

471
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
and brave.

472
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,120
But they also have some clever and cunning.

473
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Master, don't worry.

474
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,120
I will pay extra attention.

475
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Now the situation is turbulent.

476
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
The war is starting.

477
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
We are also in need of people.

478
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
If what Zhenru and the two of them said

479
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
is just to gain a reputation,

480
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
it's also a good thing.

481
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
But

482
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
we still have to be careful.

483
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Since you haven't known the result,

484
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
then we will wait and see.

485
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
As for the peace in the mansion,

486
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Master, don't worry.

487
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I will do my best to guard it.

488
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Isn't this Sun Teqin?

489
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
What's up?

490
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Let me ask Sun Teqin.

491
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Shuozhou is right in front of us.

492
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
When do you plan to attack?

493
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Attack or not,

494
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
when to attack,

495
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I will consider it.

496
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Just such a small city,

497
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
how long do you have to consider?

498
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Are you afraid?

499
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
This small city,

500
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
even the Shule Khan

501
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
couldn't get the advantage.

502
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
You can do it.

503
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
That was the time

504
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
when the Shule Khan had no strong army.

505
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I was here.

506
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I don't know how many

507
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
soldiers are there

508
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
in this kind of city.

509
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
If the attack fails,

510
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
will the Bear Division take the initiative?

511
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Why did the attack fail?

512
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
You haven't attacked yet.

513
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Why should we take the initiative?

514
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
In this city,

515
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
the Bear Division will take the initiative.

516
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
You should cooperate.

517
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
If the Bear Division cooperates well,

518
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
it won't fail.

519
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
I'm looking forward to the Bear Division's performance.

520
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Good.

521
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Go prepare two sets of clothes for the people from the Central Plains.

522
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
You want to go to Shuozhou in person?

523
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Know yourself,

524
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
and you will not fail.

525
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Go.

526
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Good boy.

527
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Come on, let me hug you.

528
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Yuanniang.

529
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Let's go back.

530
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Brother.

531
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Madam made a delicious cake for you.

532
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Brother.

533
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
What's going on?

534
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Are you trying to keep us safe?

535
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Nothing wrong with that.

536
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Let's go out for a walk.

537
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Maybe we will discover something new.

538
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Are we going to find bandits again to find out the information?

539
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
I...

540
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Don't ever mention something again.

541
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Your Highness, the city is in a panic.

542
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
People are fighting because they are not in the right place.

543
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
They are all arguing to see you.

544
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
This kind of small thing

545
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
doesn't need to bother you.

546
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
This is not a small thing.

547
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
I want to divide the land in the city into several parts.

548
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
I will divide the men in the family.

549
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
The rest will be managed by the government.

550
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
After the children in the family are adults,

551
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
they can be divided again.

552
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
What do you think?

553
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Do as he said.

554
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Yes.

555
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Good morning, Your Highness.

556
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
You know the politics and the martial arts?

557
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
A little.

558
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
When did you learn it?

559
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
My father was a local official.

560
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
He was a man of the heart.

561
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Okay. I want to ask you.

562
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
In Shuozhou,

563
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
there are businessmen who trade with the fox merchants.

564
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
What do you think?

565
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
There is no communication with the outside world.

566
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Each takes what they need.

567
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
It is to promote the survival.

568
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
In fact, it is not right to kill all the people.

569
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,120
But to regulate the number of items in the trade,

570
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
it is not necessary to be too strict

571
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
from the general control.

572
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
The actual situation is allowed.

573
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
You can judge it yourself.

574
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
If I hadn't heard it myself,

575
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I really can't believe

576
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
that it came from you.

577
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
You are too modest.

578
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Compared with you,

579
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I am just a second.

580
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Where are you going?

581
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
A'Dou and I are going out of Shuozhou.

582
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
We are going out for a walk.

583
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
We want to see what's new.

584
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
We want to know about Feng Tuo's character.

585
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Okay. You can go.

586
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Yes.

587
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
You heard it?

588
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Yes.

589
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
How is it?

590
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
You always care about talent.

591
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,120
I'm afraid you are worried about it.

592
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Yes.

593
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
If all the officials I have

594
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
have such a brain,

595
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
I have to save a lot of time every day.

596
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Mr. Qin.

597
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Go and have a look.

598
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Yes.

599
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Your Highness.

600
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
This time,

601
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,120
you can't be too kind.

602
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Duke.

603
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
The plum blossom cake that the Crown Princess Consort just made.

604
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Have a taste.

605
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Wei Zheng just arrived in the city of Shuozhou.

606
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Wei Zheng just arrived in the city of Shuozhou.

607
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,120
He met Li Jiancheng's former subordinate, Li Zhi'an.

608
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
And Li Yuanji's subordinate, Li Si Xing.

609
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
He was arrested and imprisoned.

610
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
He released the two of them on the spot.

611
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
The two of them ran away without a trace.

612
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
They were so bold.

613
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Please call them back.

614
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
And punish them severely.

615
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Duke.

616
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Your Highness.

617
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
How can I remember that you sent him to do this task?

618
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,120
I think he needs to settle down in Hebei.

619
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
He didn't ask him to set out on the road to set out.

620
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
And he can still lead the troops.

621
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
It doesn't matter.

622
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Your Highness.

623
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Mr. Wei's action reminds me of someone.

624
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
And a man who is as dangerous as a horse.

625
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Your Highness, please tell me.

626
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,120
The man who is the flag bearer of the State of Zhan, Feng Xuan.

627
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Yes.

628
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Feng Xuan who is the flag bearer of the State of Feng.

629
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
He is indeed an ordinary man.

630
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Feng Xuan burned the flag on his own.

631
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
And the man who released Wei Xianma

632
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
is a man who can fight on horseback.

633
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
I will give you the order.

634
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Six days ago, the East Palace and Prince Qi were attacked.

635
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Seven days ago, the people who were against Li Yuanji

636
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
were not allowed to tell each other.

637
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
They were to be punished.

638
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Your Highness, please think twice.

639
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
If even the news of the news was banned,

640
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,120
wouldn't the rest of the party be more fearless?

641
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Wei Zheng has tasted the sweet taste.

642
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Maybe even Wang Junkuo

643
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
would be pardoned.

644
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Look.

645
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Your Highness.

646
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I can't be so careless

647
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
and not concern about the state affairs.

648
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
I am a member of the State of the State.

649
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,120
How dare I not report to the State?

650
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Such a coward.

651
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
As for Wang Junkuo,

652
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,120
send a team of capable people to suppress him.

653
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
In case of suspicion,

654
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
don't say he was brought to justice.

655
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Just say he was ordered to enter the capital.

656
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I will do it now.

657
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Mr. Fang,

658
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,120
is there any news from Leyan?

659
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Do you think

660
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
God is punishing me?

661
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I have lost a Changge.

662
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Do you want me to lose Yan'er again?

663
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Your Highness,

664
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
don't be so careless.

665
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Princess Yongan and Princess Yongning

666
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
are blessed with the world.

667
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
They will come back safely.

668
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,120
I will send more people to find them.

669
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Your Highness.

670
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
You are quite clever.

671
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Hailang, look.

672
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
There is wine.

673
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
This roast chicken is very delicious.

674
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Smell it.

675
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Xiaoba.

676
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Uncle serves you wine.

677
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
The wine is very fragrant.

678
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Uncle Ma, drink.

679
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Drink.

680
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Drink.

681
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
One more.

682
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
One more.

683
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Drink.

684
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Drink.

685
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Drink.

686
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Leyan.

687
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
You want to run away?

688
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
If they find out,

689
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
I will kill you.

690
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I finally got them locked up.

691
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
If I don't run away, I won't have a chance.

692
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Maybe tomorrow,

693
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
they will sell me to Caisheng Zhege.

694
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
If you don't want to,

695
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
don't worry. I won't take you.

696
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
But...

697
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
I will go with you.

698
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I will go with you.

699
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
I will go with you.

700
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
I will go with you.

701
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
This is a good sister.

702
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Be careful.

703
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Susu.

704
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
They locked the door.

705
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
How can we get out?

706
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Come.

707
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Leyan, look.

708
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
There is a hole over there.

709
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
It's too high.

710
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
We can't climb up.

711
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
It's okay, Susu.

712
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
We have two people.

713
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Me?

714
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Yes.

715
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Leyan, I will take the lead.

716
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
You take me out first.

717
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Then I will come to save you.

718
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Okay?

719
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Leyan, don't be noisy.

720
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Ma Zi is still sleeping outside.

721
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Stay here for a while.

722
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
I will come back to save you.

723
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
But you...

724
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Susu.

725
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Friends?

726
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,600
They lost the

727
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,120
cousin who got yourself strict.

728
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Come, let's go.

729
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,120
The two of them are out and about in Shuozhou every day.

730
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,520
They don't have any special records.

731
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,920
They also bought a lot of food for the beggars in the temple.

732
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,120
They said it was a command from the Governor Gongsun.

733
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,320
There's nothing suspicious about it.

734
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,520
The people are very grateful to the Governor.

735
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Enough. Don't follow them.

736
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,320
You're exposed.

737
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Leave.

738
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,520
You don't have to follow them anymore.

739
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,120
I'll leave.

740
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,920
I'll leave.

741
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,720
I'll leave.

742
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,520
I'll leave.

743
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,120
You don't have to follow them anymore.

744
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Yes.

745
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,720
Okay.

746
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,720
Mr. Qin.

747
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,920
You two are back.

748
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,320
Are you used to staying in Shuozhou?

749
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
We're used to it.

750
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,920
We went around the city today.

751
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,720
There's good food and fun in the city.

752
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
That's good.

753
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,120
I have a message from the capital.

754
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,720
I want to report to the Governor.

755
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
I don't want to be a burden.

756
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,520
If you need anything, just call me.

757
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,720
Thank you for your help.

758
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,920
Is it a message from Chang'an?

759
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,520
It should be.

760
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
Then we...

761
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,120
Go back to your room.

762
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,920
Go back to your room.

763
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
leye, Lv Ruer.

764
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,320
Mengyao!

765
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Come up here.

766
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:49,180
So

767
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm afraid something is worse

768
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,220
to happen.

769
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,140
AAD is pregnancy,

770
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,820
but Tongduohhu is the guardian,

771
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,440
Cheng ZhUN went through the order of Liunity,

772
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,120
and they were selbsterd carrots and jams.

773
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:11,820
Yan Ri...

774
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,500
Has been mÃ³nchur around Tang's army,

775
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,980
which must mean

776
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,520
that he is a good wolf.

777
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,100
Hurry.

778
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,640
With your kung fu skills,

779
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
you are not ordinary at all.

780
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,600
Se rhythms can hide themselves.

781
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,980
Steward Jin is also from the best Academy.

782
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
He sent you here.

783
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,520
You are wrong,

784
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,520
he is only the servant.

785
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,660
But if I don't investigate,

786
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
You're not from Longxi, are you?

787
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
I've been living outside for a long time.

788
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
I'm very familiar with Longxi's accent.

789
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Although you're deliberately imitating,

790
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
you still have a difference.

791
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
What is your identity?

792
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,720
I deliberately told you

793
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
that you would follow me if I had news from the capital.

794
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,720
The spy in the north,

795
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
the spy in the south,

796
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
the spy in the north,

797
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
the spy in the south,

798
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
the spy in the south,

799
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
is the spy in the south,

800
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
the spy in the south,

801
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
or the spy in the south?

802
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
You're from Chang'an.

803
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Are you here to take back the military power of the governor?

804
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,720
The court has always been worried that the governor would use his own army.

805
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
But you should understand

806
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
that Shuozhou can survive until now

807
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
and not be held responsible by Chang'an.

808
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
You can go to Shuozhou and have a look.

809
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
What is the life of the people?

810
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,720
What is the life of the people in the north?

811
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
It's a place of debate.

812
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,720
It's not easy for such a people to have such a style.

813
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
You're thinking too much.

814
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I'm not a court official.

815
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
I just want to find a place to stay.

816
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
I pretend to be from Longxi

817
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
and just want to borrow the idea of ââa home.

818
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Please take it.

819
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
I'm sorry.

820
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm not interested in your past.

821
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
I don't care what your intention is.

822
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
You don't know your family.

823
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I don't know you.

824
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
You're a smart person.

825
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
You should know it well.

826
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
I'm sorry.

827
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
I'm sorry.

828
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
I'm sorry.

829
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I'm sorry.

830
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
I'm sorry.

831
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I'm sorry.

832
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
I'm sorry.

833
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I'm sorry.

834
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm sorry.

835
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
I'm sorry.

836
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
I'm sorry.

837
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I'm sorry.

838
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm sorry.

839
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
I'm sorry.

840
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Please.

841
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Shoot.

842
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
They found Susu ran away.

843
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Don't be afraid.

844
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
You're better than her.

845
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
You won't be like her.

846
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
I'm here to see you today

847
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
because I have something to discuss with you.

848
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Just tell me.

849
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
I've been thinking these days.

850
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
If you don't mind,

851
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
can you stay in my house

852
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
and be my assistant?

853
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Your brother, Dou,

854
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
can be your assistant.

855
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
What?

856
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Do you think you're being too talented?

857
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
No.

858
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Shisi.

859
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Thank you for your understanding.

860
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Okay.

861
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
This is my personal guard, Xu Feng.

862
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Guard Xu.

863
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Director Li.

864
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Okay.

865
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
The chief executive of the criminal police

866
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
asked me to meet him in his house.

867
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
I'll go now.

868
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
You're both talented.

869
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
Now it's time to hire someone.

870
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
You can't care too much.

871
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
But I still say

872
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
if you don't move the Gongsun family,

873
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
I won't move you.

874
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Mr. Qin, you misunderstood.

875
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,720
I'll do my best to serve you.

876
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Your Majesty.

877
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
I'm sorry.

878
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
I'm sorry.

879
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
I'm sorry.

880
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
I'm sorry.

881
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I'm sorry.

882
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
I'm sorry.

883
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm sorry.

884
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
I'm sorry.

885
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm sorry.

886
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I'm sorry.

887
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I'm sorry.

888
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm sorry.

889
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
I'm sorry.

890
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,720
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
I'm sorry.

892
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
I'm sorry.

893
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
I'm sorry.

894
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm sorry.

895
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
I'm sorry.

896
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
I'm sorry.

897
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
I'm sorry.

898
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
I'm sorry.

899
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
I'm sorry.

900
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
I'm sorry.

919
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
I'm sorry.

920
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
I'm sorry.

926
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I'm sorry.

928
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
I'm sorry.

929
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
I'm sorry.

930
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
I'm sorry.

931
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
I'm sorry.

932
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm sorry.

933
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
I'm sorry.

934
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
I'm sorry.

935
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
I'm sorry.

936
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,720
I'm sorry.

938
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,720
I'm sorry.

939
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
I'm sorry.

940
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm sorry.

941
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
I'm sorry.

942
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I'm sorry.

944
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
I'm sorry.

945
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
I'm sorry.

946
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
I'm sorry.

947
