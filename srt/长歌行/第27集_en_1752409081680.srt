1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The past is broken from the frost to the broken wings

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Still have to fly

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Follow the direction of light

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Forget you

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am a strong woman

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will sing for him

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the king of life and the king of delusion

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Xiaowu

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wait for me

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Xiaowu

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait for me

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't go

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xiaowu

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wait for me

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't go

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xiaowu

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Xiaowu

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Princess

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Princess

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I am sorry

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where is Xiaowu

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where is Xiaowu

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I have ordered people to bury Xiaowu

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't worry

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Xiaowu

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My brother had a dream

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I dreamed that Xiaowu was still alive

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I don't know why

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He kept running and running

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Just dare not come back to me

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You say

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Is Xiaowu blaming me?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If it wasn't for me

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He wouldn't have been hurt

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He wouldn't have been sick

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He could have lived

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He could have lived

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I promised him

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I would give him a whole car of rice

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I would take him back to Chang'an

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Take him to see the four seasons

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The flowers are bright and the mountains are clear

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Nothing is useful

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Princess

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He went with Xia'er

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He didn't blame you

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You don't have to worry

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Tomorrow

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will go to see him

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to accompany him for the last time

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Princess

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are not afraid of me?

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All the way

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm not afraid of death

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why should I be afraid of you?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I used to be afraid of things

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now I remember

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's such a tragedy

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Princess, people have their own world

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This amulet takes me to find you

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now I have no one to return to

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now I have no one to return to

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I hope he can keep the princess safe

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why is this with you?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's a long story

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I found it in Hongyi Palace

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe it's the will of God

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If God really connects me

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Please bless the world

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The world is peaceful

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It will be

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
God will be kind

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If it's God's will

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll leave it to you

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I hope he can play the last role

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't be too sad

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Take care of yourself

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have ordered the most familiar maid to come and take care of you

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She will be here soon

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll be waiting for you

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
To be honest

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a good opportunity for you to come here

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Listen

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Liuyun Temple is a place of good fortune

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a good place to control everything

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a good place to take care of people

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Did you not listen to the guard?

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This girl is so rude

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Greetings, Master Sun

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Master has been talking about you every day

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Finally, he brought you here

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Go tell Master that Master Sun is here

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Say it inside

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This lady is

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She was picked up

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
She's in a bad mood

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She's angry

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Lady, please

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you feeling better?

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm fine

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Come, eat something

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Eat something

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Eat slowly

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is where Liuyun Temple saved refugees

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
These refugees are very poor

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Our Liuyun Temple saved refugees in time

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Our Liuyun Temple saved refugees in time

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Our Liuyun Temple saved refugees in time

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Three courtyards

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is the pharmacy

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Opposite is Master Sun's clinic

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Connected to the clinic in front

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is the residence of the temple owner

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's go to the backyard

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's go to the backyard

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is our backyard

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The backyard is quiet

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are many rooms

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can choose the room you want to live

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you feel bored

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can come to me and A'Bi

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Play together

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Lady, what are you looking at?

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What is this place?

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is where the temple owner usually rest

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We call it the temple room

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Look

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is our room

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is our room

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is our room

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is our room

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is our room

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is our room

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is our room

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,640
Let me live here then.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
I just wanted to say thank you.

144
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,700
If I'm not mistaken,

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,360
I was just some bit afraid yesterday.

146
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,780
I looked around for a moment.

147
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,120
Even when I thought about putting the Immortal on top of him,

148
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,460
I suddenly felt I loved him more.

149
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,420
Why was it already a nightmare for me to一個 restless man like you?

150
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,700
Lord Arrow!

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,840
A dead person can't be revived.

153
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,680
Your Highness, please don't be sad.

154
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,880
Actually,

155
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,960
you don't have to blame yourself too much.

156
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,640
It's just that the child's life is not good.

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,120
She has been taking care of you on the way.

158
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,640
It's a good thing.

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,080
If you really don't want to go,

160
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,840
when we come back to Chang'an,

161
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,440
let's give her a reward.

162
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,960
I don't care about that.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,760
Besides,

164
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
people are gone.

165
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
What's the use of these?

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,560
I hope that one day,

167
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,920
the people will stop suffering from war

168
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,640
and stop living in cold and barren lands.

169
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,160
Everyone will have a job.

170
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
Everyone will have a place to live.

171
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,480
Everyone will be able to live a life

172
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
without being lost.

173
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,400
This is probably a peaceful life.

174
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,720
It will be.

175
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
It will definitely be.

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,040
Wu,

177
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,840
I'll eat this bowl of rice for you.

178
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,840
There's so much rice.

179
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,840
You won't starve again.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,720
Mr. Wu died in Chang'an last summer.

181
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,640
There're thousands of dead by year.

182
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
You won't be able to eat anymore.

183
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,640
How can you do this?

184
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,160
What I want to say

185
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
is not to displays showing my cruelty.

186
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,440
Mr. Wu and I

187
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,920
don't have different interests.

188
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,320
It's my nuovo sedation.

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
I am sorry for my sister.

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I will never forget you

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I will never forget you

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I will never forget you

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I will never forget you

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I will never forget you

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I will never forget you

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I will never forget you

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I will never forget you

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I will never forget you

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I will never forget you

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I will never forget you

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I will never forget you

202
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I will never forget you

203
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I will never forget you

204
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Xun pact

205
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
I remember how she behaved

206
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,900
She didn't seem to be so kind

207
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
while lecturing him

208
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I thought they couldn't understand

209
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,660
that

210
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,060
Xia several times

211
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,240
But her dad

212
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
was really strict

213
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
and gave her time

214
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
and love

215
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Xia was effortless

216
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
What happened?

217
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
I'm glad to see you back.

218
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,360
You should go and rest.

219
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
I can do it.

220
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Well...

221
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I can do it.

222
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
All right.

223
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,760
If you need anything,

224
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,240
just call me.

225
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,280
Class Hero

226
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,080
The princess is amiing the court tonight.

227
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,640
Keep an eye on 구 commando Overseas Office.

228
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,520
Yes, Sir.

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:32,520
Radio

230
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
The audio-realityIf you want to meet him tonight, true it!

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,360
I dare not to stop you from sending His Majesty's edict.

232
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Please accept my order.

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

234
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,200
In addition, please tell His Majesty

235
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,560
that Princess Yongan has been looking for her in Luoyang.

236
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,400
She is safe and sound.

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,080
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

238
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes.

239
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,440
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

240
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
I forgot that...

241
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,120
I'll send someone to guard you tomorrow

242
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,200
to protect you.

243
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,240
I just...

244
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,600
I'll come again tomorrow.

245
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,280
Wait.

246
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,080
You came so late.

247
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,720
Something important must have happened.

248
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,560
Yes.

249
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
I just received a letter from His Majesty.

250
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Please have a look.

251
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,200
The Crown Prince has left Chang'an

252
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,480
and is waiting for His Majesty to see Han Qing

253
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
to show his gratitude.

254
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,600
It's almost time

255
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,000
to count the days.

256
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,560
Thank you for sending a letter to me.

257
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
I'll read it later.

258
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,400
In that case,

259
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,000
I won't rush to go back to the palace.

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The Crown Prince is young and is very playful.

261
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,360
I'd better keep an eye on him.

262
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
There will be a place for me to help him.

263
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,000
But...

264
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
It's settled.

265
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,480
Please stay with me for a few more days in Luoyang.

266
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,240
Your Highness,

267
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,880
you've really changed a lot.

268
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
After what happened,

269
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,440
I'm still blessed.

270
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,520
I have both good and bad.

271
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,480
I finally understand

272
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
what Father said.

273
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,720
How can we show our gratitude to the people?

274
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,880
As Father's daughter,

275
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,040
how can I not grow up quickly?

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,720
You must have suffered a lot on this journey.

277
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
I've met many difficulties.

278
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
But I've also met many people

279
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,840
who need to be grateful.

280
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,160
The hardships will pass.

281
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,960
But

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,880
gratitude

283
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
will always be remembered.

284
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,400
I used to look at people

285
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,240
and often look at their appearance.

286
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,480
Now I know

287
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,520
that people need to be honest.

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,040
Some people

289
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,040
look at words with a cruel heart.

290
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
Some people

291
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,800
look at cold

292
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,000
and kind hearts.

293
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,720
Just like you, Mr. Hao.

294
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,760
Li Wanqing

295
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,120
Why can't I continue it?

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,040
Your path is different.

297
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,440
You'll never learn it.

298
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Just give it up.

299
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,120
abolish?

300
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,720
What's wrong with that?

301
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
You think why I want to defend Shuozhou?

302
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,320
War or surrender

303
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
are just means.

304
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,320
People's health and not being attacked

305
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,920
are the most important.

306
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,520
These are the principles

307
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,720
I firmly hold in my heart.

308
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
What is my sword?

309
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,520
Mr. Qin.

310
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,320
Yuanniang fell asleep?

311
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,320
Yes.

312
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,920
Good.

313
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
Luo Shiba said he would communicate with us.

314
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,120
But we sent the letter initiatively.

315
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
He didn't even reply.

316
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,720
He suddenly said he wanted to meet

317
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
and brought a friend.

318
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,920
A friend?

319
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes.

320
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,520
He said he wanted to meet with me.

321
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,920
He said he wanted to meet with me.

322
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
A friend?

323
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,320
Bring a friend?

324
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,720
We have no progress.

325
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,720
Maybe the friend he brought

326
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,520
can bring news to you.

327
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,320
Luo Shiba, you finally came.

328
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,520
Your friend is...

329
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,720
Luo Shiba.

330
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
The friend you want to bring is him?

331
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,720
Brothers.

332
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,120
Kill Ashile Sun for me.

333
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
Revenge for yourself.

334
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Wait.

335
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,120
I have no qualms about Gongsun Heng.

336
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
Now Changge's whereabouts are unknown.

337
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,720
I entered the hall this time

338
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
just to find him.

339
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
You find him?

340
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
You took him to the grassland

341
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,520
to make him face such a thing?

342
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,520
Luo Shiba,

343
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,040
don't you know what kind of person

344
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,920
Ashile is?

345
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
You brought such a person to the hall?

346
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,320
I just want to find him.

347
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
Even if you don't help me,

348
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
I will find a way.

349
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,920
You...

350
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,920
Ashile Sun,

351
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,520
let me ask you.

352
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,920
The notice submitted by the Command of Li State

353
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
is yours?

354
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Yes, it's mine.

355
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,120
This is the best way to protect the Command of Li State.

356
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,720
Then why are you looking for him everywhere?

357
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,000
I have no purpose.

358
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,320
It's just because

359
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,640
he is my friend.

360
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,320
Friend?

361
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,480
Commandant Li is your friend?

362
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,880
Senior Qin, are you confused?

363
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,320
You believe he is your friend?

364
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,280
You should know how the people in the city scolded Commandant Li.

365
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,560
I know.

366
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,600
It's because of the notice from Ashile Tribe

367
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,040
that the people's anger was calmed down.

368
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,480
And Ashile Sun, the Eagle Division,

369
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,160
is a master.

370
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,640
That day, Commandant Li was shot by him.

371
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
But he didn't die.

372
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,200
I felt strange at that time.

373
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,760
Now I understand.

374
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,080
You are old friends.

375
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,000
That's why you are always thinking for Commandant Li.

376
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,040
What about the grudge between the governor and Madam?

377
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,400
The battle was fierce.

378
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
The blood was flowing.

379
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
The people suffered.

380
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,440
Ashile Sun

381
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,200
could agree to the governor's request.

382
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,560
He allowed the people in the city to be spared from the torture.

383
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,640
He is already a kind man.

384
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
Xu Feng, don't be so impulsive.

385
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Now our goal

386
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,200
is to find the young master.

387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,560
He has a special identity.

388
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,720
He can only be secretly guarded.

389
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,120
One more person means one more power.

390
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,880
Xu Feng, get ready.

391
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,080
Let's go to the city together.

392
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,680
Please.

393
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,120
Thank you.

394
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,520
You are welcome.

395
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,920
Please.

396
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,720
Where is the Ming Mansion in Luoyang?

397
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,120
Why hasn't he come out yet?

398
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,120
He doesn't even care about me.

399
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,920
Master,

400
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,320
there are some people outside the gate.

401
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
We should surround the house.

402
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,120
The people can't come out.

403
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
The people outside can't get in.

404
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Change the path immediately.

405
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,320
Don't let them get in.

406
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
Yes.

407
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,120
Wait.

408
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,720
Your Highness.

409
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,120
Father asked me to go to Luoyang

410
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,920
just to check the suffering of the people.

411
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,320
I will go to show my gratitude to the people

412
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,920
and make decisions for the people.

413
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,120
Wei,

414
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
follow me to the government office.

415
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,920
I want the people of the Tang Dynasty to know

416
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,320
that their crown prince is the best in the world.

417
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,120
Your Highness.

418
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
Give us food.

419
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,920
Give us food.

420
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,720
Give us food.

421
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Come out.

422
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Give us food.

423
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,320
Come out.

424
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,120
Food.

425
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,320
We want food.

426
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
Come out.

427
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,920
Give us food.

428
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,320
Give us food.

429
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,120
Food.

430
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,720
Come out.

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,120
We want food.

432
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Everyone,

433
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,120
the crown prince is the best in the world.

434
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,520
Give us food.

435
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,720
Give us food.

436
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,520
Give us food.

437
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
Don't die.

438
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,120
The crown prince is here.

439
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,520
Give us food.

440
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,720
Crown prince.

441
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
You are really the crown prince.

442
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,120
Give us food.

443
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,920
Everyone, come here.

444
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,120
The crown prince is here.

445
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320
Everyone, come here.

446
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Crown prince.

447
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Your Highness.

448
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Come here.

449
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,920
Give us food.

450
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Wei, stop them.

451
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
Don't let them come here.

452
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,520
Back off.

453
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Don't hurt the people.

454
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
They are all people who can't protect the iron.

455
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,920
Give us food.

456
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Give us food.

457
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Give us food.

458
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,720
Give us food.

459
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,320
You.

460
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,120
You.

461
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,920
No.

462
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,720
Sister.

463
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,520
Sister.

464
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,120
Sister.

465
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,920
Sister.

466
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,720
Blood is flowing.

467
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,320
It's a big hit.

468
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
It's a big hit.

469
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,720
We retreat.

470
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
We can't let anything happen to the crown prince.

471
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,920
Retreat.

472
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,120
It's a big hit.

473
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
It's a big hit.

474
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,520
Hurry up.

475
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
It's a big hit.

476
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Hurry up.

477
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,320
It's a big hit.

478
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
It's a big hit.

479
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Hurry up.

480
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
What's going on outside?

481
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Your Highness.

482
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
The people are making trouble outside.

483
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,320
You don't have to worry.

484
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,720
Did my brother arrive today?

485
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,120
Li said it's urgent.

486
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,720
Open the door.

487
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,520
Your Highness.

488
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,120
It's noisy outside.

489
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,320
You'd better not go out.

490
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,720
I know the people outside.

491
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,520
They came from Yunzhou.

492
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm one of them.

493
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,520
They're not here.

494
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,320
They're just too hungry.

495
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,720
Besides,

496
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
my brother is coming soon.

497
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
As long as they know

498
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,520
His Majesty sent the crown prince here

499
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,120
to make them feel at ease.

500
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,320
But outside...

501
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,120
Besides,

502
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,920
you're here with me.

503
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,520
Your Highness.

504
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,120
Sir.

505
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,920
The crown prince is here.

506
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
He's outside the house.

507
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Open the door.

508
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
But...

509
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,720
If anything happens to the crown prince,

510
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,920
no one can take responsibility.

511
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,520
I'll protect the princess.

512
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Open the door.

513
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,120
Yes.

514
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
The crown prince is killed.

515
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,120
He's killed.

516
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,520
He's killed.

517
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,320
What should we do?

518
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,520
What should we do?

519
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,320
The crown prince left them.

520
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,920
We're starving in Luoyang.

521
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,320
No one cares about us.

522
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,120
No one cares about us.

523
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,920
Everyone,

524
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
calm down.

525
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,320
Listen to me.

526
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,920
The crown prince

527
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,520
won't leave you alone.

528
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Is it true?

529
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,720
Nonsense!

530
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,520
The crown prince

531
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,320
just left us alone!

532
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Yes!

533
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
He left us alone!

534
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,720
It's not true!

535
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,920
We're left alone!

536
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,120
He left us alone!

537
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,520
He left us alone!

538
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,920
We're left alone!

539
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,320
We're left alone!

540
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
We're left alone!

541
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,520
We're left alone!

542
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,920
We're left alone!

543
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,840
To my sisterflo sonVillage,

Yes.

561
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,920
Even the Crown Prince doesn't care about us.

562
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
What else can you do?

563
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,920
Right?

564
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes.

565
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,920
Everyone, Mr. Zhang.

566
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,320
I'm the Princess of Great Tang.

Please rest in peace.

Now we have to go through

573
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,280
the difficulties of Luoyang together.

574
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,160

Let's go.

577
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,000
Let's go.

578
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
Let's go.

579
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,040
Let's go.

580
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,160
I can't see.

581
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,880
What are you doing?

582
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,760
If the wound doesn't stop bleeding,

583
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
it will be broken.

584
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,680
Come on.

585
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,480
No need.

586
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,600
It's much better.

587
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,320
Don't push.

588
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,000
You pretended to be injured

589
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,160
and made the people tremble.

590
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,600
What's the point?

591
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,800
Say it.

592
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
What's the point?

593
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Very good.

594
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
You won't say it, will you?

595
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,760
Then you'll never say it.

596
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,880
Hao Du.

597
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,360
He's just too hungry.

598
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,920
He'll do this if he's scared.

599
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Don't hurt him.

600
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Did you see that?

601
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,240
Did you see that?

602
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,600
Her Highness can even

603
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,480
bear such a person.

604
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,400
How could she leave you alone?

605
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,840
Yeah.

606
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,920
She'll be with us.

607
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,720
Yeah.

608
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,440
That's great.

609
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
Yeah.

610
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,200
We're so worried.

611
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,440
Shuyu.

612
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
Liu Yan.

613
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's really you.

614
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,440
Great.

615
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
You're finally back.

616
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
I've been looking for you for a long time.

617
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
I've searched the whole of Beijing.

618
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,440
I'm afraid I can't find you.

619
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
I'm sorry.

621
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm sorry.

622
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
I'm sorry.

623
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm sorry.

624
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I'm sorry.

625
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
I'm sorry.

626
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I'm sorry.

627
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
I'm sorry.

628
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
I'm sorry.

629
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
I'm sorry.

630
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,960
It's all my fault.

631
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
I lost you.

632
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You suffered.

633
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Shuyu.

634
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
It's not your fault.

635
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,040
Who can predict

636
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,440
the future of Danxi Huofu?

637
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,240
Besides,

638
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm fine.

639
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
But you...

640
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
You've lost weight.

641
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
I can't find you.

642
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
I can't be proud of myself.

643
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,520
Liu Yan, tell me.

644
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
From Youzhou to Luoyang,

645
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,920
what have you been through?

646
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,520
I've been through a lot along the way.

647
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,720
If it weren't for this trip,

648
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,520
I wouldn't have known so many things in my life.

649
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,640
I would be just a

650
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
golden sparrow without seeing the wind and snow.

651
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Don't worry.

652
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
From now on,

653
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
I won't let you suffer again.

654
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
What's wrong?

655
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Your Highness,

656
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,080
go and see the Crown Prince.

657
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Your Highness,

658
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
His Highness asked me to tell you

659
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,880
that you were frightened

660
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,480
and suddenly got high fever.

661
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm afraid

662
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,080
you can't go to South Hill

663
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,480
to see the refugees.

664
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,880
The Crown Prince is ill?

665
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Yes.

666
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Your Highness.

667
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
His Highness said

668
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,480
he would give you the sickly gas.

669
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,880
Your Highness is visiting my brother.

670
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,080
How dare you disobey me?

671
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
If you delay the Crown Prince's illness,

672
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,880
you'll lose ten heads.

673
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
I'm afraid you'll lose your head.

674
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Your Highness,

675
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
you'll lose ten heads.

676
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Ouch.

677
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,480
Stop pretending.

678
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Sister.

679
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Father asked you to come to Luoyang

680
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,480
because of the great Han's people.

681
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,680
He asked you to convince everyone

682
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
to establish the image of the Crown Prince of Tang.

683
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,280
You're hiding here to pretend to be ill.

684
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,680
How can you say that?

685
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Sister.

686
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,280
You saw it.

687
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Those people are not refugees.

688
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,680
They are Han's bandits.

689
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Look at them.

690
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
They are covered with blood

691
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,280
and have no teeth.

692
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,480
I was so scared.

693
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,680
I thought

694
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,280
I would lose my head.

695
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,480
I won't go.

696
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Brother.

697
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,680
I know

698
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
you're still young.

699
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,880
You'll be scared

700
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,480
when you encounter these things.

701
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,680
But you have to understand

702
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,080
that one day,

703
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,680
you have to take the responsibility on your shoulders.

704
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,080
Especially you.

705
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,080
Sister.

706
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
I know.

707
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
I know everything.

708
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,680
But I just arrived in Luoyang.

709
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Can't you let me have a rest?

710
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,480
I understand

711
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,880
what you said.

712
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Don't worry.

713
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,880
I'll grow up to be

714
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,680
a man who can do everything.

715
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,480
After all,

716
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm father's blood.

717
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,280
Forget it.

718
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,680
You have to do it.

719
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,480
Sister has experienced

720
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,080
a lot on this journey.

721
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
And I understand a lot.

722
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,880
Since the people in the world are supporting us,

723
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,680
we should take on their life.

724
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,280
Brother.

725
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,080
Do you know the two words of Chu Jun?

726
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,680
Chu,

727
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,080
Zhi,

728
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,680
Yu Hou Zhi Yi.

729
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,080
Jun,

730
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,280
Zun Ye,

731
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
Tian Xia Zhi Shou.

732
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,280
You have to grow up quickly.

733
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,880
Like A Ye,

734
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,680
you have the trust of the people.

735
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,880
You can be the famous emperor.

736
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,880
Hao Du.

737
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,780
Jing,

738
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:13,080
are you

739
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,480
here?

740
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,880
That must be you.

741
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
You're venting your anger on Li Changge?

742
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,600
Protect the Crown Prince first.

743
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,160
Don't lose him again.

744
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,360
Hao Du.

745
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
If you didn't want to kill Li Changge,

746
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Yan'er wouldn't be fighting alone.

747
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,400
Are you pushing your responsibility now?

748
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm not afraid to take the responsibility.

749
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,600
I just want to tell you

750
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
that if a person is too stubborn,

751
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
he will lose his nature.

752
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,680
Xiao Bi.

753
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
Miss Ar night.

754
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,440
Xiao Bi night.

755
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,460
Miss Ar night.

756
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,360
This picture maybe...

757
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,520
I have to model on MG.

758
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
This picture maybe...

759
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,880
I have to model on MG.

760
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,400
A-A-G...

761
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,700
nacho...

762
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,240
Frost...

763
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,300
nothing?

764
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,600
There's an older named Someone少女

765
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
With a strange name,

766
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,320
is born as someone very good

767
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,420
and 타 할過的人

768
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
he kept staring at the painting on the wall.

769
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,140
He didn't even change his posture.

770
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,020
Do you think he was stimulated by something?

771
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,700
This man is really like a donkey.

772
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,020
I told him I couldn't do it.

773
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,260
He insisted.

774
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,460
I'll go and have a look.

775
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,140
Situ, please stay.

776
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,740
Master.

777
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,100
Can I talk to this little friend?

778
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,500
You know.

779
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,860
It'sapa.

780
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,180
His Majesty is not here.

781
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,620
It will be too dangerous.

782
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,780
Your Highness.

783
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Gu Ruosure has arrived.

784
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,220
Yuwen competitions are about to missile round of 0 missed.

785
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,860
You've always been in this quiet room.

786
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
Do you have any misunderstanding?

787
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,980
I failed to follow your instructions.

788
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,980
I've been in the middle of everything.

789
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,540
But I hate the nobility of Dao.

790
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,180
Only when I'm with the right people can I be at ease.

791
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,660
Only when I'm with the right people can I be at peace.

792
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,660
All these years,

793
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,140
I've been so careful.

794
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,620
But only recently,

795
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,900
I realized

796
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,900
that I was wrong.

797
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,260
If I don't fight,

798
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,100
I won't let someone like my brother

799
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,260
die for me.

800
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
If I don't fight,

801
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,780
I won't let someone like my father

802
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,500
die for me.

803
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
If I don't fight,

804
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,660
I won't let my friends

805
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,540
who entrusted me with the whole family

806
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,620
die for me.

807
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,340
The day he died,

808
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,180
because of me,

809
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,660
an elder

810
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,860
took me out of the old age

811
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,100
and taught me how to find my own Dao.

812
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,460
Dao is fearless.

813
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,700
That's why.

814
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,780
The mercy of the Dao.

815
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,100
If you really understand this,

816
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,940
I've done

817
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,020
a good deed in the world.

818
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,980
So what if you're dead?

819
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,540
A dead person won't come back to life.

820
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,460
I just hate that I didn't understand earlier.

821
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,660
Your grave is already precious to the Mi clan.

822
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,020
There are many refugees in Luoyang recently.

823
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,820
Liuyun Temple is busy with the old medicine.

824
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,260
If you have the time,

825
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,420
you can help me and Sun Zhenren.

826
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,700
The Dao

827
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,380
belongs to the people.

828
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,140
It depends on the world.

829
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,220
It's limited to the past.

830
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,060
It can only increase your troubles.

831
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,180
Master, from his speech,

832
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,980
you can guess his background.

833
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,780
It's not simple.

834
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,540
You don't want to

835
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,660
ask his background?

836
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,420
You know it well.

837
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,620
Liuyun Temple has been around for a hundred years.

838
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,740
I've never asked him.

839
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,940
It's really nostalgic.

840
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,540
When I was his age,

841
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,860
I thought I was the smartest person

842
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,580
in the world.

843
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,500
It seems that

844
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,140
he and Master

845
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,180
are fated to be together.

846
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,180
Sun Zhenren is also fated to be together.

847
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,580
The world is in chaos.

848
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,820
People are all like him.

849
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,780
Sun Zhenren,

850
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,740
can you go to the South Hill Temple with me tomorrow?

851
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,300
I heard that there are more refugees

852
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,340
than the people in the temple.

853
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,740
Sure.

854
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,940
If I can meet some rare diseases,

855
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,020
it will be very interesting.

856
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,020
It's a wonderful thing.

857
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,140
Have some tea.

858
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,140
Great.

859
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,460
You finally have dinner.

860
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,020
I was worried sick.

861
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,740
I heard that Sun Zhenren

862
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,980
spent a lot of effort to save you.

863
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,700
He said you almost died.

864
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,180
Change your clothes.

865
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,140
Is it beautiful?

866
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,180
Liuyun Temple is the most beautiful place in Luoyang.

867
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,580
The one you just saw

868
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,820
is our temple owner,

869
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,060
Master Jingdan.

870
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,980
He took in many refugees

871
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,740
who were suffering from drought and loss of their lives.

872
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
He's a good man.

873
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,300
He also asked me to ask about your next arrangement.

874
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,660
I'm afraid that Master Sun

875
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,580
will stay in Luoyang for a while.

876
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,300
I'm afraid that he will be too tired.

877
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,980
I'm afraid that he will be too tired.

878
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,660
I'm afraid that he will be too tired.

879
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,220
I'm afraid that he will be too tired.

880
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,780
I'm afraid that he will be too tired.

881
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
Master Jingdan,

882
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,220
I'm afraid that you will stay in Luoyang for a while.

883
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,220
Are you going back to your hometown

884
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,580
or staying here?

885
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,860
My hometown

886
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,300
is a place I can't go back to.

887
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,580
I'll stay here.

888
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,860
That's great.

889
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,380
I finally have a partner.

890
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,780
We are almost the same age

891
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,460
except for you, me, Tian Jing and Liu'er.

892
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,660
It's so lively here.

893
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,460
I'm the king's maid, Bi.

894
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
What's your name?

895
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,740
There are no long songs in Tang.

896
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,340
I'd better avoid some trouble.

897
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
Wu Xing.

898
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,340
My name is A'Li.

899
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,020
I'm gradually waking up

900
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,260
and swimming towards you.

901
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,860
Before saying goodbye,

902
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,180
I'm looking forward to it.

903
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,180
I'll remember your figure

904
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,020
and lock it into my tender dream.

905
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,180
Before dawn,

906
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,660
through the years,

907
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,300
my longing flows.

908
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,780
There's always a moment

909
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,380
that burns down the lies in my heart.

910
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,060
There's always a moment

911
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:57,660
that we meet each other.

912
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,860
In different worlds,

913
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,260
in different worlds,

914
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,940
we are like a cocoon.

915
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,620
Like the leaves

916
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:17,860
that have fallen into the eternal night sky.

917
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,900
There's always a moment

918
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:31,620
that burns down the lies in my heart.

919
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,260
There's always a moment

920
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:41,820
that we meet each other.

921
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,860
In different worlds,

922
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,220
in different worlds,

923
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,100
my longing grows.

924
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,860
Like the leaves

925
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:01,580
that have fallen into the eternal night sky.

926
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,620
There's always a moment

927
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:11,580
that burns down the lies in my heart.
