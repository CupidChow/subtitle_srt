1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
To the distance

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
The past is bitter

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,960
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,920
I will forget you

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,300
I will give this old

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,300
The look of my stubbornness

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,300
I want to use the light in the dark night

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
To return to the long yearning in the rain

12
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Climbing the river of life and the crazy of the king

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,960
The Legend of Chusen

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Episode 16

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Your highness, all these are my fault.

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,960
I lost my power and led the people of the east to the west.

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I hope you can forgive me. Please send me to the east.

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Okay, the two armies are competing against each other.

19
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Competing is fighting. This can't be completely your fault.

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I just didn't expect that Ashile's elite army would be so cunning.

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Xifeng, gather everyone.

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Come with me and the commandant Li to the east gate to fight the enemy.

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Yes.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,960
But your highness, they are in a hurry to attack the grain warehouse.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
The grain warehouse is far away from the east gate.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
How did they do it so fast?

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Shi Silang, you need to know that

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,960
From now on, you will face the most accurate and fierce cavalry of Ashile's.

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Fire!

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Fire!

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Fire!

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Fire!

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Fire!

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Listen to my command.

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Shoot!

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Fire!

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Stop!

38
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Stop!

39
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Stop!

40
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Master!

41
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Master!

42
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
It's okay. Just a little more.

43
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Master!

44
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
You go back first. I'm still here.

45
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Take everyone to the east gate.

46
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Yes.

47
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Take the commander back.

48
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Yes.

49
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Hurry.

50
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Oh no, they have reinforcements.

51
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Yaro has followed your plan and brought the grain back.

52
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Gong Siheng will find out soon.

53
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Take them.

54
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Why do I have to wear a mask?

55
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Fine. I would have looked good if I knew it.

56
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
How is it? Is it good?

57
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Isn't this Shi Silang?

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
So you are afraid that he will recognize us.

59
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
You hid your true identity before.

60
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Shut up.

61
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Since we are not true friends, it's easy.

62
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Kill him. The Qin thief will be the new king.

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I told you to shut up.

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Pass the order.

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Do your best.

66
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Listen to my command.

67
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Kill them.

68
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Kill them.

69
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Master, the east gate defense is weak.

70
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I have sent people to get the net and the stealer from other places.

71
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
But there is still a horse-horseshoe.

72
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Even the iron energy is not enough.

73
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Use the current iron energy to shoot one line of defense.

74
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Ying Shi Ji may avoid it.

75
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Let all iron energy play the greatest role.

76
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Yes.

77
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Kill them.

78
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
They or the people,

79
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
they are all full of energy.

80
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
They have enough water for the horses.

81
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Kill them.

82
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Father, don't eat.

83
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Don't eat.

84
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Don't eat.

85
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Don't eat.

86
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Run.

87
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Good.

88
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
It's the fourth prince again.

89
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Sun, we must kill him.

90
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
If we fail,

91
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
it's not good for Da Ke Han.

92
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Sun, what are you waiting for?

93
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Sun Tegin.

94
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Sun Tegin.

95
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Fire.

96
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Zhu introduced us to you.

97
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Shifang.

98
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Shifang.

99
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Shifang.

100
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Soldiers.

101
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,600
code

102
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
head down

103
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,820
Come home and stop

104
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:55,100
kill

105
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,720
Master retirement okay

106
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
Master retirement okay

107
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Master retirement okay

108
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
Master retirement okay

109
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Master retirement okay

110
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
Master fingerprint okay

111
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,920
Lei attorney

112
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,540
?!

113
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,280
D 예쁠a have to stand up

114
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,760
,​

115
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,040
​​​ news has arrived

116
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
How could this be?

117
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,360
Sun, you are a warrior of the first rank of the grasslands.

118
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,040
You are a hundred times better than them.

119
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,960
Great!

120
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Great!

121
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Great!

122
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Great!

123
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
No, Sun.

124
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Master Shuozhu is about to die.

125
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
The Tang army is in a big battle.

126
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
It's not a good chance to attack the city.

127
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Great!

128
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Great!

129
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Great!

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Great!

131
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Great!

132
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Great!

133
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Great!

134
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Great!

135
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Retreat.

136
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Go blind.

137
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Retreat.

138
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Now!

139
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
We won!

140
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
We won!

141
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Great!

142
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Great!

143
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Great!

144
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Great!

145
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Master!

146
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,880
Wait for me

147
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,680
Master

148
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
Why are you up

149
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,240
But now,

150
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,560
the war with Ashile Tribe is more important.

151
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,920
The crown prince is injured.

152
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,720
How can I rest well?

153
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,920
The crown prince's heart injury caused an old disease.

154
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,360
He's in the bedroom now.

155
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,440
A'Dou,

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,040
go to bed early.

157
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
I'll discuss with the crown prince about the treatment of...

158
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,680
Master,

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,800
don't forget.

160
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,920
Your purpose is not in Shuozhou,

161
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,000
but in Chang'an.

162
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,880
Your health is the most important.

163
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,080
A'Dou,

164
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,320
compared to the current situation in Shuozhou,

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,920
Li Shimin and I

166
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,160
are just the four of us.

167
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,920
But now,

168
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
the situation in Shuozhou is serious.

169
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,720
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

170
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,600
Moreover,

171
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,600
you'll change the medicine for me in time, right?

172
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm just worried about Master's health.

173
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,440
Look.

174
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm fine.

175
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,960
Master Lang is attacking Yun Dai.

176
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,280
Great Khan ordered you to capture Shuozhou in ten days.

177
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,840
Otherwise, you'll lead the troops to fight with him.

178
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,360
If we just fight with each other,

179
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
can we capture Shuozhou in ten days?

180
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,120
If Great Khan wants to do it himself,

181
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,120
our Eagle Division will be a joke.

182
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
We'll be trapped in the battle.

183
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
How long can we do it?

184
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,280
Right.

185
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
The granary is burnt.

186
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,840
The field is destroyed.

187
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,280
We'll starve to death.

188
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Mu Jin,

189
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,520
what do you think of my swordplay?

190
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,160
It's perfect.

191
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,320
Sun,

192
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
are you going to

193
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
fight with Shuozhou in this situation?

194
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,680
No.

195
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,600
Absolutely not.

196
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,000
I was wrong just now.

197
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,200
Your swordplay is excellent.

198
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,880
That Shi Si Lang will be fine.

199
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,160
Really?

200
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,360
Bring the military report.

201
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
We'll go to find Tu Kashe.

202
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
I want to solve his hidden problem.

203
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,120
Shuozhou

204
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
must be taken by Eagle Division.

205
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,800
You don't have to be angry, Tegin.

206
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
If you want to defeat Eagle Division,

207
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,400
I have another way.

208
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,040
You...

209
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
What are you doing here?

210
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,040
The Bear Division is badly injured.

211
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,960
What are you going to do?

212
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,600
Tegin.

213
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,240
Please spare my life.

214
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,120
I promise,

215
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,080
I promise

216
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,520
I'll kill Li Zhu Bu.

217
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,800
Please give me another chance.

218
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,280
If you miss the chance,

219
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
you won't have it again.

220
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,000
Your last move

221
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,520
will make the Bear Division and half of the brothers

222
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,400
unable to return to the grasslands.

223
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
If I give you another chance,

224
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm afraid I can't save you even if I have to.

225
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,240
Tegin.

226
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,560
I'm loyal to the Bear Division.

227
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,840
I can see it.

228
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,320
Come.

229
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,440
You plan to use this man's life

230
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,560
to collude with Great Khan?

231
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,600
Bear Division was misled by traitors.

232
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
I'll explain it

233
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,920
in person to Great Khan.

234
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,080
Why?!

235
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:23,100
Just

236
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,760
HEY DOG

237
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Then we can only tell the truth to Great Khan.

238
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,480
Tu Kashe openly disobeyed his order.

239
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Sun Deqian.

240
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,640
The murderer has received your order.

241
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,040
Please.

242
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,800
Please.

243
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,480
Yi Bukhan.

244
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,760
Yi Bukhan.

245
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,680
Yi Bukhan.

246
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,320
Is there anyone who can open the door for me?

247
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I'll send you everything

248
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,320
when I repair the camp.

249
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,680
The Eagle Division will change the camp.

250
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,320
There must be something.

251
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,920
You have to watch him.

252
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,840
Watch him.

253
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,560
Report.

254
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,160
Report.

255
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,840
Yes.

256
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
Watch the door.

257
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,000
Just say it.

258
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,560
You can buy the military counselor

259
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
for us.

260
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
Why did Ji Tu Kashe kill him?

261
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,200
I don't like traitors.

262
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,560
But he's right.

263
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
Gongsun Heng is a man of his word.

264
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,960
It's much easier to kill the Fourteenth Wolf first.

265
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
You know better than anyone

266
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,520
the consequences of Great Khan's fight.

267
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,440
Why are we just delaying it?

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,880
The Wolf Division of the Fourteenth is about to conquer Daizhou.

269
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
Great Khan ordered us to go to pick him up.

270
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,680
I think you should go there.

271
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,960
Me?

272
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,880
Ashile Sun.

273
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,360
I'm just a little talkative.

274
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
You're pushing me into the fire pit.

275
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,080
You'll set off after this battle.

276
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,440
Remember.

277
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,760
After we arrive at Daizhou,

278
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
leave some military clothes.

279
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,240
Don't make it difficult for the people.

280
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,160
You don't have to tell Great Khan about this.

281
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,160
That's all?

282
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,160
You'd better make it clear before you leave.

283
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,360
Run!

284
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Run!

285
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Run!

286
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Run!

287
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Run!

288
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Run!

289
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Run!

290
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Run!

291
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Run!

292
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Run!

293
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Run!

294
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Help!

295
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
Help!

296
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
What's going on?

297
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Help!

298
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Help!

299
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Open the door!

300
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Open the door!

301
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
What's going on?

302
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
They're coming in.

303
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,280
Close the door!

304
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm begging you.

305
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Why are you standing there?

306
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Come help!

307
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Please!

308
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,880
I'm begging you!

309
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Please!

310
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Run!

311
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,840
Open the door!

312
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,280
Please!

313
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Let him hide!

314
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,680
I'm begging you!

315
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Open the door!

316
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Open the door!

317
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Open the door!

318
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm begging you!

319
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
You!

320
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
This is the real me!

321
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
What are you doing?

322
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Let them in!

323
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
You're fat!

324
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
What do you think you are?

325
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
You dare to point a knife at me?

326
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
You're going to die!

327
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Help!

328
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Help me!

329
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Where is she?

330
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Help!

331
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
What are you doing?

332
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Great Khan sent us to chase the Dazhou's guards outside the city!

333
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Hurry up!

334
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Hurry!

335
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Master, where are we going?

336
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
We're going to check the city's east.

337
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
The city's east has been surrounded by the Eagle Division.

338
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
But the mountain forest outside the city's east is in shambles.

339
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
We didn't take any precautions.

340
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
The Eagle Division might be able to relax.

341
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Even if they're strict,

342
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
there are so many mountains that we can't avoid them.

343
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
A'Dou,

344
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
you've really grown up.

345
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
Who?

346
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Who is it?

347
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
It's me.

348
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
I'm the leader of the Eagle Division.

349
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm the leader of the Eagle Division.

350
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
I'm the leader of the Eagle Division.

351
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Shui Ling.

352
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Hurry up!

353
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Master, come with me!

354
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Go and call for help!

355
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
You've been following me all the way here.

356
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
It seems that you're not only after the Crown Prince's life,

357
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
but also after my life.

358
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
So what?

359
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Now that Gongsun is seriously injured,

360
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
and Shuozhou City is in a state of emergency,

361
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
do you have to kill me at this time?

362
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
Stop talking nonsense with me.

363
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
My duty is to help you to save the Emperor.

364
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm not going to let you go.

365
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm not going to let you go.

366
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I'm not going to let you go.

367
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
I'm not going to let you go.

368
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I'm not going to let you go.

369
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
My duty is to help you to save the Emperor.

370
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Princess Niuying,

371
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
what else do you have to say?

372
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Even if I die,

373
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
I won't die in the hands of the Zaozu.

374
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Master, are you okay?

375
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Do you know who he is?

376
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
If you help him,

377
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
you will regret it in the future.

378
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I only know that

379
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
he is the Qingchi Commandant

380
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
who has been protecting Shuozhou City from foreign enemies.

381
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Young man,

382
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
you entered Shuozhou City

383
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
before the Eagle Division took over the city, right?

384
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
So now you should know

385
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
that the Governor is injured.

386
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
The safety of the people of Shuozhou City

387
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,760
is all up to the Commandant Li.

388
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
So I can't let you hurt him.

389
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
If you insist on helping him,

390
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
then we'll see.

391
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Thank you, Qin Lang.

392
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Qin Lang,

393
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I have an idea.

394
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
We can get out.

395
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
When we were driving on the water,

396
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
we had already taken over the city

397
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
and went to Wuding River for water.

398
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Master, let me go.

399
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Your injury...

400
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Let me do it.

401
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I may be familiar with this area.

402
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Commandant Li.

403
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Commandant Li.

404
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Governor?

405
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Help me, Qin Lang.

406
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Governor, why are you here?

407
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Qin Lang told me

408
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
that you found a wet area

409
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
that can be passed through the city.

410
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
You are dressed like this.

411
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Are you going to report it to me in person?

412
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
I'm going to Wuding River.

413
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
The city is surrounded by the city.

414
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Only Wuding River is an empty room.

415
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
If I don't go now,

416
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
I'm afraid I won't have time.

417
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
I plan to go out at night

418
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
and report to the outside world.

419
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
You've been hurt badly.

420
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
You were attacked today.

421
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
You're injured.

422
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
How can I let you

423
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,760
take the risk again?

424
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Yes, Commandant Li.

425
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,760
The man today is not easy to kill.

426
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Commandant Li, let me go.

427
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Shuozhou needs you and Master.

428
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
It's said that only you can survive.

429
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Besides, I'm a guard of Master.

430
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
This is my duty.

431
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
No.

432
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
The wet area is used by the water.

433
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
It's narrow and you can't go through it.

434
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Governor, I can.

435
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
I can go through it.

436
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
A'Dou.

437
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Master, I know you're worried about me.

438
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
You don't want me to take the risk.

439
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
But you're injured all over.

440
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
If you don't have a good rest,

441
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
how can you go on?

442
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
You don't want to fall on the road

443
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
and get into trouble.

444
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
So I'll go to the right place.

445
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Please trust me.

446
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
I won't let you down.

447
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Stop fooling around.

448
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
You're just a kid.

449
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
How can I let you take the risk?

450
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
It's because I'm young.

451
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
So I don't attract their attention.

452
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Besides,

453
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
why did my master take me as a disciple?

454
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
It's because I'm smart.

455
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
I've been with my master for so long.

456
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
I've learned a lot of tricks.

457
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
But when I come back,

458
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,760
the governor will give me a head-to-head in the camp.

459
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Master, don't hesitate.

460
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
We've been through so much together.

461
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Don't you believe I can handle it?

462
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Okay.

463
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
You must take this bag.

464
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
There's a escape route in the bag.

465
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:30,740
And some

466
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Wait for me.

467
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Li Duwei,

468
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
you've really taken a good disciple.

469
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
I didn't teach him anything.

470
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,760
But I'm lucky to meet him.

471
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Tegin,

472
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
our men followed Mu Jin.

473
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
He threw us off the road.

474
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
But he went to Dai Zhou.

475
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Dai Zhou?

476
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
What does it mean?

477
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Did Great Khan take Dai Zhou down?

478
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
What's going on?

479
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Why?

480
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
What's going on?

481
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Why?

482
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
I don't know what's going on.

483
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
No one takes me seriously?

484
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Tegin, don't be so arrogant.

485
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I'll take people to watch Ashile Sun.

486
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I won't let him deceive Great Khan.

487
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
It's my credit to fight alone.

488
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Enough.

489
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Stop talking nonsense.

490
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Get out.

491
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Get out.

492
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Yuanniang.

493
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
You're finally back.

494
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,760
The people in the city sent food.

495
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
They said they would eat well

496
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,760
and let the governor and soldiers in the city eat.

497
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
I sent them back.

498
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Those are the food the people saved.

499
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I really can't bear it.

500
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Madam, you did a good job.

501
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Aunt.

502
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
They all said,

503
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
they all said,

504
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
thanks to you,

505
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,760
they could save Shuozhou.

506
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
You're praising me again.

507
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
But I think

508
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Shuozhou is because of them.

509
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
That's why it exists.

510
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
It has nothing to do with me.

511
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
It's not your credit.

512
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Yes.

513
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Send all the food and food

514
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
we have in our mansion

515
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
to the people.

516
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
You must keep Doudou alive.

517
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Yes.

518
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Go.

519
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Siqin.

520
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
We killed the Tang army

521
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
who were in the back of the Dazhou.

522
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Where are the people who escaped?

523
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Three of them.

524
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Good.

525
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Envoy of the Eagle Division sent people from Shuozhou.

526
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
The Great Khan asked us to go to pick them up.

527
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Go back and find them.

528
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Don't let the people of Eagle Division know.

529
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Yes.

530
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Oh, no.

531
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
The west road is blocked.

532
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
I can't get any news from Chang'an.

533
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Dazhou is also lost.

534
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
There is no reinforcements.

535
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
What should we do?

536
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I have to go back

537
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
and send a message to my master.

538
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Go.

539
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
You guys

540
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
get some clothes of the Tang army.

541
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
When you leave Dazhou,

542
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
change them on the way.

543
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Yes.

544
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Go.

545
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Go.

546
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Go.

547
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Go.

548
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Come on.

549
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Come on.

550
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Come on.

551
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,240
Please spare us!

552
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,280
Please spare us!

553
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,240
Please spare us!

554
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,480
Kneel down.

555
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,280
Why should we kneel down?

556
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,840
It's because they caused us to be in this state.

557
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,960
Kneel down, you!

558
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,800
Please spare us!

559
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,200
Please spare us!

560
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,840
No!

561
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,080
No!

562
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,480
Stop!

563
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Who are you?

564
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,800
It's fine if you can't recognize me.

565
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,280
You know the Wolf's Teeth Clan, right?

566
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,360
When did Eagle Division

567
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,800
take care of our Wolf King?

568
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,360
Get out if you know the truth.

569
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,400
You know the power of Eagle Division.

570
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,840
If you lose your life for these refugees,

571
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,080
it's not worth it.

572
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,080
Retreat!

573
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,000
Retreat!

574
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Retreat!

575
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Retreat!

576
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Retreat!

577
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Retreat!

578
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
You guys leave too.

579
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
It's urgent!

580
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
It's urgent!

581
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
It's urgent!

582
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
It's urgent!

583
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
It's urgent in Shuozhou.

584
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Let's hurry up.

585
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Yes!

586
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Go!

587
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Great!

588
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Aunt!

589
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Go!

590
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Go!

591
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Isn't this the little monkey

592
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,080
who is with whom?

593
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Yes.

594
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
I'll stop you.

595
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
Kill him.

596
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Kill him.

597
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Wait!

598
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Your Majesty!

599
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
I have a request.

600
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
Your Majesty!

601
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I have a request to tell you.

602
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
What?

603
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Call me Tegin.

604
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Yes.

605
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Tegin.

606
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
You called me wrong.

607
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
Kill him.

608
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Kill him.

609
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Tegin must be anxious now.

610
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
He wants to know the situation in Shuozhou.

611
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Give me a life.

612
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
I will be useful to Tegin.

613
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Tell me what you want.

614
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Or I'll kill you.

615
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Tegin must know

616
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
that I'm a close friend of the head of the Li's.

617
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I know his tricks better than anyone.

618
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
In the battle with Wu Ding,

619
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Tegin killed so many people.

620
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
How can we fight them?

621
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I heard that

622
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
Ying Shi is the one who is leading the battle.

623
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Go to hell!

624
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
That's right!

625
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
I'm the one who is leading the battle.

626
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
I'm the one who is leading the battle.

627
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
I'm the one who is leading the battle.

628
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Damn you!

629
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Stop talking nonsense!

630
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
You want to kill me by catching him?

631
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Go! Go! Go!

632
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
If Tegin can control the soldiers,

633
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
how can he not know that

634
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
the head of the Li's has been promoted to the commander?

635
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Tegin, please leave me.

636
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Let me negotiate with Shuozhou.

637
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
I can make Li Duwei

638
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
to give Shuozhou the victory.

639
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Now,

640
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
even a little monkey like you

641
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
dare to lie to me.

642
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Am I a liar?

643
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Am I?

644
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
The bastard in the Sima Street lied to you.

645
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Tegin didn't know that

646
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
Li Duwei and Gongsun were going to die.

647
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Ying Shi was seriously injured.

648
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Now is the best time to negotiate.

649
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
As far as I know,

650
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,080
no one is more suitable to negotiate than me.

651
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Ying Shi has been fighting for so long.

652
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
In Shuozhou,

653
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
he is still determined to fight against Ouyang.

654
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
He has taken every step.

655
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Even if I can't persuade him,

656
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
I can still make a big mistake

657
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
in Shuozhou's morale.

658
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Ying Shi

659
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
can never do that.

660
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
I'll be careful with him this time.

661
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
After he is in charge of the army,

662
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
I'll be careful with him.

663
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Don't get hurt.

664
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Stay alive.

665
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Yes.

666
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
The Great Khan ordered that

667
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
whoever dares to act rashly should be killed.

668
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
My lady,

669
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
you can't use this.

670
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
My lady.

671
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Put it on.

672
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
My lady, you are so kind.

673
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
You saved me with kindness.

674
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
If only my daughter

675
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
could have such a good life like mine.

676
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
My lady, you have to live well.

677
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Maybe you can see your daughter.

678
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Maybe you can see your daughter.

679
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Tegin, Ying Shi cleaned up the battlefield.

680
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
He got a lot of Dai Zhou's military clothing.

681
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
And on the way,

682
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Mu Jin ordered Ying Shi's people

683
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
to change into Tang army uniforms.

684
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Tegin.

685
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Ying Shi is going to take the lead.

686
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Gather the Xiong Shi.

687
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Hurry up.

688
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
I want to meet you again

689
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:10,080
before we say goodbye

690
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,080
I want to hold your figure

691
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,080
in my tender dream

692
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,080
Before dawn

693
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,080
I want to keep missing you

694
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,080
There is always a moment

695
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,080
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

696
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,080
There is always a moment

697
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
that is between you and me

698
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,080
and it is all in front of me

699
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,080
In different worlds

700
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
In different worlds

701
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,080
I miss you more and more

702
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,080
I miss you more and more

703
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,080
I miss you more and more

704
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,080
I miss you more and more

705
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,080
There is always a moment

706
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:23,080
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

707
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,080
There is always a moment

708
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,080
that is between you and me

709
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,080
and it is all in front of me

710
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
In different worlds

711
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
In different worlds

712
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,080
I miss you more and more

713
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,080
I miss you more and more

714
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,080
I miss you more and more

715
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I miss you more and more

716
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:03,080
I miss you more and more
