1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning with him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life, the river of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Can you still move?

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Chief Du, the bowmen have been attacked.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Listen to my order.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Leave this matter to me.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Master Li?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The village is short, the pond is long.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What the dukong is not good at is to be a man.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are not good at it.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I am not good at it.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am not good at it.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am not good at it.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am not good at it.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am not good at it.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What the dukong is not good at is to give up.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you think I am doing?

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I have been working for 18 years, I have not even seen your face.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Liuyun Temple can actually shake the big fight of Yaoshi?

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have a good apprentice.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I haven't taught him yet.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If the snake is inside, I will lose a lot.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Today, I can have you two to accompany me.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I am already late.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ashile Sun, how dare you stand outside?

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Big eyes kill small eyes.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's him.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's him.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's him.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Who?

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Soldiers, listen to my order.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tang San 367, go forward.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Tang Si 2367, retreat.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Attack.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Brother Cheng, leave everything to me.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't worry.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Kill.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Soldiers, return.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Tang Yi 34, go forward.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Tang Si 45, retreat.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Wu Gui Bu, run away.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Kill.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't let him run away.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ashile Sun,

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
are you worthy of the Great Khan who raised you for so many years?

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He is worthy.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He is helping Ashile Tribe.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,320
The relationship between Li Tang and Ashile Tribe

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
is not easy to be restored.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,960
But you insist on bringing about a new crisis.

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,320
Do you really treat the lives of both sides

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
as if they were a piece of grass?

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,080
I've made a great contribution to the city.

63
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm a great ambassador.

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,880
I don't care about the details.

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,880
If you step aside now,

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,600
I can help you

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,720
to cover up for this matter in front of Great Khan.

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Otherwise,

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
you and your Eagle Division

70
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
will be punished by heaven.

71
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,120
Shut up!

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,080
Ashile Sun,

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
are you really going to help Du Ruhui and the others

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,480
and betray Ashile Tribe?

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,520
You're lying again.

76
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm just a person who cares about myself.

77
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,440
I didn't betray Ashile Tribe.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
But you did this

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,280
to stir up the dispute between Ashile Tribe and Great Tang.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,760
This is what makes the grassland

81
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
fall into the fire.

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,960
Do you think you can hide

83
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
Great Khan from me?

84
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,840
Ashile Sun,

85
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
the soldiers of Great Tang

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
won't let you off.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,640
Guards.

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
Take Madam away.

89
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,960
Yes.

90
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,160
The number of people hasn't been counted.

91
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
You don't have to scare yourself.

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Where is she?

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
What do you mean?

94
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
She's not here.

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
She's not here.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
Of course.

97
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
She's the one who cooperated with me.

98
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,760
I was the one who cooperated with you.

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

100
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,440
Don't we look alike?

101
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,560
Do you know each other?

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,880
We've known each other for a long time.

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Right, Brother Li?

104
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Yes.

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,080
We've known each other for a long time.

106
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Duke Du won't understand

107
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
such a fate.

108
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,680
Chief Hou, we've found her.

109
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,640
Father,

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
there's no one in the backyard.

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,000
Since the beginning,

112
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,960
only Chief and I are here.

113
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,400
I wonder who

114
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,120
Minister Du is looking for.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,640
You're overreacting.

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,640
I've offended you before.

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,280
Please forgive me.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
I almost died

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,240
to save you.

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,280
You should take care of yourself.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Don't keep thinking about it.

122
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,640
You need to rest

123
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
after you're injured.

124
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
I'll send someone

125
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
to take care of everything in the temple.

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
Please forgive me.

127
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,680
Please forgive me.

128
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,120
Your quality is very good.

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,960
In my dreams,

130
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,280
I delivered the tea

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,760
to the right place.

132
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,080
I swear

133
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,040
I'll give youberry tea.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
I'll sell it to others.

135
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,240
As long as Mo Junwhere does this,

136
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,800
you'll consider?

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,880
Dear steps,

138
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,600
The current situation of Duke Du

139
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,640
is really making people

140
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,680
more and more confused.

141
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,360
Who are you looking for?

142
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
How could you let go like this?

143
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm not concerned with you

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
in the court.

145
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,600
But I don't understand

146
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,320
your strange behavior.

147
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,760
Good.

148
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,320
I just helped you to teach the bandits

149
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
and you're so quick to turn a blind eye.

150
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,840
You're not a doctor now.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,440
Of course you don't have the qualification to come here.

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,960
Unless you're willing to

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,120
change your clothes and return to the temple.

154
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
Are you trying to trick me again?

155
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,240
Fine. I won't say it.

156
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,480
I don't care.

157
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
Anyway, the things in the temple

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,560
are too complicated to be clear.

159
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
You're the one who wants to catch him.

160
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,400
You're the one who wants to release him.

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,680
You can't figure it out yourself.

162
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,800
Stop talking nonsense.

163
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,440
You're so powerful.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,120
Now the most important thing is to find the Crown Prince

165
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
and the bandits in the city.

166
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,040
They should know

167
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,560
where the Crown Prince is.

168
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
Father,

169
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,240
I'll let them block the city gate

170
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
and search the city.

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
Wait.

172
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm a doctor,

173
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,120
but I still can't help but say it.

174
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
You're making such a big noise.

175
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,840
Aren't you afraid of disturbing the mood?

176
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
What do you mean?

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,040
You're so impatient that you'll jump the wall.

178
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,440
If the Crown Prince is really in the hands of these people,

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,440
what do you think will happen?

180
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,640
It's such a big deal.

181
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I think they won't stay long.

182
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,440
It's not wrong to guard the city gate.

183
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
There are so many people coming there.

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,440
We can't check them one by one.

185
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,840
Moreover, you just saw it.

186
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
They are all ordinary people.

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
And hungry refugees.

188
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
How can you check them?

189
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,640
Duke Du,

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I have a way

191
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
to stop the snake from attacking us.

192
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
Please tell me.

193
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,400
I can find those

194
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,040
who are half refugees.

195
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,240
But

196
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,440
I need to get the camp.

197
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Take care of yourselves.

198
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,440
Thank you.

199
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
Take care of yourselves.

200
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
Thank you.

201
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,040
Come.

202
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,640
Come.

203
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,240
Come.

204
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,040
Come.

205
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,440
Thank you.

206
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,040
Thank you.

207
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,440
Thank you.

208
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Please take care of yourselves.

209
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
If you want to leave the city,

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
take the boat here.

211
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
Thank you.

212
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,840
Next.

213
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,440
Thank you.

214
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,840
Next.

215
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,440
Thank you.

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Thank you.

217
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,040
Thank you.

218
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,240
Next.

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
Thank you.

220
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Wait.

221
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,040
Sorry.

222
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,440
Next.

223
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,640
Even if Changge is fine,

224
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
I won't forgive you.

225
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Get in line.

226
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Next.

227
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
Follow that man.

228
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,640
Yes.

229
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
Don't move.

230
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,640
Since you are out of the city,

231
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
you are useless.

232
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,840
Go.

233
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Take him away.

234
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,640
Yes.

235
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,040
Go.

236
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,440
How is it?

237
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
We have captured him.

238
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Princess Rui is so smart.

239
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
The real one who is hungry

240
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,840
is nothing

241
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,640
compared to the soil in the porridge.

242
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Are you hurt?

243
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm hungry.

244
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,840
I'll get you something to eat later.

245
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,440
Okay?

246
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I've sent people to guard this area.

247
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
Follow the princess' plan.

248
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,840
It's not safe outside now.

249
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I'll go to the other side.

250
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,440
Okay?

251
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Okay.

252
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
I'll go to the other side.

253
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,640
Okay.

254
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
I'll go to the other side.

255
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll send you back first.

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Since we have captured him,

257
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,240
we don't need to bother Commander Hao.

258
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,240
Go.

259
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
Find a brother to get you something to eat.

260
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Mr. Wei.

261
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,240
How is it?

262
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,040
Something happened

263
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,240
when we were cleaning the body.

264
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,040
But it seems to be nothing.

265
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,440
Is there anything or not?

266
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
I heard that a soldier

267
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,840
saw a body moving.

268
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
Then Commander Hao went to check it.

269
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
When he came back,

270
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,240
he scolded the soldier so hard

271
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,440
that he was blind.

272
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,640
But

273
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
it's not like what Commander Hao did.

274
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
He always

275
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,440
would rather kill a thousand

276
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,040
than let one go.

277
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
Commander Hao is a man of his word.

278
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Don't be careless.

279
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
I dare not.

280
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,240
Get up.

281
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
This matter has been settled.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Mind your mouth.

283
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't mention it again.

284
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,040
Yes.

285
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,040
You may leave.

286
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,840
Changge.

287
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,440
It's good that you escaped safely.

288
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,840
Your companion

289
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
is really helpless.

290
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Minister Du.

291
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
This witch...

292
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,840
It's okay.

293
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,640
Yes.

294
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,440
It seems that Madam

295
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,040
has a good intention.

296
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
I wonder if you are willing to

297
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
let her escape.

298
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,640
I wonder if you are willing

299
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,640
to talk to me.

300
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
You know what?

301
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
When my grandfather and I

302
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,840
came to Luoyang,

303
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,440
we liked Luoyang peonies the most.

304
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,240
We could see them

305
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,240
in the flowers.

306
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
I was thinking

307
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,440
that I should be like the peonies

308
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
and be the most beautiful

309
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
and the most dazzling one.

310
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
You can be contented.

311
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,440
Now, all Luoyang people know

312
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,040
that a witch

313
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,640
has been harming the people

314
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
in Liuyun Temple.

315
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,240
Tell me.

316
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
Who are you?

317
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,440
What is your motive?

318
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,240
I forgot to introduce you to Minister Du.

319
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I am from the Yang family of Hongnong.

320
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
I am Yang Su of Jinwu Palace.

321
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,240
He is my grandfather.

322
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,040
So you are a traitor

323
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
who never dies.

324
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,640
I will be the leader of Central Plains

325
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,040
sooner or later.

326
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,840
You are a good girl.

327
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,440
I will be the leader of Central Plains.

328
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
You are a muddle-headed woman.

329
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,240
You are so arrogant.

330
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,840
I advise you

331
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
not to waste your energy.

332
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,640
I am arrogant, right?

333
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
Minister Du, please wait and see.

334
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,640
You have a accomplice.

335
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,040
Or

336
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,640
you are just

337
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
following orders.

338
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,640
Since it's a game,

339
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
it's boring to say it out.

340
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,240
Now you are

341
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
keeping the secret of the party in the city.

342
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I advise you to be practical.

343
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,840
If you tell me the truth,

344
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,440
I will make the right decision.

345
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,240
I can also decide to spare your life.

346
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,240
If I am afraid of death,

347
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,840
I won't come here.

348
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
Okay.

349
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Then I will

350
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,040
let you die.

351
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,640
Lu entire hanged himself while I closed the door.

352
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,040
This is a inconsistent time.

353
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Fengyi is here.

354
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,040
Close the door .

355
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,840
You covered the door carefully.

356
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,320
Attendant,

357
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,040
a car accident.

358
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,760
Shoot him  sürer.

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,640
Let me study.

360
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,320
Hao Du,

361
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,120
where is that?

362
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,440
It's the inn we live in.

363
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,840
Don't worry. It's safe.

364
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
It doesn't matter if you chase me or not.

365
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,520
Here's the medicine.

366
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,760
It's from Dr. Sun.

367
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,520
Here.

368
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,200
Drink it while it's warm.

369
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,160
Chang Ge is injured.

370
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,200
It might not be convenient.

371
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,720
I'll do it.

372
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I just took this medicine.

373
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,120
I...

374
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,800
I just took it.

375
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,520
I'll do it myself.

376
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,960
Are you okay?

377
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,640
Are you okay?

378
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm fine.

379
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,440
Let me do it.

380
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,640
Leave it to me.

381
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,960
18.

382
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,280
You're easily hurt and merciless.

383
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,600
Leave it to her.

384
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,560
Don't move.

385
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,280
I'll do it myself.

386
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,160
What's so funny?

387
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,640
Drink it.

388
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
It's so hard to drink.

389
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,440
When can I drink it?

390
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,560
Slow down.

391
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,240
It's so bitter.

392
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
You're still

393
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,440
not bitter enough.

394
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,120
Do you have to comfort me like this?

395
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
What do you want to comfort me?

396
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,920
Sun.

397
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,520
Did we forget something?

398
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,720
What's wrong?

399
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,480
Li Cheng Qian.

400
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,000
He...

401
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,960
Where did Li Cheng Qian go?

402
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,960
He's making me worried.

403
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,760
The crown prince is the crown prince.

404
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
He'll be fine.

405
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,800
Your Highness.

406
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,440
Mr. Wei.

407
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,040
Someone sent a letter.

408
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,760
Let me see.

409
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
Go tell Minister Du

410
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
that I took the letter.

411
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,600
Yes.

412
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
It's Chang Ge's handwriting.

413
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,920
East Market Corp.

414
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
Find my brother.

415
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,520
Wait.

416
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Luoyang is in chaos now.

417
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,240
It's possible that it's a trap.

418
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,840
I can't ignore your safety.

419
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,640
But...

420
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,360
Call Hao Du and go with him.

421
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
When did you trust Hao Du so much?

422
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,480
At least,

423
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,120
you can be safer.

424
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,120
I can make concessions.

425
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,520
But I can't let you risk your life.

426
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,360
Brother Shuyu will always be my protector.

427
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,160
Hao Du.

428
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,800
The crown prince has news.

429
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,080
Li Chang Ge

430
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,480
is helping the crown prince.

431
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,560
He's so cruel.

432
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,560
He's locked up in such a place.

433
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,360
Chengqian.

434
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,360
Let me see.

435
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,800
What's going on?

436
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,840
Hao Du.

437
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Take someone to seal this place.

438
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Arrest them all.

439
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,320
No one can escape.

440
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Chengqian.

441
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,440
Are you deaf?

442
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,640
Your Highness.

443
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,320
Since you're fine,

444
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,760
it's a big deal.

445
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,880
No.

446
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,280
I must vent my anger.

447
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,920
I must seal this place right now.

448
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,000
You...

449
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,800
How dare you disobey me?

450
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,720
Sister.

451
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
They're all on my head.

452
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,680
You don't care?

453
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,840
All right, brother.

454
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
You're the crown prince.

455
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,200
How can you be so easy?

456
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,200
Go back with me.

457
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,200
And Li Chang Ge.

458
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
I must catch him.

459
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,040
I must make him beg for life and death.

460
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
You saw Chang Ge?

461
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
He's the one who locked me up here.

462
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,440
He's a bad person.

463
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,200
Minister Du is waiting for you in the government office.

464
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,800
You'd better go back with the princess.

465
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,240
Fine.

466
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,040
You're so playful.

467
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,920
You even threw me here.

468
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll tell Minister Du...

469
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
to arrest Li Chang Ge.

470
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,240
Chang Ge was right.

471
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,360
If it were me,

472
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,120
I'd throw you into the pigsty.

473
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,760
You're still thinking about it?

474
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,200
No.

475
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm bored at night.

476
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,760
I'm here to get some sleep.

477
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,600
You...

478
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,280
Before Li Cheng,

479
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,240
you were the crown prince.

480
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,120
You were so careless and mischievous.

481
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,040
You made Luoyang a mess.

482
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,600
You...

483
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,480
You're so illegal.

484
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,560
And

485
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,560
you said who was the bitch.

486
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,040
It was your cousin.

487
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,000
Sister.

488
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,360
You hit me.

489
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
You hit me for Li Chang Ge.

490
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,640
Why don't you love your brother?

491
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm hitting you?

492
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,760
You're so stingy.

493
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,560
I...

494
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,680
Leyan.

495
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Li Cheng.

496
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,640
Leyan.

497
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,280
Come here.

498
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,360
What are you doing?

499
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,200
Come out, Li Cheng.

500
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,760
Forget it.

501
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,360
Come here.

502
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,000
Forget it.

503
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
Li Cheng, you're being beaten by Li Chang Ge.

504
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm going back to tell A Yan.

505
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,240
You...

506
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,040
Come here.

507
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,760
Brother Shuyu, don't stop me.

508
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,680
I'll teach him a lesson today.

509
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,480
Come here.

510
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,640
You're being beaten by Li Chang Ge.

511
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,320
Come here.

512
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,560
Sister, stop it.

513
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,480
I was wrong.

514
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,480
Brother Shuyu, save me.

515
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,640
Leyan, forget it.

516
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,600
Someone's watching.

517
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,720
Li Cheng.

518
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm warning you.

519
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,680
You'd better go back and be more reserved.

520
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,120
If you dare to mention Li Chang Ge to anyone,

521
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,760
I'll break your legs.

522
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
No, no, no.

523
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,760
I've never seen him.

524
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Brother Shuyu, let's go.

525
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,400
But the Crown Prince...

526
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,800
Hao Du, send the Crown Prince back.

527
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Remember.

528
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,000
If he dares to say one more word,

529
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,320
I'll beat him to death.

530
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,240
No.

531
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,440
No.

532
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Here comes the merchant team.

533
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,400
Here comes the merchant team.

534
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
Mimi.

535
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,960
Here comes the merchant team.

536
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,400
They brought a lot of goods.

537
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,680
Let me show you around.

538
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,040
Mimi, it's too late if you don't go.

539
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,520
Where is he?

540
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,440
Forget it.

541
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,080
I'll go and pick some for you.

542
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,840
You scared me.

543
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
I'll go and pick some for you.

544
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
I'll go and pick some for you.

545
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,840
I'll go and pick some for you.

546
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
I'll go and pick some for you.

547
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,440
Okay.

548
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,280
Little girl, hurry up.

549
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,200
Come out and eat.

550
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Come out and eat.

551
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Come on. Come here.

552
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,920
Come here.

553
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,680
Come here.

554
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,360
Let's go out.

555
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,960
Come on.

556
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,520
Let's go.

557
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's go.

558
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,960
Hurry up.

559
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,760
Let's go.

560
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,520
Little brother.

561
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
Little brother.

562
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,520
Wake up.

563
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
Little brother.

564
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,480
Little brother.

565
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,880
Help me.

566
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Who are you?

567
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,000
Why are you here?

568
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,720
Wake up.

569
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,760
Where did you come from?

570
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,600
It's so hot.

571
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,080
No.

572
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,440
I have to find a big house to help you.

573
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,120
You're awake.

574
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Master, let me remind you.

575
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,200
What...

576
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,120
What did you say?

577
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,240
He told you not to forget the mission.

578
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,920
He community.

579
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,000
Who are you?

580
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,760
Who sent you here?

581
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,440
Why are you here?

582
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,040
Master ordered you

583
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,520
to spare me.

584
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Help me.

585
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Help me.

586
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Sister.

587
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Otherwise,

588
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
you would kill me.

589
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
You...

590
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
The master said

591
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
if you didn't listen,

592
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
you would know the consequences.

593
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Mimi, are you in there?

594
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Mimi.

595
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
I'm coming in.

596
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,760
What are you yelling at this early morning?

597
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
A business team came by.

598
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I wanted to take you to pick some good stuff.

599
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
But you weren't there.

600
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
So I went alone.

601
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I went to the sheep farm every morning.

602
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
You went to the sheep farm?

603
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I have something good for you.

604
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Let's go in and have a look.

605
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Can't I talk to you outside?

606
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Mimi,

607
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
are you blaming me for going alone

608
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
for not taking you with me?

609
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
No.

610
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
I'm afraid I'll be late.

611
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Su Yishe and his team will take everything.

612
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
I said no.

613
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Mimi,

614
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
how about I take you out for a walk?

615
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
All the flowers in our camp are blooming.

616
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
They're beautiful.

617
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
They're very pretty.

618
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Let's go.

619
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Let's go.

620
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
They're really pretty.

621
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
You'll know when you get there.

622
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Go.

623
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
This is it.

624
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Why did you bring me here?

625
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
What?

626
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
You don't like this place?

627
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
No.

628
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
I like it.

629
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
By the way,

630
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
you came to see me just now.

631
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Didn't you want to give me something?

632
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
What is this?

633
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Open it and have a look.

634
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Open it.

635
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Candy?

636
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Where did you get it?

637
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
I changed it with the shopkeeper.

638
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Do you like it?

639
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Try it.

640
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
It's sweet.

641
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Why don't you eat it?

642
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
How can I eat something like this?

643
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
I have to treasure it.

644
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
It'll be sweet.

645
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Moji,

646
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
thank you.

647
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
You're welcome.

648
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
As long as you like it,

649
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
I'll buy it for you from now on.

650
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Mingming,

651
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
I like you.

652
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Do you know why I brought you here?

653
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Because I heard that

654
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
as long as you come to this bridge with the one you like,

655
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
they'll be together forever.

656
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
I want to be with you forever.

657
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I want to be with you forever.

658
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I want to be with you forever.

659
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I want to be with you forever.

660
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
I want to be with you forever.

661
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
I want to be with you forever.

662
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

663
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm telling the truth.

664
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I really like you very much.

665
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Moji,

666
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
you're great.

667
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I don't deserve you.

668
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
You don't have to blame yourself.

669
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
I don't deserve you.

670
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
I'm sorry.

671
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
I'm sorry.

672
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Moji,

673
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
it hurts.

674
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
I'm sorry.

675
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
I've hurt you.

676
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Master

677
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
ordered you

678
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
to leave me.

679
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Moji,

680
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
I really don't deserve your love.

681
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Hurry up.

682
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Hurry up.

683
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Wait for me.

684
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Go.

685
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Hurry up.

686
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Hurry up.

687
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Hurry up.

688
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
Wait for me.

689
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I feel that

690
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Sun has been gone for a long time.

691
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,760
Sun was still young.

692
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Although he was afraid of me,

693
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
he always kept pestering me

694
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
and asked me to teach him martial arts.

695
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
But now...

696
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Kehan has been feeling unwell recently.

697
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
You'd better drink less.

698
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Who told you to come here?

699
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Leave.

700
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Then Kehan,

701
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
take the medicine.

702
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
I haven't been to Eagle Division for a long time.

703
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I haven't met Sun for a while.

704
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
If I knew it,

705
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
we shouldn't have

706
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
been suspicious.

707
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
If he comes back now,

708
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
I'll reward him heavily.

709
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm asking you,

711
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,760
are you coming back?

712
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Jinse.

713
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Your Highness.

714
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
You did a good job.

715
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
I just want to torture you

716
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
in front of Yan Li.

717
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
The more you humiliate me,

718
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
the more people in the grasslands

719
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
will pity me.

720
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
When everyone

721
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
is not prepared for me,

722
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
it's the best time

723
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
for me to attack.

724
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Do you understand?

725
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Yes.

726
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Get up.

727
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Your Highness.

728
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Your Highness.

729
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
You've been wronged.

730
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
It's nothing

731
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
to be wronged.

732
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
You're my capable leader.

733
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Don't let me down.

734
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Your Highness.

735
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
I won't let you down

736
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
at any cost.

737
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
I won't let you die.

738
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
It's...

739
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
I'm useless.

740
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
It's Jinse.

741
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
I'm useless.

742
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Your Highness.

743
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Did that child

744
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
arrive at the Eagle Division?

745
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Your Highness,

746
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
he's here.

747
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760
But I underestimated Yan Li's

748
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
feelings for Ashile Sun.

749
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I didn't expect that he still

750
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
cares about that son.

751
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
I encouraged Li Changge

752
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
to save Luo Yi

753
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
and asked A'Yi to help him.

754
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
I wanted to find a chance

755
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
to kill A'Yi.

756
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
But I was too happy.

757
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
It's a pity that

758
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
I was too soft-hearted

759
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
and left this bad mark.

760
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Your Highness, you were

761
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
on the edge of danger.

762
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Luckily, A'Yi's death

763
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
was not a proof.

764
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Otherwise...

765
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Otherwise what?

766
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Luo Yi is a traitor of the Sui Dynasty.

767
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I have a saying

768
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
that can clear the suspicion.

769
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
By the way,

770
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
is there any news about Luo Yang?

771
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
No.

772
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
No news?

773
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I'm afraid it's the worst news.

774
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
It seems that

775
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Jinse has failed most of the time.

776
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
We should act fast.

777
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
While Ashile Sun is still alive,

778
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
we should start what we should.

779
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Your Highness, don't worry.

780
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
In the past two months,

781
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
I've followed your orders

782
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
to keep an eye on our men.

783
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
By Yan Li's side?

784
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
He is a great man.

785
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
It won't be long.

786
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,760
My heart gradually responds

787
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
and gradually awakens

788
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,760
I'm slowly missing you

789
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Before saying goodbye

790
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm looking forward to it

791
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,760
I remember your figure

792
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,760
locked in my dream of longing

793
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Years and years

794
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
year after year

795
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
I miss you

796
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,760
There is always a moment

797
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,760
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

798
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,760
There is always a moment

799
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,760
that we meet each other

800
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,760
in the world

801
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
In each other's world

802
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
In each other's world

803
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
In each other's world

804
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I'm slowly missing you

805
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,760
After years and years

806
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,760
time after time

807
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
I miss you

808
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,760
I remember your figure

809
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,760
locked in my dream of longing

810
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
years and years

811
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
year after year

812
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I miss you

813
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,760
The light of the world

814
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,760
There is always a sense of attachment

815
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,760
Between you and me, everything is tomorrow

816
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,760
In different worlds, in different worlds

817
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,760
My wish is coming true

818
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,760
Don't miss it, don't think about it forever

819
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,760
The light of the universe

820
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Immortal

821
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,760
The light of the universe
