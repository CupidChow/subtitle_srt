1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
To the distance

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
The past is broken into pieces

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Follow the light

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Forget you

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
This is the look of a stubborn person

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,920
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,920
To sing a song for him

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,920
He is the river of life and the light of hope

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,920
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Episode 16

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Excuse me for the guests.

15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Are you from the Central Plains?

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Please help me check this jingpa.

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Is it a weapon of the royal family?

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,920
You may not have seen the things of the royal family in the Central Plains.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Let me see.

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
This handkerchief is low quality.

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Don't say it's royal.

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Even if it's for me, I feel painful.

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
You.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Good.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
You are really a woman who is here to cheat people.

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Follow me to see the leader.

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Go.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
You save me.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
You still dare to say.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Master Jiao, do we need to help her?

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Look at the girl's speech and behavior.

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
And her clothes.

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Not rich and expensive.

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Even if we don't help her,

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
there will be others to help her.

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Master.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Something is not right.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Even the most hidden black silk and purple grass.

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,920
They have taken it.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
It seems that this tent is going to be destroyed.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
What should we do?

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Where should we find the purple grass?

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Let's stay here and continue to find.

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
No matter what, we must take the purple grass back.

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
OK.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Go.

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Let go.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
I didn't cheat.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
I just took a break.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Go.

52
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Why are you so unreasonable?

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Go.

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I didn't cheat.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
You are young and don't pay for food and water.

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
You can't believe it.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I didn't.

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Go.

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Go.

60
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Go to him.

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
He has money.

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
He can't.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
You can't leave without money.

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Take it.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Thank you.

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Thank you.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
My stomach hurts.

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Uncle.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
You want to die?

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
You...

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
You escaped in this way last time.

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
My head hurts.

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
My head hurts.

74
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
You said your head hurts last time.

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
I was the one who cheated you.

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Uncle.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
This joke is not funny at all.

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
That's enough.

79
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Can you go?

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I can go with you.

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
But I'm hungry.

82
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
I want to eat noodles.

83
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
You just finished it.

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Can't I?

85
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Here is your noodles.

86
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Please enjoy.

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
You all look at me like this.

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
How can I eat it?

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Delicious.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
It's really delicious.

91
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I...

92
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
My stomach hurts.

93
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
What's wrong?

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
There must be something wrong with this noodles.

95
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Something wrong.

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Come in.

97
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Sir.

98
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Sir.

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
There must be something wrong with your noodles.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Impossible.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Sir.

102
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
What's going on?

103
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
This is our restaurant.

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
It's impossible.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
It's not possible.

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
It's not possible.

107
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
It's not possible.

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
It's not possible.

109
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
It's the heaven.

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
There can't be such a problem.

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Is there any misunderstanding?

112
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Then go to the kitchen and have a look.

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
If I'm poisoned,

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I can find out the source of the poison.

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Go.

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Go.

117
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
You all go to the kitchen and have a look.

118
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes.

119
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
This way, please.

120
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Uncle.

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
You go too.

122
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
My stomach hurts.

123
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm going to the toilet.

124
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm going to the toilet.

125
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
My stomach hurts.

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
She ran away again.

127
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Go after her.

128
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
It's you.

129
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
The Lu Village of Yuan Family.

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
The Lu Village of Yuan Family.

131
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
You lied to us just now.

132
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Why do you fall in love with us?

133
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Enough.

134
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Don't bother with her.

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
No, she...

136
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Go.

137
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Move aside.

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Move aside.

139
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Move aside.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
She found me.

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
There are soldiers.

142
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Are they the soldiers of Mobei City?

143
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Are you afraid of soldiers?

144
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Stop.

145
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Help.

146
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Hurry up.

147
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Beat him.

148
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Go.

149
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Hurry up.

150
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Go after her.

151
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Yes.

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Take care.

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Let's go inside and have some food.

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
This way, please.

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Okay.

156
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Who are you?

157
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Why are you kidnapping me?

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Who are you?

159
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Why are you causing us trouble?

160
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Why should I tell you?

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Besides,

162
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
you are weird.

163
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
And you are afraid of soldiers.

164
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
In my opinion,

165
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
you are not a regular person

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
who does business.

167
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Since you've seen it,

168
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I won't talk to you anymore.

169
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm not a regular person.

170
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I'm not a regular person.

171
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I won't talk to you anymore.

172
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
You caused us trouble.

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Do you know the consequences?

174
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Do you want to kill me?

175
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
This is a hotel, right?

176
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
It's not a good place

177
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
for killing people.

178
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
You are a smart girl.

179
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Tell me.

180
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Who are those people who are after you?

181
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Enemies?

182
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
You should tie me up.

183
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
It's better to be caught

184
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
by those people

185
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
than to be followed by you.

186
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
You are a woman.

187
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
You are not telling the truth.

188
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
I really don't dare

189
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
to let you go out

190
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
and cause trouble for us.

191
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Stay here.

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
If you don't listen to me,

193
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
I'll throw you out in the wild

194
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
and call the wolves to eat you.

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Changge, how is it going?

196
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Who is he?

197
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
You still don't want to tell me?

198
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
How do we deal with him?

199
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Although he has no clear background,

200
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
he is not a wicked person.

201
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
But he is very sensitive.

202
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
He has already seen that

203
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
we are not dealing with the government.

204
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
If we let him go now,

205
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I'm afraid we will cause trouble again.

206
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

207
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I'll go with you.

208
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll go with you.

209
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
I'll go with you.

210
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

211
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
We'll talk about it later.

212
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
You are right.

213
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Let's do it.

214
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You want to trap me?

215
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
You want to trap me?

216
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
No way.

217
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
He's waiting for me here?

218
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
I'll go with you.

219
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
I'll go with you.

220
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
What's wrong, Mimi?

221
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
What are you thinking about?

222
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm thinking about my Atahana

223
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
and my brother.

224
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
When we were young,

225
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
our whole family lived in Mobei.

226
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Although we didn't have a rich life,

227
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
we were happy.

228
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Until Ashile Tribe appeared.

229
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
After the Iron Tent,

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
our family was destroyed.

231
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Many tribesmen were lost.

232
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
But it's a good thing that Mobei King appeared.

233
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Although Mobei was preserved,

234
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Ashile Tribe still held them back.

235
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Yes.

236
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Those who have been killed

237
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
will be punished.

238
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
That's what my Atahana said.

239
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
When we were young, he told me

240
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
that right is right and wrong is wrong.

241
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
But Changge,

242
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I can't tell

243
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
what is right and what is wrong.

244
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Ashile Tribe.

245
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
I should hate Ashile Tribe.

246
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
But Eagle Division is also Ashile Tribe's.

247
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I love everyone there.

248
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Did I do something wrong?

249
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Eagle Division is different from Ashile Tribe.

250
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Aren't you tied up?

251
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
I...

252
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Why don't you go?

253
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
I didn't want to go.

254
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
But I think you're right.

255
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Ashile Tribe,

256
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
especially Great Khan,

257
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
will be punished.

258
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Who are you?

259
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
My name is Zhenzhou.

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I'm from Mo Nan.

261
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
But this is Mobei.

262
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm here to see the Qihang Festival.

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
The Qihang Festival in the desert

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
is the most lively in Mobei.

265
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
So you escaped alone.

266
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Who caught you this morning?

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Me and Atahana.

268
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
He sent those people to catch me.

269
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I didn't do anything.

270
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
But I don't want to go.

271
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
You're just a child

272
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
who ran away from home.

273
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm not a child.

274
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm already 14 years old.

275
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I can have a child.

276
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I think you're just a toy.

277
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I can let you go.

278
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
But I warn you.

279
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
If you dare to come back

280
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
and cause trouble to us,

281
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
I'll catch you

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
and kill you.

283
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
You won't kill me.

284
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Why?

285
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Intuition.

286
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
By the way,

287
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
do you have food?

288
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
I'm hungry.

289
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
You...

290
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Don't eat too much.

291
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I'm satisfied.

292
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm full.

293
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Let me ask you.

294
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
How far is Mo Nan from here?

295
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Do you have the grass in the desert?

296
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Grass?

297
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Grass is not

298
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
a rare thing in our desert.

299
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
There are many in Mobei.

300
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Why do you ask Mo Nan?

301
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Because Mobei

302
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
has no more grass.

303
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Although

304
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
grass is banned in the market,

305
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
it's not forbidden to

306
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
remove the cold.

307
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Every year on the cold festival,

308
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
everyone will take out grass

309
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
to remove the cold.

310
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Remove the cold?

311
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Mimi.

312
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Is it the same thing

313
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
you said in the day

314
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
about removing the cold?

315
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
The biggest activity on the cold festival

316
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
is removing the cold.

317
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Everyone will build a stage in the city.

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Then someone will stand on the stage

319
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
and sing and dance.

320
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
People will throw all the grass in their hands...

321
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Throw all the grass into the cold.

322
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Why didn't I think of this before?

323
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
What's the point

324
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
of your performance?

325
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
The point?

326
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Someone!

327
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Someone!

328
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Everyone in the tent

329
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
is dead, right?

330
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Where is Shi Xin and Sili?

331
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
General Shi Xin

332
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
is not in the palace now.

333
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Where is Shi Er?

334
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Tell him to come and see me.

335
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Young Khan led the Wolf Division

336
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
to check every department.

337
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
None of them are there.

338
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
None of them are there.

339
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Where are they?

340
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Khan is sick.

341
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
He should rest in peace.

342
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
When they come back,

343
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
I will report to Khan.

344
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
A'Sen.

345
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
A'Sen.

346
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
A'Sen.

347
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Princess.

348
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Khan is still thinking

349
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
about the sword of Eagle Division.

350
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Can that sword still be used?

351
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Don't worry, Princess.

352
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Someone is watching the tomb.

353
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
They will be here soon.

354
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I will go to the palace

355
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
and check the place.

356
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
I will go to the palace and check the place.

357
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I will go to the palace and check the place.

358
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
They will not be afraid.

359
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Thank you for your kind words.

360
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
We won't be in danger for now.

361
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
But

362
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
the changes of the disease

363
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
in the capital

364
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
are faster than I thought.

365
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
You mean

366
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
we may not be able to

367
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
reach the time?

368
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Since I said ten days,

369
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
I will definitely be there for ten days.

370
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
But if we can't get the

371
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Great Mozi Grass on time,

372
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
it will be hard to say.

373
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
How is it going?

374
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't worry, Qin.

375
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
It's all ready.

376
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Just wait and see.

377
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Go.

378
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Go.

379
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Go.

380
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Go.

381
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Go.

382
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Go.

383
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Go.

384
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Go.

385
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Go.

386
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Go.

387
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Over there.

388
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Over there.

389
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Over there.

390
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Go.

391
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Go.

392
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Go.

393
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Go.

394
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Go.

395
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Go.

396
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Go.

397
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Go.

398
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Go.

399
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Go.

400
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Go.

401
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Go.

402
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Go.

403
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Go.

404
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Go.

405
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Go.

406
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Go.

407
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Go.

408
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Go.

409
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Go.

410
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Go.

411
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Go.

412
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
It's Yinzhao.

413
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,800
OK.

414
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Great.

415
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Great.

416
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Cool.

417
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
It's time for complete theWolver.

418
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Complete theWolver.

419
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Fin calculating.

420
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Complete theWolver.

421
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,920
You are doing great.

422
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Complete theWolver.

423
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Complete theWolver.

424
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,320
Go, go, go, go.

425
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Go and check what these people are.

426
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,120
Yes.

427
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,760
Come on.

428
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,480
Be careful.

429
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
Qi, be careful.

430
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Are these drugs enough?

431
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,000
I've checked it.

432
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,520
They're all good for eating.

433
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,280
Leave some for them to prepare tea.

434
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,200
I see.

435
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,200
Wait.

436
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,880
You're leaving?

437
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,120
What about me?

438
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
What should I do?

439
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,240
Go home if you've had enough fun.

440
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
Don't let your father worry about you for too long.

441
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,000
My lord.

442
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
What happened?

443
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,520
Our leader wants to see you.

444
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,840
Your leader?

445
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Mo Beilang.

446
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,840
My lord.

447
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,920
We're all civilians.

448
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,120
We didn't do anything.

449
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,960
May I ask

450
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,360
why Mo Beilang wants to see us?

451
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,720
Just do it.

452
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,840
Stop talking nonsense.

453
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
Okay, okay.

454
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,360
Then

455
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,520
I'll go with you

456
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,920
and let them go.

457
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,880
Who are you?

458
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,480
We want to see all of you.

459
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Don't worry about it.

460
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,120
Let's discuss it.

461
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,080
Changge.

462
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
What should we do?

463
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,960
Now is the critical moment.

464
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,520
We can't make any mistakes.

465
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,520
If we have a conflict with Mobei's people,

466
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,520
we can't take away

467
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,640
the people and the grass.

468
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,920
You're right.

469
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,760
Then it won't be a waste of time.

470
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,280
We can only act accordingly.

471
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,160
If anything happens...

472
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
My lord, don't worry.

473
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,200
Mobei's fishing land

474
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,600
is in my heart.

475
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
If we want to break through,

476
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
the Yanxing Sect can take over at any time.

477
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,720
Okay.

478
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,040
My lord.

479
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
Let's go.

480
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,880
Please.

481
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
While night falls,

482
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,000
the incident of making a fuss

483
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,440
utilized natural magic

484
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,880
to become around in real.

485
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I think

486
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,840
his power

487
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,440
will strengthen

488
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
our moral order.

489
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,600
I have strong Kayu idea.

490
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,520
In a way,

491
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,280
we can't mission plan

492
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,920
any other day.

493
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,000
My lord.

494
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,840
Any other choice?

495
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,840
For that,

496
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,600
I'll send the chewed fish

497
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,760
as a reward tonight.

498
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
Are you the leader of Mobei?

499
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,560
I'm personally the leader.

500
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,240
You can not do many things here.

501
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,560
Once, I was part of Mu Xia's gang.

502
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,640
Once this happened,

503
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,960
I was definitely under his command.

504
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,240
No.

505
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,240
I don't mind.

506
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,800
You are the leader of Mobei,

507
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
the Bodhisattva of Yaoluo Pavilion.

508
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm sorry to offend you

509
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,040
as you are the leader of the business team.

510
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm sorry.

511
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll leave you to your own business.

512
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,160
I didn't expect that

513
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,400
the Bodhisattva of Yaoluo Pavilion

514
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,920
would be a good lady

515
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
after removing her disguise.

516
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,760
I, the Mobei King,

517
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,720
lost to a lady.

518
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
So you are that Bodhisattva.

519
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,080
Shut up.

520
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,040
Who allowed you to

521
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,160
interfere with my glory?

522
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,360
What's the matter?

523
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,320
So the Bodhisattva of Yaoluo Pavilion

524
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,160
lost to us.

525
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,120
So the Bodhisattva of Douwen

526
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,160
lost to us.

527
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,280
Uncle, you are also a hundred years old.

528
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,440
Why are you so unruly?

529
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,840
It's okay if you are unruly.

530
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
You are still a coward.

531
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,240
Are you ashamed?

532
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,720
Who are you talking about?

533
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,280
I'm talking about you.

534
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,040
You are at least twenty years older than me.

535
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,240
I don't know you.

536
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,640
Our people have found

537
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,520
a lot of purple grass on your carriage.

538
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,920
Tell me about it.

539
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,080
Who are you?

540
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,720
Why did you steal the purple grass?

541
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,440
Please calm down.

542
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,520
We are just businessmen.

543
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,680
We don't know the rules of Mobei.

544
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,240
We just want to buy the purple grass.

545
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,960
That's why we have to do this.

546
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,160
Why do you buy the purple grass?

547
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,280
Of course, it's because

548
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,560
all the tribes of the desert have stopped the trade.

549
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
Interesting.

550
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,240
Go on.

551
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,040
The merchants

552
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
don't care about the danger.

553
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,560
Since Ashile Tribe's three leaders

554
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
and five masters have stopped the trade,

555
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,280
they must have some needs.

556
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,760
Since the desert is under Ashile Tribe's control,

557
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,560
they must not dare to sell the purple grass.

558
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,080
As long as we get it,

559
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,440
we will find the buyer

560
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,280
and sell it at double the price.

561
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,120
It will be worth a million.

562
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,560
But

563
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm very curious about something.

564
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,120
Go ahead.

565
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,440
Since Mobei King has already found us,

566
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,120
why didn't he question us when we won?

567
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,600
Instead, he's waiting for the right moment.

568
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,280
What are you waiting for?

569
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
You're smart.

570
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,360
But you have no chance.

571
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,200
Guards.

572
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920
Take these people

573
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,600
to the prison.

574
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:29,960
Yes.

575
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,360
Wait.

576
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,040
Do it now.

577
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,120
Don't waste my time.

578
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,040
Arrest them.

579
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,440
Go.

580
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,440
Let go.

581
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,200
Wait.

582
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,520
Wait.

583
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,200
You're a bitch.

584
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,720
Brother.

585
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,600
You.

586
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,080
Brother.

587
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,000
Come here.

588
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,360
Did the people from Mo Nan

589
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
leave the city?

590
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,440
They ran away

591
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,720
when they saw their master being arrested.

592
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,320
They reported to us.

593
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,480
That girl is smart.

594
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,800
Alright.

595
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,320
You can leave.

596
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,720
Let me know when the people from Mo Nan come.

597
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,680
Yes.

598
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,760
Guards.

599
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,400
We need to meet Mobei King.

600
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,320
We need to meet your leader.

601
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,080
Hurry up.

602
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,160
Brother Chang.

603
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,360
What should we do?

604
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,280
We've been in Mobei for so long.

605
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,560
Even if we can't sleep,

606
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
we still need to wait for a long time.

607
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Besides, we're still locked up here.

608
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
We don't know when we'll be released.

609
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,080
We need to find a way.

610
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
We can't let them go.

611
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,560
We can't let them go.

612
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
We can't let them go.

613
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
We can't let them go.

614
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
We can't let them go.

615
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,320
What Tao said is right.

616
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,560
Mobei is a bad place.

617
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Why do you say that?

618
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,480
Mobei and Mo Nan were good neighbors before.

619
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,600
But 100 years ago,

620
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,120
Mobei occupied Mo Nan's ancestral land.

621
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,600
Then they fought for a long time because of this.

622
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,920
Then,

623
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,120
Ah Shi Le came.

624
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,640
Although they stopped fighting,

625
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,440
their life was even worse.

626
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,720
Tao didn't allow me to go out and play.

627
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,120
So Mo Nan and Mobei are enemies.

628
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,240
Although Mobei is the leader,

629
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,760
Ah Shi Le controlled him.

630
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,240
From his appearance today,

631
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,760
I feel that he is very guilty about this.

632
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Everyone in the desert is guilty.

633
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,240
No one is willing to be a slave.

634
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,800
No one is willing to be fired.

635
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Even the grass medicine seller has to be obedient.

636
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,880
Someone!

637
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,480
Someone!

638
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,400
Someone!

639
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,520
Why are you shouting?

640
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Someone!

641
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,520
Go to Mobei.

642
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,080
Tell him that I have a deal to talk to him.

643
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,240
Don't go!

644
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,960
You'll regret if you leave!

645
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
Come back!

646
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,480
Don't worry.

647
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,040
My father will come to save us.

648
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,000
He is the bravest man in the world.

649
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
How can I not worry?

650
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,960
The grass medicine will save lives.

651
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,080
Wu Ji, you must hold on.

652
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,440
Wu Ji.

653
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
I want to go out.

654
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,120
Hurry up!

655
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,960
Let us out!

656
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,400
I want to see your faces!

657
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,600
Let us out!

658
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,360
Hurry up!

659
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,320
Someone!

660
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,760
Hurry up!

661
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,640
Let us out!

662
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,320
I want to see your faces!

663
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,760
Thanks to the witness,

664
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,480
there are no patients with heart disease these days.

665
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,280
The patients in the hospital are also stable.

666
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,920
Tegin.

667
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,120
Mu Jin seems to be in a bad condition.

668
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,240
My father cannot take her out of hospital.

669
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Mother,

670
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,600
I've told you not to count me.

671
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,520
Welcome cost.

672
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,000
Kar mechanical chemistry is still up and running.

673
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,560
Get out of the room at once.

674
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,320
My father has been ill for a long time.

675
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,800
Let me have a test.

676
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,520
Okay.

677
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you have any idea?

678
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,360
It depends on fate.

679
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,720
What do you mean?

680
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,880
Her body is cold and hot.

681
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,560
We must reduce her body heat as soon as possible.

682
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,840
I've tried every way

683
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,640
but failed.

684
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,440
I'm afraid

685
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,400
it's hard for her to keep her promise.

686
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,880
Mi Mi.

687
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,240
Mi Mi.

688
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,120
Princess.

689
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,440
Do you think I'm getting old?

690
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,160
You're not old.

691
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
You're just like

692
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,880
when I first met you.

693
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
You're so beautiful.

694
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Only you and Ayi

695
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,040
can tell me the truth

696
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,880
about the whole grassland.

697
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,640
No one can

698
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,120
be more suitable

699
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,280
to serve Ayi.

700
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,120
But

701
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,080
she's Ashile Sun's mother.

702
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,360
She'll die in my hands.

703
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,360
After all, she's served me for so many years.

704
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm a little reluctant.

705
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,000
Fine.

706
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,160
I don't have to pretend anymore.

707
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
How about

708
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I help you choose another female slave?

709
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,040
No need.

710
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,920
Do you have any news to report?

711
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,040
Your Highness.

712
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,040
There's news from the desert.

713
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,560
Ashile Sun didn't go to the desert in person.

714
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,920
He sent the female slave

715
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,720
Mi Mi Guli.

716
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,600
There are also

717
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,920
some people from Central Plains with them.

718
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,520
Female slave?

719
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,440
Central Plains people?

720
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,800
Li Changge?

721
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,080
I think so.

722
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,360
I didn't expect Ashile Sun

723
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,480
to hand over the whole Eagle Division

724
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,200
to Li Changge.

725
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,840
It seems that the relationship is not normal.

726
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Li Changge is not an ordinary woman.

727
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,640
She's my eyes.

728
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,960
Your Highness, don't worry.

729
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,920
Li Changge and others

730
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,920
have been detained by Prince of Mobei.

731
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,520
Because of the forbidden order?

732
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,600
Yes. Mobei is a narrow-minded country.

733
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,920
They dare not disobey.

734
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,960
They're quite smart.

735
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,080
But we can't let it go easily.

736
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,120
Send someone to

737
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,040
remind Mi Mi Guli in secret

738
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,960
so that she won't forget her mission.

739
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,400
Yes, Your Highness.

740
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,200
Besides,

741
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,760
there are ten thousand soldiers

742
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,920
fighting in Mobei and Mo Nan.

743
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,800
Practice hard. Don't be careless.

744
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,760
I understand.

745
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,040
By the way,

746
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,280
didn't you say

747
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,640
you would find me a new female slave?

748
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,560
Bring the wife of Prince of Mobei

749
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,200
and Prince of Mo Nan here.

750
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,960
Yes, Your Highness.

751
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,840
Also,

752
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,800
send a man with a face to show up in Mobei

753
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,840
to show him Li Changge's portrait.

754
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,480
I want to know

755
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
everything about the Eagle Division in Mobei.

756
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,200
Yes.

757
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,560
Commander,

758
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,880
the one from yesterday

759
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,920
is here to see you again.

760
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,720
Which one?

761
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,520
The one who plays the God of War.

762
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,520
They seem to call him...

763
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,920
Changge.

764
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,680
Prince of Mobei can be seen

765
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,720
as he wishes.

766
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,600
You can wait here.

767
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,240
Yes.

768
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
Commander, Prince of Mo Nan is here.

769
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,320
That's fast.

770
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,840
Bring him in.

771
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

772
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,040
You.

773
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,520
Go to the prison

774
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
and bring the one you should bring here.

775
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,200
Yes.

776
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,560
Go.

777
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,840
You must protect the Young Mistress.

778
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,080
You must keep an eye on the rest.

779
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,800
What?

780
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,080
It's late again.

781
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,360
I wonder how the Eagle Division is doing.

782
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,080
Why hasn't anyone come yet?

783
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,520
If we fail,

784
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,200
we'll be in trouble.

785
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,840
How many are there?

786
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,520
I checked.

787
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,240
Six.

788
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
It's possible.

789
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,960
Okay.

790
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,720
Let's prepare

791
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,000
to move back.

792
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,760
Okay.

793
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,680
How is it?

794
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,160
Is your leader willing to see me?

795
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
See you?

796
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
How is that possible?

797
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,680
Our leader wants to see Princess Tu.

798
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,120
What Princess Tu?

799
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,720
There's no Princess Tu here.

800
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,680
Princess Tu.

801
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,760
Princess Tu.

802
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
Don't disturb me.

803
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,160
I told Tan'er I'd get up later.

804
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,240
It's time to get up, Princess Tu.

805
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
You're Princess Tu.

806
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,640
Our leader said

807
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,040
he'd invite Princess Tu.

808
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,720
Who are you?

809
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,800
Tan'er.

810
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,200
It must be Tan'er.

811
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,120
I'm...

812
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,320
Princess, please.

813
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,800
Don't worry.

814
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,960
When I see Tan'er,

815
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
I'll beg him to get you out.

816
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,880
I thought you'd arrive

817
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,920
after noon.

818
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,360
I didn't expect you to arrive so early.

819
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,800
You're really impatient.

820
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
Pu Zi.

821
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,200
I don't want to talk to you.

822
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,840
Where is my daughter?

823
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,960
Yinan,

824
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,280
can't you be more private?

825
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,680
You're so rude.

826
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,120
Your daughter took the guards of Mo Nan

827
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,680
to the Mobei and Huotong.

828
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,040
They're spies who don't know where they're from.

829
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,000
They're eager to steal the grass

830
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,000
and smuggle it out.

831
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,160
They're so cunning.

832
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,200
They're so cunning.

833
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,160
They're eager to steal the grass and smuggle it out.

834
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,240
I've been trying to find them

835
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,440
but I failed to catch up with you.

836
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,640
What are you arguing about?

837
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,880
A spy?

838
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,960
What kind of spy?

839
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,080
I suspected that you were the one who instructed me.

840
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,720
But when I thought about it,

841
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
I think Ashile people

842
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,920
must have been scared of you

843
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,720
for not buying the grass.

844
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,240
You?

845
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,480
You dare not do that?

846
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,520
Pu Zi.

847
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,360
I'm warning you.

848
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,240
If you want to fight, I'll let you go.

849
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,600
Let my daughter go first.

850
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,600
Tu Xia.

851
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,560
Tan.

852
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,520
Tu Zi.

853
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,280
How dare you touch my daughter?

854
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
Mo Nan's soldiers

855
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,720
are not afraid of you stealing the grass.

856
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,840
Yinan.

857
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,840
Between you and me,

858
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,640
do you steal less?

859
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,040
If Ashile people knew

860
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,960
that your daughter stole the grass,

861
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,920
I'm afraid...

862
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
What do you mean?

863
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,800
Recently, Ashile's tent

864
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:43,040
has been fighting for the military

865
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,000
for three days.

866
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,160
Do you know that?

867
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,440
You have a point.

868
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,480
The other day,

869
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,680
the tent brought people to ask for the military.

870
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,960
I promised to give them within ten days.

871
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,200
I heard that

872
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,520
you brought people to ask for your daughter

873
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,840
with a whole cavalry.

874
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,000
Tan.

875
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,880
Okay.

876
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
I promise you.

877
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,360
Let my daughter go.

878
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,680
Let her go.

879
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:08,880
Tu Xia.

880
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,760
Tan.

881
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,840
Tu Xia.

882
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,960
Daughter.

883
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,320
Are you hurt?

884
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,360
Tan.

885
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,120
Did I get into trouble again?

886
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,040
Daughter.

887
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,640
Don't be so willful in the future.

888
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,200
Come on.

889
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,760
Go home with Tan.

890
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,440
Tan.

891
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,240
I have a favor to ask of you.

892
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,720
I know a few friends.

893
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,120
They were arrested too.

894
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,440
Can you save them too?

895
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
What friends?

896
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,720
Tan knows that you are not interested in the grass.

897
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,920
Did they arrest you?

898
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,600
No.

899
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,040
They are good people.

900
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,120
The little princess is really simple.

901
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
You believe whatever others say.

902
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,960
You will be cheated sooner or later.

903
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,040
Tan.

904
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,440
Don't listen to her nonsense.

905
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
If they are just friends,

906
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,760
don't make any trouble.

907
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,560
Tan.

908
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,520
You will know when you see them.

909
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,840
They are not evil.

910
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,000
And Changge said

911
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,720
that they are looking for grass to save people.

912
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,840
Save people?

913
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,920
Yes.

914
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,560
Fuze.

915
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,840
Bring her here.

916
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
One more?

917
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,640
But it needs more horses.

918
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,840
Can you afford it?

919
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,000
It's my business whether I can afford it or not.

920
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,400
I want to see her.

921
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,480
You.

922
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,920
Go and bring that Changge here.

923
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,880
Yes.

924
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,760
Stop.

925
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,080
The spendy emissary arrived

926
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,280
Come out and welcome me.

927
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,520
The sun is rising from the west.

928
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,680
You two are together.

929
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,400
Good.

930
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,040
I won't have to run to Mo Nan

931
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,080
in the sun.

932
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,760
The people of Ashile Tribe.

933
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,480
What's the matter?

934
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,800
Two things.

935
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,040
First,

936
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,520
Great Khan ordered

937
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Mobei and Mo Nan

938
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,040
to fight for the peace

939
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
within ten days.

940
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,240
Where are you going?

941
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,240
To Dingxiang City.

942
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,360
To be the first army.

943
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,480
Great Khan is forcing the troops of each tribe.

944
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,160
Dingxiang.

945
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,640
The second thing.

946
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,760
Each tribe is working for Great Khan.

947
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,240
Thank you for your hard work.

948
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,920
Great Khan's special order is reliable.

949
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,320
Invite all the female troops

950
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,240
to go to the Great Khan's house.

951
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,360
What female troops?

952
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,440
Wives and daughters.

953
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,480
I have no wife and daughters.

954
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,560
I'm afraid I'll have to run for nothing.

955
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,080
I heard your mother is still alive.

956
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,120
They say Mo Nan also has a

957
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,920
lively and cute little princess.

958
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,240
I'm not going.

959
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,640
So the little princess is you.

960
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,680
All right.

961
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,360
I've brought the words.

962
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
The order of the Great Khan is not to resist.

963
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,440
Do it properly.

964
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,080
都記住了嗎

965
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,720
Remember.

966
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Don't alert the police.

967
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,360
Report any situation of Li Changge at any time.

968
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,760
I've never seen this person.

969
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,520
His eyes just now.

970
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
Does he recognize me?

971
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,120
That person just now.

972
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,920
Never let that person go.

973
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,200
Who are you?

974
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,880
Changge.

975
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,800
He is the one you want to see.

976
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,080
I don't want to hide it anymore.

977
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
I'm the military counselor of Eagle Division of Ashile Tribe.

978
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,960
The trusted one of Ashile Division.

979
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Get that person out immediately.

980
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,080
I'll take full responsibility for anything else.

981
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
What responsibility do you have?

982
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,560
You offended the tent.

983
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,800
We can't escape.

984
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,320
You can't escape now either.

985
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Hurry and stop him.

986
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,080
There's no time left.

987
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
I came to Mobei City to find Zicao

988
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,520
because Eagle Division has already been infected with the plague.

989
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,280
But the tent was sealed off.

990
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,000
But all the Zicao channels were sealed off.

991
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,120
What does this mean?

992
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,360
It means the tent has abandoned Eagle Division.

993
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,400
What we have to do now is to form an alliance.

994
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,120
I'm sorry.

995
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm sorry.

996
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,920
I'm sorry.

997
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I'm sorry.

998
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
I'm sorry.

999
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm sorry.

1000
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
I'm sorry.

1001
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
I'm sorry.

1002
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm sorry.

1003
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
I'm sorry.

1004
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
I'm sorry.

1005
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm sorry.

1006
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
I'm sorry.

1007
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
I'm sorry.

1008
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920
I'm sorry.

1009
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
I'm sorry.

1010
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm sorry.

1011
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
I'm sorry.

1012
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm sorry.

1013
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
I'm sorry.

1014
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm sorry.

1015
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
I'm sorry.

1016
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm sorry.

1017
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
I'm sorry.

1018
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm sorry.

1019
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm sorry.

1020
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
I'm sorry.

1021
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
I'm sorry.

1022
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm sorry.

1023
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm sorry.

1024
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
In different worlds

1025
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
In different worlds

1026
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
In different worlds

1027
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
In different worlds

1028
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,560
I'm in the middle of the night

1029
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,400
I'm looking at the stars

1030
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,400
It's become eternity

1031
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,400
The cocoon in the dark

1032
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm sorry.

1033
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,880
I'm sorry.

1034
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
I'm sorry.

1035
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
I'm sorry.

1036
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
I'm sorry.

1037
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,880
I'm sorry.

1038
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm sorry.

1039
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,880
I'm sorry.

1040
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
I'm sorry.

1041
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
I'm sorry.

1042
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880

I'm sorry.

1046
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
I'm sorry.

1047
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
I'm sorry.

1048
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
I'm sorry.

1049
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
I'm sorry.

1050
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
I'm sorry.

1051
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
I'm sorry.

1052
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
I'm sorry.

1053
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
I'm sorry.

1054
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
I'm sorry.

1055
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880

1057
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,880
I'm sorry.

1058
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
I'm sorry.

1059
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm sorry.

1060
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
I'm sorry.
