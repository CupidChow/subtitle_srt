1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will sing a song of hope for him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life, the river of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You met Changge in Luoyang this time?

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't worry. I didn't want to pursue you.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are willing to accept Changge?

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's not that I am unwilling.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's Changge.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is she willing to be shot by father?

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Maybe one day Changge will let go of her feelings.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's not talk about this.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come. Look.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These are all Yan'er's favorite food.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Eat more.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Look at how thin you are.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why aren't you surprised?

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Father, please forgive me.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I just...

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I just saw this beautiful embroidery.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't help but think of a little friend.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
His biggest wish in this life

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is to be able to eat a meal of rice.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But he couldn't make it until he died.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because at that time,

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
only hard and dry cakes were given to him.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have been hungry?

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have been hungry.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You have been hungry.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have also seen many people being hungry.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Every bite of rice outside the palace

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
has to be made by your own hands.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's not easy.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Suddenly, I saw so many delicious dishes on the table.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I suddenly feel a little unaccustomed.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Father,

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
if Leyan didn't have this trip,

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know that the world is so bitter.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's even more bitter and harder than the newspaper.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sometimes, I have been through hardships.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I thought

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that I would suffer

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
according to your original temperament.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I didn't expect you to remember

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that it was all the suffering of others.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Leyan,

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
if you need anything,

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
just tell me.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will make it up to you.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I want the people of the Tang Dynasty

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to have no more panic.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I promise you

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that I will make it up to you.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you, Father.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, okay.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's not talk about it.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come and have your meal.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why are you still using this handkerchief

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
after it's been so old?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If it was in the past,

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I wouldn't have to remind Father.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I would have changed it

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
into a good handkerchief long ago.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's just that I didn't know how to cherish it

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
because I was worried about it.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now I know

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that the wealth of the royal family is all up to the people.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Whether it's a book on the table

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
or a needle on the handkerchief,

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
we all enjoy

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the hard work and expectations of each person.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We can't let it go.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My Leyan

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
has grown up.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Although I haven't seen it with my own eyes,

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but from what you think,

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can think of your journey.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It must be a tough journey.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Father,

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
on this journey,

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I met a lot of nobles.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When I was in Yunzhou,

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Mrs. Chai from the weaving workshop

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
helped me to learn how to survive.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If she hadn't taught me

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
how to survive

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and taken me in,

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come back.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Father,

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I want to ask for a favor from Mrs. Chai.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What favor?

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Father, look.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
These are the fabrics that the weaving workshop's nobles made.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They are not inferior to the palace

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
in terms of memory and patterns.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They are just far away from the ground

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and lack the foundation.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They don't have a chance to make a name for themselves.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, Father,

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
are you willing to help them?

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's really good.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are right.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't expect

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that Yan,

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
who was so shy

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and didn't dare to speak out loud,

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
has now become a talented person.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I even sold fabrics in the market.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They were very good.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Mrs. Chai even praised me.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yan, you have suffered a lot.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I am strong.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mrs. Chai taught me this.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No matter how difficult the world is,

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you can't give up easily.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am able to exchange my warm hands for this.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't feel bitter at all.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I still want to ask for a favor.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Say it.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Father, please allow me to leave the palace

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to examine the farm

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and get close to the people.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sure.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you have to choose a good guard this time.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't lose you again.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Father, don't worry.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I won't lose you again.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I underestimated you before.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Go.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Uncle Lei, I was ordered by Sun Tegin

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to meet the Khan.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's the matter?

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well,

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tegin ordered me to meet the Khan in person.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Please don't make it difficult for me.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Four people should be given the honor of Sun Tegin.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The Khan is not in the tent

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but in Khatun.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Please follow me.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Uncle Lei, please inform the King.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No need.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The Khan is in there.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can go in yourself.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's wrong?

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Nothing.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Eagle Division requests to meet the Khan.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Khan.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Khan.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He is a coward.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is he a genius?

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He knows that Khan has been thinking about him lately.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So he sent someone to contact

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
his father and son.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The scout sent a letter saying that Eagle Division was infected.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So he sent him to ask for medicine.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He wants to die.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Get rid of him.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Wait.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He has something in his arms.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ashile Sun.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He is suspicious of Dingxiang.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How many people are left in Chini in Luoyang?

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Du Ruhui has cleaned up.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Jinse is gone.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Jinse.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What a pity.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It seems that it's not good to remove the nail

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
around Li Shimin.

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you trust me,

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I will lead Chini to burn the place

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and complete your great cause.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Can I continue to trust your loyalty?

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
My life belongs to you.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Please rest assured.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I will not fail you.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't let me down.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yanli is already in a bad situation.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Chini is seriously injured.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Eagle Division will find out sooner or later.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We can't delay it any longer.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What do you mean?

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What do you mean?

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I will be here for half of my life.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Watch the door.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't let anyone who is not related come in.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Khan.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why are you here again?

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I heard that you have a headache again.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So I came to solve your problem.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You are useless.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you have any news about A'Cun?

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Please.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Have you heard about him?

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have asked around for you.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
A'Cun

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
hasn't come to see me for a long time.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It seems that he really

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
doesn't have a father like me.

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Forgive me for being straightforward.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Sun Teqin left the tent

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and went to the river to ride a horse.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm afraid he won't come back.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Shut up.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You don't have the right to judge my son.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Khan.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I have some Chinese medicine

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and made some soup.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You should drink it while it's hot.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It will help you to get better.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Take it away.

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I took good care of you before you got sick.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I took good care of you before you got sick.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Now you are over the moon every day.

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You finally got the old prescription.

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You need to use the blood of your closest family as the medicine.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm willing to try it.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's rare

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that you still have this heart.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Khan.

232
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Please take the medicine.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Khan, take the medicine.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Lie down and rest.

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Lei Meng.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Your Highness.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go and reply to Eagle Division.

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Tell them that Yaro despised the royal court

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and had no Khan.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He was imprisoned and was being filial.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Your Highness.

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why don't we

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
send Yaro's head

246
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
to Ashile Sun

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and completely wipe out his reputation?

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Ashile Sun

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
is the reason why Eagle Division is completely subdued.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Except for his past memories and courage,

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the most important thing is his friendship with his subordinates.

253
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's why he is so kind.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yaro's death

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
can't be known to Ashile Sun yet.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Otherwise,

257
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
he will rush to the tent.

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
By then, our plan

259
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
will be in vain.

260
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I still need some time

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
to complete my big plan.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Is Ashile Sun that scary?

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't believe

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
that the whole Ashile Tribe can't destroy Eagle Division.

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll do it.

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
When will you teach me?

267
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What did I do

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
for half of my life?

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
For the sake of Khan.

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If it wasn't for the sake of making Sher

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the king of the grasslands,

272
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I wouldn't be here.

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ashile Sun

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is the biggest obstacle

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
for Sher to become Khan.

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I never want him to die.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I never wait for the chance.

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I never wait for the chance.

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I know

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the weight of his heart.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What does he mean?

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why should he fight with my son?

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I understand.

285
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If Khan knows

286
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
the effort you put in for him,

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
he will be moved.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't need him to understand me.

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I just want my son

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to become a king

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
smoothly and powerfully.

292
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He won't suffer anymore.

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Khatun.

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
General Lei is here.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm here to report to Khan.

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Khatun.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Khan's headache is getting worse.

298
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Even the doctor in the ward can't help it.

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you have any solution?

300
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I used the Chinese medicine

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to make Khan some soup.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He just drank it.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He's asleep.

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't disturb him.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Great. Great.

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Thank you, Khatun.

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't worry.

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm here.

309
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No one can disturb him.

310
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Halt.

311
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Halt.

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's a barrier

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
to stay in the Heart of Stone Bureau.

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I understand.

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Besides,

316
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
henceforth

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
all soldiers guarding the war

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
will be our men.

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

320
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,880
Be careful!

321
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
I didn't expect that Father sent you here.

322
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you doing there?

323
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,680
Hao Du.

324
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
Why are you standing so far away?

325
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm afraid that Her Highness doesn't want to see me.

326
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
Then why are you still here?

327
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,960
It's hard to keep your life.

328
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,800
If I'm not happy, you'll be too late.

329
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,400
Hao Du.

330
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,800
When did you become so obedient?

331
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm not a good person.

332
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I'm just a child.

333
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
When did you become so obedient?

334
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,200
Hao Du, I told you to stop.

335
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
I'm afraid that you'll be angry.

336
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,080
But I don't know what to do.

337
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm not doing anything right.

338
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,160
You're not happy about anything.

339
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
I can only watch you from afar.

340
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
As long as you're safe,

341
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,080
I have nothing to worry about.

342
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,680
Wait.

343
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
I have something to tell you.

344
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,840
I'm afraid that you'll be too late.

345
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm afraid that you'll be too late.

346
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,520
What are you doing?

347
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,840
You're seeking the exorcist effect.

348
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,520
What about me?

349
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,000
What did you mean?

350
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,360
Then okay.

351
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,880
Turn around.

352
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,800
I won't eat you.

353
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,120
In the Fallow囉 Goddess Pass,

354
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,840
did you let Changge go on purpose?

355
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,800
I don't know.

356
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,120
Do you know

357
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,440
I'm the one who hurt Tang.

358
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,280
I'm the one who hurt Tang.

359
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I'm the one who caused the chaos.

360
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
Thank you.

361
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,840
Protecting Tang is my duty.

362
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,040
You don't have to act.

363
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,400
Alright.

364
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,760
I know the answer.

365
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,200
Then,

366
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,800
do I have to keep a distance from you?

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,280
Of course.

368
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm a daughter of a rich man.

369
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
You have to protect me.

370
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,840
Yes.

371
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,480
Cao Qian.

372
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Any news about Yaro?

373
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,800
Not Yaro.

374
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,840
It's Uncle Lei.

375
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
Dream on!

376
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,600
What are you doing here?

377
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,520
You were the one who wanted to leave the tent.

378
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,720
And now, you still have to

379
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
ask Y rely for some stuff?

380
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,000
Great Khan has ordered

381
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,040
to no longer hate any day

382
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,960
who rating against Shifu.

383
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,600
Your squad is still

384
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,040
arrogant at the end.

385
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Ashile Sun.

386
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,520
You've got

387
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
to this Great Khan.

388
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,840
Where is Yaro?

389
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,040
He's been imprisoned.

390
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,720
The Great Khan is already

391
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,240
the last person he can be kind to

392
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,120
before he's killed.

393
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,440
Besides,

394
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,520
the toothed tent is in a hurry.

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
I suggest you give up on it

396
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,040
and commit suicide.

397
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,240
Dexian,

398
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,240
let me lead the troops into the toothed tent

399
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,320
and save Yaro.

400
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,360
Yaro is our brother.

401
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,240
You know about the toothed tent.

402
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,080
If we go in,

403
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,560
we'll only make people suffer.

404
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,800
Besides, Yaro's body

405
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
can't stand me.

406
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
I'm afraid he'll die in half a day.

407
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,440
No.

408
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,560
If we go into the toothed tent now,

409
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,960
we'll be punished by them.

410
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,280
Then the Eagle Division

411
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,560
will be in a more dangerous position.

412
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,960
Then,

413
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,240
Yaro's life will be in danger?

414
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,200
Su Yishe,

415
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,240
Changge is right.

416
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,200
If we go into the toothed tent now

417
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,120
and save them,

418
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,240
what about the other brothers?

419
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,480
It's impossible for us to commit suicide.

420
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
If we go into the toothed tent now,

421
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
the Eagle Division will be

422
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,640
in a more dangerous position.

423
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,760
I won't give up on Yaro.

424
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,240
But now,

425
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,640
we'll only make him suffer.

426
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,920
What should we do now?

427
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
We should find the grass

428
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,640
and get rid of the plague.

429
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,920
Are you out of your minds?

430
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,360
I don't care about the toothed tent.

431
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,360
I don't care about

432
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,200
the conflict between you and Ashile.

433
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,200
The time now

434
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,640
is the most important.

435
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,440
The time is getting shorter.

436
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,600
Nothing is more important

437
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
than finding the grass that can save us.

438
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,040
He's right.

439
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,440
The most important thing now

440
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
is to find the grass.

441
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,320
Let's put aside other things first.

442
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Everything

443
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,840
needs to be done in a light and serious way.

444
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,920
Okay.

445
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,160
Let's focus on finding the grass first.

446
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,640
As for Yaro,

447
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,240
I believe Father will forgive him

448
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,360
for the sake of our relationship.

449
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,120
Yes.

450
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,200
Everything will be done according to the special measures.

451
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,840
Okay.

452
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Come with me.

453
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,680
Bring some herbs to Mu Jin.

454
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,200
The grass is in Mobei.

455
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,280
I'll take the brothers of Yanxing Sect

456
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,000
to go there overnight.

457
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,600
We'll arrive there within three days.

458
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,000
Mobei is a desolate place.

459
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,480
I've never been there.

460
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,880
How will you go there?

461
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,040
Master Qin will take Yanxing Sect to go to all directions.

462
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,480
He should be experienced.

463
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
I'll ask him to give the original mother

464
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,560
to Situ Langlang.

465
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
Yanxing Sect will go with me.

466
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,040
But...

467
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,480
You don't believe me?

468
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,400
Mu Jin has fallen.

469
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,360
I can't let anything happen to you.

470
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,000
I asked for it.

471
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,800
Ying's Group is also my home.

472
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm willing to take the risk for you.

473
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,640
And now,

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,240
we have no other choice.

475
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Changge.

476
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,440
Mimi.

477
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,280
Aren't you taking care of Mu Jin?

478
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,160
Why are you out?

479
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
I told you.

480
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm from Mobei.

481
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,920
You heard it.

482
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Take me there.

483
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,440
I grew up in Mobei when I was a kid.

484
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,840
I know the way to Mobei

485
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,800
and I know the purple grass.

486
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,480
I'm more likely to find the purple grass than you.

487
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,080
And if I find it as soon as possible,

488
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Mu Jin and everyone

489
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,040
will not die.

490
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,920
Tegin.

491
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,760
Ying's Group's disaster

492
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
started because of me.

493
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,080
I'm begging you

494
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
to give me a chance to atone for my sins.

495
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,720
Sun.

496
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,960
Let Mimi follow me.

497
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,760
Okay.

498
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,000
Hao Du.

499
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,360
Thank you for walking with me all day.

500
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
It's my duty.

501
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,920
Take care.

502
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,320
Eat slowly.

503
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,760
Hao Du.

504
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm here.

505
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,200
Forget it.

506
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,280
It's okay.

507
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,360
His Majesty asked me to follow you.

508
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,560
What's the matter?

509
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,160
You can tell me.

510
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,240
If you've liked someone for a long time

511
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
and you know that

512
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,200
he should have had someone in his heart,

513
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,400
do you still have to ask him in person?

514
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
I think I'll ask him in person.

515
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,400
But...

516
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,640
It doesn't matter if he rejects you.

517
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm here to help you.

518
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,720
I'm here to help you.

519
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,560
I know my heart.

520
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,360
If I don't ask him in person,

521
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,480
I can't give up easily.

522
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,320
You're right.

523
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,440
If I don't ask him in person,

524
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,560
it's like I've failed my own wish.

525
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,720
Your Highness.

526
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,400
But...

527
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
I thought I've become

528
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,600
much braver now.

529
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,760
But when I think of telling him in person,

530
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't even have the courage to ask him out.

531
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
Let alone...

532
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,800
Hao Du.

533
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,480
What did you want to say?

534
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,320
Nothing.

535
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Let's go back, Your Highness.

536
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,520
Drink some water.

537
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,720
Okay.

538
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,920
Okay.

539
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,640
Mother.

540
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,480
I might have to leave here.

541
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,080
Promise me.

542
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
You'll hold on.

543
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
I promise you.

544
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,160
I'll bring back the purple grass.

545
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,720
So...

546
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,720
So...

547
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,200
You must hold on.

548
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
You'll be in trouble when I come back.

549
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,640
You must hold on.

550
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,800
Otherwise...

551
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,160
Master Qi.

552
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,760
Master Xiao.

553
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,720
I've already sent the message

554
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,200
that we're going to Mobei to Xu Feng and Shi Ba.

555
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,720
They're waiting for us

556
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,840
to meet up with us.

557
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,280
As for Yuanniang,

558
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,080
Asun, Situ,

559
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,560
and the brothers of Yan Xingmen

560
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,320
will take care of her.

561
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't worry, Master Xiao.

562
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Okay.

563
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
Then we'll go back.

564
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,360
Okay.

565
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,880
Okay.

566
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay.

567
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,920
Okay.

568
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,440
Okay.

569
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,040
Okay.

570
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,560
Okay.

571
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,120
Okay.

572
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,640
Okay.

573
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,200
Okay.

574
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Okay.

575
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,320
Okay.

576
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,960
Okay.

577
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,480
Okay.

578
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,120
Okay.

579
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,640
Okay.

580
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,880
Let's go.

581
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,480
Go.

582
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Brother Shuyu.

583
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
Why are you here?

584
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,520
Hao Du told me

585
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,200
that you've been working hard

586
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,680
to find out about the people of Nongsan.

587
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
If there's anything I can help,

588
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,720
I'll do my best.

589
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,760
Okay.

590
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,680
Let's go together today.

591
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,280
Let's go.

592
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,600
I wonder when the rain will stop.

593
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,360
Don't be afraid.

594
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm not afraid.

595
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,960
With you,

596
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,280
the sky will be clear.

597
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Don't run around.

598
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,680
Brother Shuyu.

599
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,840
Thank you for staying with me all day.

600
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,280
Leyan.

601
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,840
I think you've changed.

602
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,520
Brother Shuyu, tell me.

603
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
How have I changed?

604
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,760
I can't tell you.

605
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,880
You seem to be braver.

606
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,000
Actually, I'm not brave at all.

607
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,000
But today,

608
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,920
I want to be brave once.

609
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,880
Go for it.

610
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,960
Xiyue.

611
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,400
When I went toentre the Channelhus in不被所许,

612
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,320
there was a little devil

613
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,720
íamos a.....

614
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Since the day I met you in Luoyang,

615
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,880
I've been wanting to ask you a question.

616
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,000
But I don't know how to start.

617
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,320
It's okay.

618
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,080
Go ahead.

619
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,840
Does Brother Shuyu still like Changge?

620
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Changge and I

621
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,720
have separated for a long time.

622
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,400
We're no longer in the same path.

623
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,440
When he left Chang'an,

624
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,760
I should have known.

625
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,000
I like you.

626
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
I like you.

627
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,160
I like you.

628
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
Brother Shuyu,

629
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,320
are you willing to let me be your companion?

630
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,360
You didn't reject me.

631
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,160
No, I...

632
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,360
I...

633
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,120
I...

634
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,720
I...

635
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,120
I...

636
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,880
I...

637
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,720
I...

638
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,520
I...

639
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,320
I...

640
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,120
I...

641
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,720
I...

642
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,520
I...

643
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,320
I...

644
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,120
I...

645
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,920
I...

646
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,720
I...

647
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,520
I...

648
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,320
I...

649
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,120
I...

650
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,920
I...

651
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,720
I...

652
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,520
I...

653
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,320
I...

654
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,120
I...

655
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,120
I...

656
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,120
I...

657
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,120
I...

658
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,120
I...

659
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,120
I...

660
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,920
I...

661
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,720
I...

662
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,520
I...

663
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,320
I...

664
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,120
I...

665
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,920
I...

666
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,120
Master.

667
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,720
You're not sleeping at night?

668
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,720
Yes.

669
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,720
What are you thinking about?

670
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
I'm calculating the schedule.

671
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Changge...

672
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,120
Changge and the others should be in Mobei by tomorrow.

673
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,120
Bad news.

674
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,720
I'm afraid you have some illness.

675
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,920
What illness?

676
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,520
Of course,

677
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,520
Xiang Si disease.

678
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,920
It's fun.

679
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,120
Changge,

680
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,520
your idea is good.

681
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,120
We enter the city separately.

682
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,720
It's not easy to be found by guards.

683
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,120
I thought

684
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
there were so many people

685
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,320
and most of them were in the central plain.

686
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,920
I was afraid they would be stopped by guards.

687
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
It must be more strict to enter the city gate.

688
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
As long as we enter the city gate,

689
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,120
there will be no big problem.

690
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,320
Besides, we are moving separately now.

691
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
The situation will be faster.

692
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
It's fun.

693
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,920
Changge.

694
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Here, hold it.

695
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,320
Ruomin,

696
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,920
is Mobei always so lively?

697
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,520
Why is it like the New Year?

698
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
It's the festival of cold and cold.

699
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,120
People in Mobei will use grass to dispel cold and cold,

700
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
to cure illness and to cure evil.

701
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
So now,

702
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,320
there must be grass in Mobei's medicine shop.

703
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,520
Hurry up.

704
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,520
Hurry up.

705
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,920
What's wrong with him?

706
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,720
Get lost.

707
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,320
Go.

708
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,920
Take care.

709
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,520
Hurry up.

710
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,320
Hurry up.

711
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,520
Don't go.

712
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,520
Come here.

713
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,520
Come here.

714
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,320
Hurry up.

715
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,520
My lady.

716
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
What are you doing?

717
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,920
Mr. Tang.

718
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,720
Let him go.

719
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,520
What are you looking at?

720
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,320
Go.

721
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Mr. Tang.

722
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,120
Go.

723
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Why is it so cold now?

724
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,520
Besides, it's Ashile Tribe's people.

725
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,120
Hurry up.

726
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,320
Go.

727
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,120
Go.

728
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,520
Ruomin,

729
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
you haven't come back for ten years.

730
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,920
Is this city

731
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,720
the same as you remember?

732
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
When I left,

733
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,320
there weren't so many people here.

734
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,520
I didn't expect it to be so bustling now.

735
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,520
What's this?

736
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
I heard that Mobei's leader

737
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,720
is a very talented person.

738
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,320
In less than ten years,

739
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
he turned Mobei into a desert business.

740
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,920
Today,

741
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
it's really not a bad thing.

742
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
With such a leader,

743
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Mobei won't be bullied again, right?

744
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,720
I hope so.

745
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Take a look.

746
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Let's go get the medicine.

747
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,920
Come on.

748
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,520
Everyone, take a look.

749
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,720
Come on, everyone.

750
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,520
Take a look.

751
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,720
Empty cup.

752
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,520
Excuse me.

753
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,520
Take a look.

754
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,320
Empty.

755
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Three, two, one.

756
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
Good.

757
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,120
What a beautiful handkerchief.

758
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
If you like it,

759
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,920
I'll give it to you.

760
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,120
Give it to me?

761
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
Then you won't have it.

762
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,920
Simple.

763
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,920
Good.

764
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,920
Good.

765
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
You're amazing.

766
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,920
Come on.

767
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,920
Thank you, everyone.

768
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,720
Thank you.

769
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,320
Thank you.

770
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,120
Good.

771
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,120
Come on.

772
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,320
Mr. Qi.

773
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,120
How are you?

774
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,320
I asked around.

775
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
It's said that Mobei's king's court

776
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,720
suddenly banned the grass trade a few days ago.

777
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,320
All the medicine shops don't have grass.

778
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,520
It seems that we want to get

779
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,120
the grass we need at once.

780
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,320
But we can't get the grass.

781
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,360
If we

782
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,120
go to collect the grass,

783
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,120
it will be too difficult.

784
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,320
And it's easy to alert the snake.

785
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,920
If it alerted the Mobei king,

786
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
it would be bad.

787
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,720
It's a trap.

788
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,720
The change

789
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,320
is not from nothing.

790
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,120
Toothpick.

791
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,320
It's the toothpick.

792
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,720
Mr. Qi.

793
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Is there any other way?

794
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
I think

795
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,920
there will be a place

796
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,720
where we can get the grass

797
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,320
no matter how clean it is.

798
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:49,720
No matter how clean it is.

799
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,320
As long as we are willing to pay a high price,

800
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,320
someone will risk his life.

801
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,320
Mr. Qi.

802
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,720
Go and ask around.

803
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,720
I will agree to

804
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,320
whatever conditions the other party wants.

805
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:58,920
Okay.

806
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,320
I'll go now.

807
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,520
Wait.

808
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,120
Mr. Qi.

809
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
I have one more request.

810
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,920
I just saw the Ashile Tribe

811
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,920
fighting the army of the desert.

812
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Maybe we should

813
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,920
ask the chief to

814
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,120
tell us about it.

815
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,120
Don't worry, Young Master.

816
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
I will go there to get some fresh air.

817
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,120
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

818
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,120
You guys,

819
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,920
follow me.

820
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,720
Yes.

821
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,520
Changge.

822
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,720
Don't worry.

823
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,920
There are people from Mr. Qin and the Yanxin Sect.

824
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,720
It's not hard to get some information.

825
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,920
Let's go and take a rest nearby.

826
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,320
Let's go.

827
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,720
Thank you.

828
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,120
Young Master.

829
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
How can you let 18 go to find Luo Xiaodi alone?

830
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Isn't it appropriate for me to go?

831
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,920
18 is a low profile.

832
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,120
Do you think I'm too open-minded?

833
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,120
You said that yourself?

834
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,720
Hello, shopkeeper.

835
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,120
Give me a few more cakes.

836
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,320
Wrap them up and take them away.

837
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,320
Keep them.

838
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,720
There are more.

839
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,720
You still don't have enough?

840
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,320
Give a few more cakes.

841
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:05,920
I don't know.

842
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,920
Didn't 18 just say

843
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,920
he wants to buy some cakes?

844
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,720
I don't know how much 18 ate just now.

845
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,520
Give him some,

846
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,520
in case he gets hungry.

847
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,720
Ye Zhao.

848
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,520
Coming.

849
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,120
Young lady.

850
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,920
You ate so much.

851
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,720
Are you going to give up your money?

852
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,320
How is that possible?

853
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,520
But I was in a hurry.

854
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,520
I didn't bring enough money.

855
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,320
How about this?

856
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
I'll leave you a note.

857
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,120
I'll pay you back in a few days.

858
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,120
What do you think?

859
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,320
Young lady.

860
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Are you kidding me?

861
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,320
The shop is a small business.

862
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,520
If you don't want to pay,

863
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,520
I think you should settle the bill.

864
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,320
I'm just a little late.

865
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,720
I won't be a bad person.

866
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,120
I can give you twice as much money.

867
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,120
Three times is fine.

868
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,320
Young lady.

869
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,120
If you don't settle the bill,

870
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,520
don't blame me for taking you to see our leader.

871
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,720
Do you really think I don't have enough money for you?

872
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,520
This is the embroidery of the royal family of the Central Plains.

873
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,120
The silk and embroidery are all top-quality.

874
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Just this one piece

875
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
is worth at least five pearls.

876
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,520
Five?

877
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,720
I'll use it to pay you back.

878
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,520
What do you think?

879
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,520
Is this really

880
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,720
the item of the royal family of the Central Plains?

881
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,920
I'm just kidding.

882
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,720
If I didn't have enough money for you,

883
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,720
I wouldn't have let you go.

884
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,920
I'm not done yet.

885
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,120
I haven't asked you to pay me back.

886
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,320
No.

887
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,520
I have to find someone who knows the business.

888
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Sorry to disturb you.

889
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,320
Are you from the Central Plains?

890
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,920
Miss Fan,

891
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,520
please help me check this handkerchief.

892
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Your response is gradually changing.

893
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,120
Your happiness is gradually changing.

894
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,320
I'm slowly getting addicted to you.

895
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,920
Before we say goodbye,

896
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,120
let's meet.

897
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,320
I'll remember your figure

898
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,120
and lock it into my tender dream.

899
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,320
Before dawn,

900
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:37,320
my longing flows through my fingers.

901
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,720
There's always a moment

902
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,320
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

903
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,120
There's always a longing

904
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,120
that's between you and me.

905
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,720
We've met before.

906
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
We're in different worlds.

907
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
We're in different worlds.

908
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,720
I miss you so much.

909
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,520
The night is getting darker.

910
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,520
The night is getting darker.

911
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,720
The night is getting darker.

912
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,720
There's always a moment

913
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,520
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

914
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,320
There's always a longing

915
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,320
that's between you and me.

916
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,720
We've met before.

917
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,120
We're in different worlds.

918
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,520
We're in different worlds.

919
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,120
I miss you so much.

920
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,920
The night is getting darker.

921
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,920
The night is getting darker.

922
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,520
There's always a moment

923
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,520
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

924
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,120
We've met before.
