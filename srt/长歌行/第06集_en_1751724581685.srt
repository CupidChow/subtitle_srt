1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
The heart is boiling

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
To the distance

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
The past is bitter

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,960
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Follow the light

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Forget you

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,960
This is the look of my stubbornness

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,960
To forget the long yearning in the past

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Climb the river of life and do not forget the crazy

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,960
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Sirs, your dishes

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Enjoy your meal

15
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
I'll pour it for you

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Enjoy your meal

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
What would you like to eat?

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Give me a plate of mutton

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Okay

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Sirs, thank you

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
You're quite sensible

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Where are you from?

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
To be honest

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
I have a cousin

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
He is Niu Awu

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
He is a military officer in Youzhou

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
I wonder if you know him

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Have you heard of this?

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
There are some brothers in the camp

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
But I don't know if they are military officers

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
You're so filial

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
I advise you

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
You're a soldier

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
You don't have to be a soldier

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
You should find a side

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
What do you mean?

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
You haven't seen the world

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,960
It won't be long before you can be a military officer

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
You can't keep your head

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Watch your words

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Don't talk nonsense when you're drunk

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
If someone hears you

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Be careful of your head

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Thank you for your help

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
But Youzhou is a big city

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,960
It's not worth it to be so close

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
After the Fourth Inner Council

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
The governor closed the door

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
The generals from other places

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
All rushed to the cousin and went to the capital to work

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
But we don't give face to anyone

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,960
We haven't been closed for seven days

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
If the crown prince blames us

54
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
We won't be able to get out

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Then Lord Lujiang will be sad

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
He will drag the whole army of Youzhou into trouble

57
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Our general is still in love with Lord Lujiang

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
He can't help but be sad

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
He will kill us

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Let's drink

61
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
I don't have any reason

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm just a friend

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm a kind and courageous person

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
That's good

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Thank you for your guidance

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Enjoy your meal

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm leaving

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Let's eat

69
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I've been patient with you

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
For this match

71
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I've been patient with you

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
But you've been so polite to me

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Why bother?

74
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I'm from the Shandong family

75
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
I have no idea about the future

76
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm a martial artist

77
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
How can I be as good as you?

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
I don't want to be your enemy

79
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't need to be so formal

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
These are gifts from the court

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Don't get lost on the road

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Let's go

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Yes

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Brother Shuyu

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Let's go

86
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Where did you get the iron ore?

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
My lord

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
We made a mistake in the north

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
We got the iron ore by accident

90
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,960
My lord said it's for the iron store

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
He said it's a good price

92
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
If you do this

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
I will be dead

94
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
My lord

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Such a high-quality iron ore

96
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
It's also a common farm

97
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Isn't it a waste of money?

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Brother

99
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Can you get these iron ore?

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
It's a serious crime to steal iron ore

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Take it down and chop it

103
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
No, no, no

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
There are

105
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
There are

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
My lord

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
How much do you want?

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I want as much as you want

109
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Then

110
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I have to go back and talk to my master

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Brother

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Brother

113
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Remember

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I want two thousand

115
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
After the goods are ready

116
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Tell someone to inform me

117
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
There are many people outside the city

118
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,960
We will pay the money and the goods

119
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Ok

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Don't play tricks with me

121
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Otherwise, you and you guys

122
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
None of you can live

123
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
My lord

124
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
My lord

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Don't worry

126
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Don't worry

127
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Don't worry

128
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Go

129
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Go

130
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Go

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Send a team of archers to the city

132
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
And ambush near the grass

133
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
I will tell them to

134
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
No one can escape

135
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Yes

136
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Go

137
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Why are you here?

138
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
You can't leave me alone

139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I came all the way here

140
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
You think too much

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Why didn't you say

142
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
You are going to talk business in Youzhou?

143
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
You didn't ask

144
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
What are you doing here?

145
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
I have some private affairs

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Come to the City Hall to handle private affairs

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
It seems that the Fourteenth Wolf is really rich

148
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
What nonsense

149
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I'm out on the road

150
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Can't I go out for a walk?

151
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm going back to the inn now

152
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
What a coincidence

153
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm going back to the inn too

154
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Let's go for a walk

155
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Flower umbrella

156
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Flower umbrella

157
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Flower umbrella

158
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Arun, take care

159
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
See you

160
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Please

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Please

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
It seems that the Fourteenth Wolf and I

163
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
are fated to be rich

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
I have to go for a walk

165
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
What a coincidence

166
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Come on, fan

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Take a look

168
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
The Fourteenth Wolf lives here

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Ah, it's allowed to live here

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
The Fourteenth Wolf doesn't know how to go back to the room?

171
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
You go first

172
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
You don't think

173
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
We will still live in the same room, right?

174
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I'm going to the inn

175
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm going to the inn

176
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm going to the inn

177
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I'm going to the inn

178
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm going to the inn

179
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm going to the inn

180
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Tegin is back

181
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Tegin

182
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Tegin, why are you so happy?

183
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Really?

184
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Yes

185
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Tegin is a rare person

186
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
How is it going?

187
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Tegin, it's okay if you don't mention him

188
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
You can just go around his stomach

189
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Tegin

190
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
If it wasn't for your bad luck

191
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I would have hit the king

192
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Guess what?

193
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
He wants our two thousand iron ore

194
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
What a big appetite

195
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Two thousand iron ore

196
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
We can't get it

197
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
What should we do, Tegin?

198
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
No

199
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
No?

200
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Tegin

201
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I don't understand what you mean

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Tonight

203
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
We will meet General Peng

204
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
We really go?

205
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Yes

206
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Master

207
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
You come back so soon

208
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
The inn agreed?

209
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I failed this time

210
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
But I did get some benefits

211
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
A'Dou

212
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Go find some paper

213
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I have to write a good day

214
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Okay

215
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I hope I get it right this time

216
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I will

217
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Leyan

218
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Brother Shuyu

219
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Princess

220
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Why are you hiding in the carriage?

221
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Come down

222
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Come on

223
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Why are you here?

224
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Brother Shuyu

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Actually I

226
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I am worried about you

227
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
So I came here

228
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
I am afraid

229
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
You are not a good person

230
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
I am afraid

231
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I am worried about you

232
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
So I followed you secretly

233
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
What should I worry about?

234
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Don't make trouble next time

235
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
I will arrange a man

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
To send you back to Luoyang

237
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
No

238
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
I don't want to go back alone

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Guards

240
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Please get on the horse

241
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Brother Shuyu

242
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Brother Hao

243
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Why are you so anxious

244
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
To send you away?

245
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I am worried about your safety

246
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Brother Shuyu

247
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I don't believe him

248
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Why don't you send me back?

249
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
But I have work to do

250
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Why don't I follow you?

251
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I won't make trouble

252
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Brother Hao

253
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Youzhou is urgent

254
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
We can't be late

255
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
It's okay if you go back late

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
What if something happens to you

257
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
And you are in danger

258
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
You can take the responsibility

259
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Princess is in danger

260
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
There are people who are worried about her

261
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I will take the responsibility

262
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Leyan

263
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
I will go with you and my accomplice

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I will give you a ride

265
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
When we arrive at the next station

266
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Brother Shuyu

267
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
I heard from this bad guy

268
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Not only kill Changge

269
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
But also you

270
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Pack up

271
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Get ready to leave

272
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Yes

273
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Don't worry

274
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I know

275
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Brother Shuyu

276
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I will go with you

277
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Go

278
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960

302

Go

303
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
General Wang

304
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Sorry to keep you waiting

305
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Yes

306
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
You are the master of those businessmen

307
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
How long have you been in business

308
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Several years

309
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
General

310
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
The car is empty

311
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
You dare to play me

312
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Wang Junkuo

313
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Haven't seen you for years

314
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
You really don't even recognize me

315
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
You are

316
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
You are the English teacher of Ashile Tribe

317
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Ashile Sun

318
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
You have the guts

319
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Dare to come to Youzhou to come to the Net

320
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
If I remember correctly

321
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
But General Wang took the initiative

322
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
I already knew there was a trick

323
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
But compared with what I want

324
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Send your head to Chang'an

325
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
That is more valuable

326
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
You go to Chang'an now

327
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm afraid I have no way to go back

328
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I will send you to live

329
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
But someone doesn't want to

330
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Master

331
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Your handwriting is so beautiful

332
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Master

333
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
What are you writing

334
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
The way to live

335
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
The way to live

336
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Martial arts secret book

337
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
You can understand it

338
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
It depends on whether Li Yuan dares to eat

339
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I'm sorry

340
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Master

341
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
What is this

342
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Crown prince's blood

343
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Crown prince's blood

344
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
What are you talking about

345
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Master

346
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
You are

347
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
From now on

348
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I'm not afraid of anything

349
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Sit down

350
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
What

351
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Afraid

352
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
What are you talking about

353
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
The king of Qin has entered the Eastern Palace

354
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Youzhou is in danger

355
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
How to act, I'm sure you know better than me

356
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
I'm afraid

357
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm afraid

358
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm afraid

359
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
How to act, I'm sure you know better than me

360
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Instead of sitting and waiting for the king

361
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I advise you

362
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Use the power of the land of Youzhou

363
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Find your own way

364
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I am loyal to the court

365
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
How can you make a big decision here

366
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
You say you are loyal to the court

367
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Then why are you searching for iron stones in the back

368
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Just to steal weapons

369
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
To be prepared to start a war

370
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Are you going to tell me

371
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
You are going to attack the new crown prince

372
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
General Wang feels ungrateful

373
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Just because the price is not enough

374
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
If Khan wants to help your city

375
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Lack of iron stones

376
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
What is it

377
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
What do you mean

378
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Go

379
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
West Wing Battle Horse

380
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Don't be anxious

381
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
If this business general wants to talk

382
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Whether it's a war horse or a weapon

383
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Ashile Tribe

384
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Will provide Youzhou with everything

385
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
What's the benefit of helping you

386
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
You will not be unworthy of the strength of the king of Qin

387
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Although Youzhou is a heavy battle

388
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
But if you want to start an army

389
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Even if you can win for a while

390
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
But how long can you hold on

391
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
It's better to go back to Ashile Tribe

392
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
We support

393
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Don't say that you are against the king of Qin

394
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Even if it is a dog for a dog

395
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
It's not impossible

396
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Want me to listen to Yan Li, that bastard

397
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
You don't think

398
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
In that case

399
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Goodbye

400
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Go

401
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
General

402
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Do you want to shoot

403
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Send someone to follow

404
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Mo Qing's location

405
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Yes

406
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Go back and tell your general

407
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
My Tegin doesn't like this

408
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
If you follow me again

409
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Head down

410
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
If you think it over

411
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Send a white gold out of the grass

412
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Someone will contact you then

413
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Who is coming

414
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I am Sun Tegin

415
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Warrior of the Underworld, Su Yishe

416
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
An urgent military report to the Great Khan

417
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
It's Eagle Division

418
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
I am the leader of the Tegin

419
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I am the leader of the Tegin

420
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Great Khan

421
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
It's Eagle Division, don't worry

422
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Little Khan

423
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
What are you doing

424
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Stop

425
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
This is the military report I promised to the Great Khan

426
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
You can't see

427
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Give it back to me

428
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Why are you alone

429
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Where is Sun

430
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Didn't you die in the Central Plains before I did it

431
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
You think too much

432
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Sun Tegin is fine

433
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Let me go, I want to see Khan

434
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
What's the hurry

435
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Khan is busy

436
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
I'll see for him first

437
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
No wonder you can't see the news of this kid

438
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
It turned out to be going to Youzhou

439
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
I will hand it over to the Great Khan

440
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Get back to Eagle Division

441
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Mom

442
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Mom

443
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Are you okay in the sky

444
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Changge seems

445
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Tomorrow Changge is going to do something big

446
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
It's not yet known that the city has failed

447
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
But Changge has no other choice

448
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Even Wei's family has turned over to Li's family

449
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Changge has no one to rely on

450
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
No one is willing to take the risk

451
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
The crown prince's wedding is Ayi's

452
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I hope Changge can use this opportunity to unite with Ayi

453
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
To avenge the great achievement of the Eastern Palace

454
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
But if mom is still here

455
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
I must be blamed for being impulsive

456
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Don't worry

457
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Changge will take good care of the crown prince's heart

458
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
I won't let him fall into the hands of the evil

459
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Your back is so tired

460
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
What's the matter?

461
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Something on your mind?

462
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Nothing

463
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
It's just a small thing

464
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Really?

465
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
I'm not going to be able to sleep

466
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm going to sleep

467
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
I'm going to sleep

468
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
I'm going to sleep

469
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
I'm going to sleep

470
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm going to sleep

471
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm going to sleep

472
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
I'm going to sleep

473
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
You're not going to sleep?

474
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
I thought you were hurt because you couldn't go into the Governor's Mansion today

475
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
A'Zhun, you're joking

476
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm just passing by

477
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
A nobody like me

478
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
How dare I tell the Governor's Mansion

479
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
A nobody

480
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I remember when we first met

481
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
You were the wind of the Yiqi of the Napan

482
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
You're really just a nobody

483
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,960
A'Zhun, you're used to not trusting people, right?

484
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
I guess it's very tiring to be alone

485
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
I won't ask you about your background in the future

486
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
You won't ask me about the past either

487
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Is that okay?

488
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
No

489
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Then there's nothing to talk about

490
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
You're quite stubborn

491
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
If you don't want to say it

492
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I won't ask you

493
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Are you feeling better?

494
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
It's nothing for a man to say

495
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
A man?

496
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
A man?

497
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
You said we two men were watching the moon here

498
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Isn't it awkward?

499
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
The moon itself is a symbol of reunion

500
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
When you look at the moon in the sunset

501
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
You'll think of your hometown

502
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
What's so strange about it?

503
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
What's so good about the moon in the Central Plains?

504
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
The night color of the grasslands is beautiful

505
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Have you been to the grasslands?

506
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
I just passed by

507
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
That's right

508
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
A businessman like Xia A'Zhun

509
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
must have been to many places

510
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
and seen many sceneries

511
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
But he can't stand the night color of Zheng Youzhou

512
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I really want to go to the grasslands

513
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Is the night sky there

514
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
as beautiful as you said?

515
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
You want to go to the grasslands?

516
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
I probably

517
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
won't have this chance

518
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
By the way

519
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
What business does A'Zhun do in Youzhou?

520
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Is it difficult?

521
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
It depends on the fate

522
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't believe in fate

523
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
I only believe in the sun

524
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I only believe in the human

525
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
I didn't expect people like A'Zhun

526
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
would believe in fate

527
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Human?

528
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Interesting

529
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
You're right

530
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
I was wrong

531
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
But A'Zhun is a businessman

532
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
He's interested in shooting with a gun

533
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
and is so skilled

534
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
I wonder who he is

535
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
I learned it myself

536
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I lost my parents since I was a child

537
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
I practiced these skills

538
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
just to survive

539
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
A'Zhun is still talented

540
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Unlike me, he's a coward

541
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
If you're tired, take a break

542
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
No

543
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I can do it

544
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Yao Tingzhi

545
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Get up

546
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Practice more

547
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm not afraid of anything

548
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Since this short knife was bought by Youning

549
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
I'll give it to you

550
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Xiao Youning has grown up

551
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
I'll use this knife sooner or later

552
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
to take the first place

553
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
and take the murderer of my A'Lian's fate

554
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
You've seen it all

555
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
You can take it back

556
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
You can take it back

557
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
after you've seen it all

558
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
You're so petty

559
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
You're really

560
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
like a girl

561
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I don't want to see it

562
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
It's boring

563
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I'm so tired

564
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I don't want to see it

565
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
It's boring

566
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I can't stand it

567
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
I'll go to the bathroom

568
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
and get some fresh air

569
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I won't

570
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
I'll go to the bathroom

571
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
and get some fresh air

572
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
It's boring

573
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
It's boring

574
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
It's boring

575
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
I'll go to the bathroom

576
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
and get some fresh air

577
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,600
Go on.

578
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,440
Thank you for your company tonight.

579
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,320
Master.

580
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,200
Why is the seller here?

581
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,280
Don't mind him.

582
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,080
Go to school.

583
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,600
Master.

584
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,400
Master.

585
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,800
The night color of the grassland

586
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,560
is not as beautiful as you think.

587
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,920
Your Highness.

588
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,840
What can I do for you

589
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,320
to summon me here?

590
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,040
I want to know about Changge.

591
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,640
Someone saw Princess Yongning

592
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,640
on the way to Youzhou.

593
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,000
It seems that Changge

594
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,640
is determined to fight against the enemy.

595
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,920
Your Highness.

596
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,040
The people I sent

597
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,640
are almost in Youzhou.

598
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,680
I can't let them die.

599
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,440
You are Princess Yongning's son.

600
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,240
You have been teaching her for years.

601
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
I can see it.

602
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
I know your kindness.

603
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,560
But

604
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,040
the joy of the Crown Prince

605
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,640
is not ordinary.

606
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,080
The Great Tang has made a great effort.

607
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,000
All kinds of forces are in danger.

608
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,840
Princess Yongning is still young.

609
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,800
She is still in the army.

610
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,000
Can she really

611
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,640
change people's minds

612
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,080
and deal with the evil?

613
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,800
If one day

614
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,720
someone is trying to

615
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
use the joy of the Crown Prince

616
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,200
to harm the country,

617
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,080
the consequences will be unimaginable.

618
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,360
Ke Bing.

619
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm tired.

620
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
You can leave now.

621
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,280
I'm sorry for my loss.

622
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,160
Your Highness is actually a wise man.

623
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,560
It's hard to change the world.

624
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,720
I hope you can

625
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,200
make the decision now.

626
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,640
I'll leave now.

627
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,600
A'Dou.

628
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,040
I don't know

629
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,720
if I can come back safely.

630
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,880
If I haven't returned yet,

631
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,600
you can take the joy of the Crown Prince

632
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
and ask A'Dou to take you away.

633
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
The seller?

634
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,080
Why him?

635
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,520
I don't know.

636
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,120
I just think he's a person

637
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,040
worth entrusting.

638
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,840
But...

639
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,800
This is the command.

640
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,320
I won't see you again, will I?

641
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,420
Yes.

642
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,360
I'd like to ask you

643
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,480
to dispatch

644
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,760
all the troops

645
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,120
to Gewu 필요 with your families.

646
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,560
Did you have any news

647
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,120
about Chang'an?

648
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,160
wireless.

649
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,120
No matter what,

650
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,280
they'll be assigned to your зачем

651
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Let's go.

652
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,480
Duoduo.

653
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,680
When did this happen?

654
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,280
The people in the Eastern Palace.

655
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,280
What?

656
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
The Eastern Palace

657
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,880
As the Crown Prince's old subordinate,

658
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,680
is this your way to treat guests?

659
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
The Eastern Palace is changing.

660
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,680
We have already surrendered to the court.

661
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,480
How can you be here?

662
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,680
The remaining evil of the Eastern Palace,

663
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,480
I advise you to just surrender to the Qin.

664
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,080
I'm here to see Lord Lu Jiang.

665
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,080
Lord Lu Jiang, how can you see him as you wish?

666
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm here to give Lord Lu Jiang a way out.

667
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Then you tell me first.

668
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,480
Youzhou is now a pawn.

669
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
It's a good opportunity.

670
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,680
Lord Lu Jiang doesn't want to fight with the army.

671
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Is he going to sit and wait?

672
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,080
You're talking nonsense.

673
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,280
Wait.

674
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,480
The Eastern Palace

675
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,280
Be careful, Duoduo.

676
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,880
This person may be a spy sent by the court.

677
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,480
It seems that I guessed it right.

678
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,080
The Prince is so nervous.

679
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
He must be preparing to disobey the court's orders.

680
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,280
Right?

681
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,880
Since you guessed it,

682
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,880
then I'll have to send you on the road.

683
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,880
Since the Prince has this intention,

684
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,080
Yong Ning died without regret.

685
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Yong Ning?

686
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,480
You're Xiao Yong Ning?

687
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,680
Brother Shuyu.

688
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,080
Leave.

689
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Yes.

690
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,080
We're finally in Youzhou.

691
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
How about this?

692
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,880
I'll escort the Princess to the clinic first.

693
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Then I'll go to Duoduo to meet you.

694
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Mr. Wei is the special envoy of Chang'an.

695
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,280
I don't need to go.

696
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,480
But what Mr. Wei is thinking is

697
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,280
not to escort the Princess,

698
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,880
but to avoid me

699
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,880
and find that princess.

700
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,680
Why do you frame me?

701
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,280
I don't escort the Princess.

702
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Do you want to escort her?

703
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,080
Why should I escort her?

704
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Since you said it,

705
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,880
then I'll order you

706
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,880
to protect her

707
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
and not to leave her.

708
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,680
Is it meaningful, Mr. Wei?

709
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,880
Yes.

710
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,080
Since it's the order of the Princess,

711
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,680
then let's arrange it this way.

712
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,080
And please send a letter to Chang'an

713
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,080
to inform the whereabouts of the Princess

714
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,680
so as not to worry about the Princess.

715
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,080
Tomorrow at this time,

716
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,080
we'll meet at the gate of the east gate.

717
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Stop talking nonsense.

718
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,280
These guards have been taken away by you

719
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
to protect the master.

720
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,880
These guards

721
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,480
are like warriors.

722
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,480
If I take them with the Princess,

723
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,680
they'll be noticed.

724
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Go.

725
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,680
I'll escort the Princess back to the inn to rest.

726
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,680
I won't bother the Princess to ride the horse.

727
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,080
I must get rid of this guy.

728
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Go.

729
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,680
According to the way of the Princess,

730
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,680
it's not too late to go.

731
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,680
I'm the Princess.

732
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,280
You must listen to me.

733
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,280
Okay.

734
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,080
Then you can go shopping.

735
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,680
Go.

736
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Be good.

737
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,480
Why don't you wait for me?

738
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
The Princess is holding on tight.

739
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,880
Otherwise, she'll fall down.

740
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,880
It has nothing to do with me.

741
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,680
Go.

742
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,480
There's a way to hide the truth.

743
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,080
You can get through this.

744
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,680
I'll go with you.

745
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,680
I just don't want to be in Chang'an

746
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,680
and fight with the Crown Prince.

747
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,080
Now I'm living alone.

748
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,680
Yongning,

749
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,680
you can be a good brother.

750
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,480
The Crown Prince can also

751
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
take the throne.

752
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,080
Uncle Tang,

753
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,080
I don't have Yongning anymore.

754
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,080
Just call me Changge.

755
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,680
I deserve to die.

756
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
It's okay, General Wang.

757
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,280
Get up.

758
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,880
I heard that you were very anxious.

759
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,880
Now that I see you,

760
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,280
you're really a good man.

761
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,280
Yongning,

762
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
don't be afraid.

763
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,680
Although the Crown Prince has left,

764
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,880
I'll protect you.

765
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I'll send someone to send you to...

766
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,080
Uncle Tang,

767
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
I'm not here to seek shelter.

768
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,280
I'm here to help you.

769
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,880
The Love by Hypnotic

770
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,480
Heart,

771
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
gradually responds,

772
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,080
gradually awakens,

773
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,280
gradually swims towards you.

774
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,080
Before saying goodbye,

775
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,080
gently,

776
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,080
I'll close your eyes,

777
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,280
and lock you in my tender dream.

778
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,080
Before dawn,

779
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,680
before the years pass,

780
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,480
my longing flows.

781
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,880
There's always a moment

782
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,680
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

783
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,080
There's always a longing

784
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,480
that unites us.

785
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,280
In different worlds,

786
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,680
in different worlds,

787
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,680
I'll be the one missing you.

788
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,480
Like the twinkling of an eye,

789
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
it becomes eternity.

790
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,680
The cocoon in the dark night sky.

791
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,280
There's always a moment

792
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,880
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

793
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,480
There's always a longing

794
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,080
that unites us.

795
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,680
In different worlds,

796
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,080
in different worlds,

797
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,480
I'll be the one missing you.

798
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,080
Like the twinkling of an eye,

799
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,280
it becomes eternity.

800
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,680
The cocoon in the dark night sky.

801
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,280
There's always a moment

802
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,280
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

803
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,280
There's always a longing

804
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,280
that unites us.
