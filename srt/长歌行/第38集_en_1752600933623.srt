1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm wearing the look of stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I have to face the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To sing the long yearning for him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He is the light of life and the light of the king

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's going on?

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's going on?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm afraid

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I come to send some treasures

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
One box

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My leader asked Tegin Sun

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is this the meaning of the Bodhisattva?

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Mobei is impulsive and ignorant

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He was very angry

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My leader regrets it very much

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Prime Minister Ashile, please forgive me

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is my intention

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I hope you can say more beautiful words for Mobei in front of the Great Khan

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
After the ceremony, I will give you a big gift

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ok

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Good stuff

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You must cherish it

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me see

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What good stuff?

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Tegin, don't worry

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My leader will never be so impulsive

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why is mine so small?

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is good

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Such a big one

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I've never seen such a big one

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who wants your shit?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Send the stuff to me later

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ok

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll share it, I'm fair

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Go

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So hard

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just for the silk

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There must be something important

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll go to the garden tonight

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You stay here for me

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What?

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You know such a thing?

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Can't I?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm asking you out

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are so unlucky

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Have you ever heard of a word called

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Flying book, passing love

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have the same feelings with her

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No need to know this

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You don't need to write more if you have the same feelings

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then what do you write?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No way

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have to teach you this

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you have any tricks?

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't write

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't write

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't write

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have to teach you this

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you have anything to say, just write it in

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ok, I don't read

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can write it without worry

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't peek

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ok, ok, ok

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You write, you write

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I won't peek

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You finished writing so fast

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't you write more?

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No need

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't peek

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ok, ok, ok, I know

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Sun Tegin said he would be back on time tonight

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then this is

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He just said he would let me return it to you

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Commander

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Have you checked the box?

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is there anything in the private warehouse?

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I didn't expect

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This famous Ashile Sun

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is so cunning

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The color of the sky

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is in your eyebrows

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's wrong

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You in my eyes

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
My heart is beating

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's like I'm falling

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The glimmer of light

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's how I feel

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The temperature of the eye

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How far you are from me

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How long the song is

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm calling you at the end of the lonely scene

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So hold your hand tight

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All unknown lights

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Light up the sky

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Light up the sky

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Qin Lang and the others told me

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That you decided to hide in Mobei without permission

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If it wasn't for the sake of saving the tribe

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I really want to catch you back quickly

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's wrong?

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did you use the powder today?

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's for Zhenzhu

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll go and get it

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll go and get it

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I might accidentally touch it

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is it good?

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It seems that this girl has a normal taste

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then don't use it next time

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's get to the point

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Why is Eagle Division here?

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course it's because of the military order

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let the people who are out of the hospital go to the battlefield

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It seems that the government is simply

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
People who want to cure Eagle Division are in danger

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Changge

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You know I don't want to

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Use the worst evil to make a fuss

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But the facts are right in front of you

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you want me to betray Ashile Tribe

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Betray Great Khan

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then I can't do it

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
She and I

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Are raised by the world

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't be a person who is betrayed

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What about Eagle Division?

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What about Eagle Division?

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have no choice

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There is

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I asked you to meet tonight

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Just want to tell you

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Except for betrayal and?

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is a third way

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
She agreed

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will give you the answer in two days

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I will warn you

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If I don't get the answer I want in two days

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I won't let you see the sun on the third day

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Sun

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The Bear Division asked me to go there

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Said there is something important to discuss

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's go

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why are you so ugly?

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You didn't sleep for a long time, did you?

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let me in

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to find Mu Jin and Sun Teqing

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let me in, I have something to do

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mimi

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let her go

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let me go

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let me go

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let me go

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't go with the Bear Division

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will die

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Sun

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I checked

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
As Mimi said

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The bear's bow and the head-on weapon

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Should have been aimed at the direction of the desert

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But now the angle is lowered

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There is no such big difference

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Obviously it's coming towards us

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's time

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You say something

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let me think about it

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What is there to think about?

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If it was before

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Does the team have the courage?

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There must be someone behind this

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Sun

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Even if we win this time

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We survived

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She let us go

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What about next time?

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What about next time?

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Only the Eagle Division is gone

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Can break their thoughts

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You go out first

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let me calm down

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's go Mimi

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Mimi, I have a question

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I know what you want to ask me

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I have something to tell you

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What?

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You are not going out

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The reason why I know this

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Because I sent it from the tooth bed

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then?

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The child who let the Eagle Division

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Infected with plague

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Because he looks

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,280
I would save him.

198
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,240
So...

199
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,560
You have a brother?

200
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,320
I was always in their hands.

201
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,120
They were my hostage.

202
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,520
They even made me destroy the purple grass.

203
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,280
Otherwise, I would kill him.

204
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,840
You saved Eagle Division.

205
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
You are the benefactor of Eagle Division.

206
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,240
I promise you.

207
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,960
I will try my best

208
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
to save your brother.

209
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,240
He is either dead or alive.

210
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't know.

211
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,320
Whether he is alive or not,

212
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,240
I will give you an explanation.

213
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,080
I and Sun will go to Tu Kashe first.

214
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,720
Don't feel burdened.

215
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,680
You will always be the family of Eagle Division.

216
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,640
It's my secret.

217
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,640
Mu Jin.

218
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,320
Come with me.

219
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,080
I'll go first.

220
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,600
You are here.

221
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Just this little food?

222
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm afraid it will take three days for the whole army to eat.

223
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,680
Isn't it enough to deal with

224
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,760
the ants in Mobei?

225
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,600
Mobei is a city of treasures.

226
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,280
What do you think?

227
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,760
Take what you want.

228
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Take what you want.

229
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Tegin is really

230
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,080
very trustworthy.

231
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
I will set the battle tomorrow.

232
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,520
I will use my power

233
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
to break through the Mobei cavalry

234
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
and take Mobei city

235
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,440
with my iron fist.

236
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,520
What do you think of Tegin?

237
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:28,960
Good.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,920
But not good enough.

239
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,640
What's your opinion?

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
You will set the battle tomorrow.

241
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,920
It's to give the opponent

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
a night of preparation.

243
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,080
The opponent will be exhausted and weak.

244
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,760
The battle will be

245
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,600
still unknown.

246
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,800
What do you mean?

247
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,760
We will set the battle time tomorrow.

248
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,000
But the real time for us to attack

249
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,640
is tonight.

250
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
A sneak attack?

251
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,880
While the opponent is relaxed,

252
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
we will be prepared

253
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
to beat them.

254
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,160
Then follow Tegin's idea.

255
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,880
Young Khan.

256
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,280
Step aside.

257
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I want to see Shuhan.

258
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,680
Please forgive me, Young Khan.

259
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
The Sheik is recuperating.

260
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
He Gross State Commandant said

261
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,120
no one is allowed to disturb me.

262
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,200
It's for a visit.

263
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,840
Can't we?

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,680
So, please don't make it difficult for me, Young Khan.

265
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,960
Shi.

266
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
Boss.

267
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Wait.

268
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,880
Prepare my brother.

269
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,280
Yeah.

270
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,640
A'Nao.

272
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Shu Han doesn't allow us to meet in private.

273
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,320
The order has been cancelled.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,600
What?

275
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,120
When did you say that?

276
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,560
Why didn't anyone tell me?

277
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,760
Great Khan told me himself.

278
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,480
What's wrong?

279
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,840
Nothing.

280
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,080
I...

281
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm just not used to it.

282
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
You'll get used to it gradually.

283
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,840
You're my son.

284
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,120
We shouldn't have separated.

285
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,160
But why did Shu Han agree all of a sudden?

286
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,080
Maybe your Shu Han is seriously ill

287
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
and thinks that family is precious.

288
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,080
I haven't seen Shu Han for so long.

289
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,560
I should go in and visit him.

290
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,560
And I have something to ask him.

291
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,520
Your Shu Han just took the medicine and fell asleep.

292
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,200
You can tell me everything.

293
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,920
Go ahead.

294
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,520
What do you want to ask?

295
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
Shu Han has led Eagle Division and Bear Division

296
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,920
to the north of the war.

297
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,080
What about my Wolf Division?

298
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,640
So what?

299
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,760
The chance to make a contribution

300
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
should be mine.

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,840
The Wolf Division has no idea about the battle of Weishui.

302
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
They've already fallen in front of the tribes.

303
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,960
Now the Wolf Division needs a battle

304
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,920
to prove themselves.

305
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm here to ask Shu Han for a battle.

306
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
I'll definitely take Mobei for Shu Han.

307
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,560
Sher.

308
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,760
Do you remember what I told you

309
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,840
when you were a kid?

310
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,680
A little misbehavior is a big mistake.

311
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,080
Now you should keep your strength.

312
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,040
As long as you're strong enough,

313
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
you won't have a chance to make a contribution

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,520
until the end.

315
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,520
This time, Shu Han sent me out

316
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,400
to patrol the border for a battle.

317
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,680
When I came back, I had to prepare the King's Pavilion

318
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,240
and the desert.

319
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,720
I think it's too soon.

320
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,600
It's not like what Shu Han saw.

321
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll show you something.

322
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,640
The seal...

323
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
Khan is seriously ill.

324
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,920
I'll take care of the seal.

325
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
From now on,

326
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
the whole tent

327
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,120
will be occupied by me, Khatun.

328
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
What?

329
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,920
Do you think your mother

330
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,680
can't afford this?

331
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,960
No.

332
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,840
It's just...

333
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,960
Sher.

334
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,400
You should be happy for your mother.

335
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,280
From now on,

336
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,360
I don't need to be patient anymore.

337
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
You can see me whenever you want.

338
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,760
You can go wherever you want.

339
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
Isn't that good?

340
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,560
Your father is seriously ill.

341
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
You can't work hard anymore.

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,760
From now on,

343
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,520
maybe the seal,

344
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,240
the tent

345
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,160
and the whole grassland

346
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,800
will be under your control.

347
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,360
You must be prepared.

348
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,200
All right.

349
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,480
Go back and rest.

350
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,600
Don't think too much.

351
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,160
Go.

352
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,360
Are you ready?

353
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,520
We're ready.

354
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Tonight,

355
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,240
we've worked hard on Eagle Division.

356
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
We'll cooperate well.

357
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,600
I'll lead Eagle Division to attack from the north.

358
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
Bear Division will attack from the south.

359
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,240
We'll attack from both sides.

360
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,680
Good.

361
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,160
Good.

362
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,880
Eagle Division, listen to my order.

363
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,800
Yes.

364
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Attack with me.

365
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,680
Yes.

366
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Eagle Division, attack!

367
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,640
Tu Kashe will be attacked, right?

368
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,720
We'll succeed, right?

369
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,960
Don't worry.

370
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,520
Everything is in the plan.

371
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
It's going to be dark soon.

372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Do you think you can see the sun tomorrow?

373
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,960
The sun is just right.

374
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,800
Commander, don't say such a silly thing.

375
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,040
Report!

376
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,960
Commander, Eagle Division is here.

377
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,080
Bring him in.

378
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,640
Yes.

379
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,080
Mingli.

380
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,480
Changge.

381
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,480
Mingli, why are you here?

382
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
It's a long story.

383
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,840
It's a long story.

384
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,000
I just met Sun Teqin.

385
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,680
He asked you to bring a message to the two leaders.

386
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,600
Tell me, what's the matter?

387
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,280
Zhu Ying is dead.

388
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,720
He's willing to send Mobei a big robbery tonight.

389
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,080
What are you waiting for?

390
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,520
Go and call the leader of the south.

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
Do you want me to call him personally?

392
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
Teqin, when will we attack?

393
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
Don't worry.

394
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
The more they are consumed,

395
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,760
the easier it will be for us to finish them off.

396
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Bear Division.

397
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,160
Yes.

398
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,040
Charge!

399
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,040
Charge!

400
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,560
Charge!

401
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,240
Where's Eagle Division?

402
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,320
Where's Eagle Division?

403
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,040
Yes.

404
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,800
We're ambushed.

405
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Where's Eagle Division?

406
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,080
Yes.

407
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,680
We're ambushed.

408
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,560
Ambushed?

409
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,720
Help.

410
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
We're ambushed.

411
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,320
We're from the north and south.

412
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,640
Oh no.

413
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,520
We're in trouble.

414
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,080
Retreat!

415
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Retreat!

416
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,640
Retreat!

417
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,520
Report!

418
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,600
Come in!

419
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,480
How's the battle?

420
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,440
Ashile Bear Division has been ambushed.

421
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,640
The leaders of the north and south have been ambushed.

422
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,600
The Bear Division has no more strength to fight.

423
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,360
What about Eagle Division?

424
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,560
How's Eagle Division?

425
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,600
Eagle Division has planned to

426
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,720
pretend to kill in the battlefield.

427
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
Then the whole army will retreat.

428
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,200
No casualties.

429
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,120
It's hard to imagine

430
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,840
that we can make such a dense

431
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,280
battle formation in three or four hours.

432
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,920
It's hard to imagine.

433
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
It's the way of the people of the Central Plains.

434
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,560
The Bodhisattva and the man of the yin don't understand.

435
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,080
It's her idea again.

436
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
It's scary.

437
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,520
Sun,

438
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,480
are you really not thinking about it?

439
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,600
This woman's mind is too scary.

440
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm afraid you'll be played by her.

441
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,200
Boring.

442
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Stop!

443
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,600
Xiaoqian, bad news.

444
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
The Tu Kashe has surrounded us

445
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
with Bear Division soldiers.

446
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,200
We can't let her go.

447
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,600
Kill!

448
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
Kill!

449
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
Who's there?

450
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Sun,

451
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
what do you mean?

452
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
You're a traitor.

453
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,640
You're betraying Great Khan.

454
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
I just want to live.

455
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
I want Eagle Division to live, too.

456
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Are you worth it?

457
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,760
You're a traitor.

458
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
You're a slave.

459
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,000
If Great Khan didn't punish you,

460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,960
how can you live till now?

461
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,240
I'll never forget

462
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
Great Khan's kindness.

463
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
But in the future,

464
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
I'll repay Great Khan

465
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
in my own way.

466
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm not worth it.

467
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,600
Is this how you repay him?

468
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
There's no good person in Eagle Division.

469
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,240
And you,

470
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Mu Jin,

471
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,920
you're shameless.

472
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,160
None of you want to live.

473
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,040
I'll report everything to Great Khan.

474
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,000
None of you can live.

475
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,120
You're so arrogant.

476
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's okay.

477
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,800
Tu Kashe,

478
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
you can't leave tonight.

479
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,480
The Commander asked me to tell you

480
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,800
that the plan has been successful.

481
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Please wait for Eagle Division to come back.

482
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Thank you.

483
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,840
Since the plan for the fake death

484
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
is successful,

485
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
I should go back.

486
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,000
Where are you going?

487
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
Eagle Division or Yazhang?

488
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Go.

489
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Mimi,

490
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
I already want to ask you

491
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
why did you know

492
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
that Xiong Shihui killed Eagle Division?

493
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,360
You're kind,

494
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,600
otherwise,

495
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
you wouldn't tell me all.

496
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
If you have any questions,

497
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
you can tell me,

498
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,000
and we can solve it together.

499
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I have a younger brother.

500
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
You told me

501
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,840
that Ashile people

502
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,880
made your family die.

503
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,880
Your brother is dead.

504
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Your brother is not dead.

505
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,520
You mean

506
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,760
he is in the tent now?

507
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,000
No.

508
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
He is in Dingxiang.

509
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
It's Yicheng.

510
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,000
He used my brother's life to threaten me

511
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,520
and forced me to join the Eagle Division's team.

512
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,240
Now, in the Eagle Division's team,

513
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,240
I have no choice

514
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,040
but to join the team.

515
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,760
I'd rather die.

516
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,840
Mimi,

517
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
you didn't hurt Eagle Division.

518
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,400
Instead, you helped Eagle Division.

519
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,840
Now that Eagle Division is dead,

520
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
you can be free.

521
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,960
How can I be free?

522
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,240
If my brother is still alive,

523
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,840
he will wait for me to save him.

524
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,240
Mimi,

525
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,880
we can discuss about saving your brother

526
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,720
when everyone comes back.

527
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,840
Just remember that

528
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,520
now Eagle Division is dead,

529
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,680
you are dead, too.

530
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,520
Nothing can threaten you.

531
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,760
Forget about the past.

532
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,320
From now on,

533
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,520
we will start over.

534
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,960
Start over?

535
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,880
Can I really start over?

536
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,880
The old Mimi is dead.

537
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,560
The future Mimi

538
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
will be a new Mimi.

539
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,040
You can be bold and free

540
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,680
to do what you want to do.

541
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
When everyone comes back,

542
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,800
we will figure out a way

543
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,080
to save your brother.

544
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,520
Su An.

545
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Wait.

546
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,120
Give me your helmet.

547
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,600
Eagle Division and Bear Division died here.

548
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
There must be evidence.

549
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,600
Mu Jin,

550
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,120
you don't have to do this.

551
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,000
Su An,

552
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880
someone will report to us.

553
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,800
We are always together.

554
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,920
Only when I go back alone

555
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,440
and tell them you are dead,

556
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,040
will they believe me.

557
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,600
You must live safely.

558
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't worry.

559
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,760
The plague didn't kill me.

560
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,920
I'm still alive.

561
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,200
If so,

562
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,080
you won't see Mimi for a long time.

563
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,360
It doesn't matter.

564
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,080
I have a selfish motive

565
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,520
to go back this time.

566
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,760
Take care.

567
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,200
Go.

568
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,720
Go.

569
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,440
Go.

570
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,120
Go.

571
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,720
Mimi.

572
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
Where are you going?

573
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,520
Go.

574
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,600
Look.

575
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,120
When I go back,

576
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,680
I'll trick the people of Yazhang

577
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,840
into going back.

578
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
You can't go back.

579
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,680
They won't let you go again.

580
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,720
Mimi,

581
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,720
believe me.

582
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,280
I will come back.

583
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,920
I promised you.

584
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,560
I will definitely find a way

585
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,680
to save your brother.

586
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,160
But Dingxiang is strict.

587
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,920
You are the only one.

588
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,240
How can you save him?

589
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,720
Let me go with you, okay?

590
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,920
Mimi,

591
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,600
I'm a man.

592
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,040
A man should do

593
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,320
what a man should do.

594
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,080
Promise me.

595
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
You must live well.

596
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,640
When I come back,

597
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,040
you can tell

598
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
who I am.

599
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,160
You are my man.

600
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,760
You must be responsible for me.

601
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,480
That's why

602
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,480
you must come back alive.

603
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm afraid that you'll be a fool

604
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,520
and can't keep your love.

605
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,640
I just hope that in the next life,

606
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,320
even if I'm only a fool,

607
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,320
there will be a moment.

608
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,640
The road ahead

609
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,560
is filled with laughter.

610
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,120
You fall in my eyes.

611
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,320
You become a fool.

612
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,400
When I come back,

613
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,960
I won't leave you again.

614
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,760
I just hope that in the next life,

615
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,160
even if I'm only a fool,

616
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,840
there will be a moment.

617
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,840
There will be a moment.

618
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,400
Flower of Raine.

619
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,600
I...

620
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,840
It's all over.

621
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I'll take you back.

622
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,760
I was worried about you last night.

623
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,040
I was afraid that the plan would change.

624
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,440
I was afraid that the Tukas would find out.

625
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,760
I was afraid that something would happen to you.

626
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,920
Master, thank you, Sun.

627
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,760
You won the battle safely.

628
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,080
I'm back.

629
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,360
From now on,

630
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,200
there will be no more Eagle Division.

631
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,680
There will be no more Eagle Division's special forces.

632
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Do you regret it?

633
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,600
The result is the best.

634
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,600
Eagle Division will no longer be disturbed by those selfish desires.

635
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,320
It will no longer be used as a way to kill.

636
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,080
I'm sorry.

637
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,440
Although Eagle Division is gone,

638
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
you can't come here

639
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,400
to make a bet.

640
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,680
What bet?

641
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,640
When you said you wanted to be my military counselor,

642
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,120
you promised me to do three things for me.

643
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,320
Are you trying to cheat me?

644
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,320
I didn't expect you to remember it.

645
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,000
Who am I?

646
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,680
I always keep my word.

647
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,680
Since you've mentioned it,

648
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
I guess you've thought of it too.

649
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,240
Tell me about it.

650
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,480
I haven't thought about it either.

651
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,240
But the first thing

652
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,840
has been on my mind for a long time.

653
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,760
In the future,

654
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,320
can you be more like a girl?

655
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,120
You mean

656
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,160
I'm not a woman enough?

657
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
No, no.

658
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,240
How could I...

659
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,040
I care about you.

660
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
I care about you to fight for your life

661
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,720
and to make a plan with all your heart.

662
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
Military counselor,

663
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,280
give me a chance.

664
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,440
Let me take the responsibility of a man.

665
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,520
I'll protect you in the future.

666
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
But I know

667
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,120
you're a wild horse.

668
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,320
You have your own world. I respect you.

669
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,200
I won't stop you no matter what you do.

670
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,680
But no matter what the situation is,

671
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,280
you can't risk your life alone.

672
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,080
You can't leave without a word.

673
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
We'll take on everything that happens.

674
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,320
Whether it's lightning or a sword,

675
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,720
it's up to Ashile Sun.

676
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,640
Do you understand?

677
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
Well,

678
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,480
I'll think about it.

679
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,600
Sun.

680
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,320
Sun.

681
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,080
Sun.

682
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,840
Sun.

683
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
Sun.

684
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,880
Sun.

685
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,880
Don't scare me.

686
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,920
Sun.

687
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Help.

688
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,640
Help.

689
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,240
Sun.

690
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
Sun.

691
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,240
Who left?

692
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,440
It's your and Bear God's

693
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
death.

694
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,620
Are they getting into a battle now?

695
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,300
Why did they pull out their army?

696
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,420
Are they going to extensive battle?

697
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,260
What's the outcome of this?

698
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Two armies are same.

699
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,540
Come on, this way?

700
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,920
Ash tends to be good at hospitality.

701
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,520
Why is Ash

702
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
What can I do?

703
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,720
Sun is dead.

704
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,000
It's meaningless for me to live.

705
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,600
I'll kill him.

706
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,760
I'll follow your order.

707
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,880
Sun is the God of War on the grasslands.

708
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,760
No one can kill him.

709
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,040
No matter how brave he is,

710
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
he can't block my knife.

711
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,120
In this place,

712
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,640
there are too many people who want his life.

713
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,680
Even so,

714
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,000
Sun has ordered me to come back

715
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,040
with the last breath

716
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,200
to inform his father.

717
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,640
The desert has been united.

718
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Ashile Tribe must be careful.

719
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,520
The desert

720
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,400
is very good.

721
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,600
I want them to be with Sun

722
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
until the end of the world.

723
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,760
Khatun.

724
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,080
Get up.

725
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,760
The matter of Eagle Division and Bear Division

726
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,640
is really a pity.

727
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm afraid that Khan

728
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,000
can't stand the pain of losing his son.

729
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,400
It's not good to get worse.

730
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,160
So, tell him

731
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,640
when he gets better.

732
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,360
Khan is ill?

733
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,520
It's been a while.

734
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,720
Now he can't even

735
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,920
speak.

736
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
What's wrong with him?

737
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,000
I don't know what kind of evil energy he has.

738
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,440
The great sorcerers are trying to save him.

739
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
It's a pity

740
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
that they haven't told Sun

741
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,440
about the secret of the secret.

742
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,160
They are separated

743
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,000
because of each other.

744
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,600
By the way,

745
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,760
you said that

746
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,720
Sun Te Qin's death

747
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,280
has a secret.

748
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,720
Yes.

749
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,880
Don't be afraid.

750
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,120
If there is a secret,

751
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,720
Great Khan will get justice for Sun Te Qin

752
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,520
and Eagle Division.

753
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,280
Khatun.

754
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,080
Eagle Division is a traitor.

755
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,760
Everyone was killed by this traitor.

756
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,760
It's my fault.

757
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,360
I shouldn't have been so obsessed

758
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,080
and brought that woman to the battlefield.

759
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,040
She attacked Sun behind my back.

760
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
What woman?

761
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,840
I don't know.

762
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,400
When I asked her,

763
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,440
she pulled out her sword and asked herself.

764
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Now,

765
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,080
I don't know who sent her.

766
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,160
I want to tell Eagle Division's Fu Rong

767
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,000
about these news.

768
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,920
Please take care of it.

769
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,380
Migrationazi

770
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,700
During the fell of the Mcornaoticuan litteration,

771
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,100
Khan sent all Eagle Division and Bear Division to attack me.

772
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,580
Unfortunately, they were ambushed on the way.

773
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,140
What a pity!

774
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,820
Khan,

775
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,300
do you feel very familiar with this?

776
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,300
Do you want to

777
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,940
acknowledge this?

778
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,500
It looks like Khan does not have bail pain.

779
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
to recognize

780
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,500
the head of Ashile Sun.

781
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
You miss him

782
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
day and night.

783
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Let him

784
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
stay with you.

785
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
iki

786
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500

I will never forget you.

803
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
I will never forget you.

804
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
I will never forget you.

00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
I will never forget you.

806
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500

00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
I will never forget you.

00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
I will never forget you.

810
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
I will never forget you.

811
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
I will never forget you.

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
I will never forget you.

815
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
I will never forget you.

816
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
I will never forget you.

817
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I will never forget you.

818
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
I will never forget you.

828
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
In different worlds,

829
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
in different worlds,

830
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,500
my wish and yearning are all in one.

831
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,500
Just like that little flame,

832
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,500
it has become eternity,

833
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,500
the cocoon in the dark night.

834
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:37,500
The cocoon in the dark night.
