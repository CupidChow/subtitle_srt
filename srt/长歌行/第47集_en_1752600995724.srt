1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has been through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to return to the long yearning with him

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the one who never forgets his craziness

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You still have a big appetite

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can promise you to cure Mu Jin first

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
As for your father

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
After the Eagle Division finished the imperial edict for me

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will let you two reunite

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You finally admit it

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You did cause my father's illness

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's the point of saying this now?

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He saved all of this

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In order to make him the throne

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He was stained with blood

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Could it be that

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Khan of Shule was also your pen?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
As a woman who married a stranger

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't have much choice

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You killed Shule's father

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Have you considered his feelings?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When did you care about Shule so much?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You don't have to worry about my son

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mother

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mother

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mother

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You told me

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You were punished a lot

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you here?

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Tell me

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
As long as I pray to the God of Heaven

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He won't take A'Da away

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I kneel in front of the river every day

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And pray to the God of Heaven

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
To make A'Da get better

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To make A'Da not abandon us

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Mother, say something

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I remember when I was a kid

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A'Da used to tell me

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We are men

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We have to protect Mother

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And treat her well

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Even if you ask for the stars in the sky

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She will still give them to you

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Mother

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why?

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
With your father

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
With Yan Li Kehan

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't go back to my homeland

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't go back to my homeland

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't go back to the Sui dynasty

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But the grasslands are your home

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Sui dynasty is gone

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Shut up

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The grasslands you talk about

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Are just my prison

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am the daughter of the Sui dynasty

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As long as I live

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will never die

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have been gone for so long

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So far

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Our Sui dynasty

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Will be reborn soon

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
One day

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are crazy

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You are crazy

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are crazy

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You have been lying to me

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You have been lying to me

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Guards

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Take Kehan back to his bed

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And keep him well

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you doing?

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't you understand?

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Guards

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Congratulations, Prince of Doufu

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't be so polite

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Call me Hao Du

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ok

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Where is Princess Hao Du?

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Brother Shuyu

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you here?

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I thought it was Changge

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I am here to deliver things for Changge

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This fan

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Changge made it by hand every night

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a wedding gift for you and Prince of Fu

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Where is Changge?

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She left

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She is afraid of saying goodbye

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Especially for you

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So she asked me to give this gift

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
She told me

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You will always be the rabbit in her heart

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You must be happy

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is my love

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hao Du

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Leyan is my sister forever

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can't bully her

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If she is not happy

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will take her away

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't worry

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You won't have this chance

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hao Du

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I am afraid I won't see Changge again

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't worry

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have asked around

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Your father sent Li Jing to Dingxiang

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He is my father's person

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And Changge's people

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They will be fine

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Leyan

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have a request

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You and I

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
need to talk about this

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My father is getting worse

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
His biggest wish

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
is to see us get married

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I am afraid he can't make it

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I understand

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We will hold a small ceremony in Du's mansion

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Without the nobles

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Only you and me

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and father

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I am afraid I am wronged

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think it's worth it

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to fulfill my father's wish

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Li Shimin

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
has appointed Li Jing

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
as the commander of the Dingxiang Dao

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And Li Ji

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
as the commander of the Tonghan Dao

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The governor of Hua Zhou, Chai Shao

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is the commander of the Jinhe Dao

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The governor of Lingzhou, Xue Wanche

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
is the commander of the Changwu Dao

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The chief general is Li Jing

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He was the leader of Eoyangling yesterday

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How many soldiers and horses are there?

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
More than 10,000

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ashile Tribe has many tribes

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If we recruit soldiers and horses

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we may not lose to Li Jing

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How is the war in the west?

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yesterday, Ashile Valley

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
was defeated by the leader of Mobei

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Pu San

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The leader of Mo Nan, Yi Nan

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
has joined the desert tribes

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and defeated the four tribes of Ashile Tribe

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
All the four generals were promoted

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Some tribes agreed to recruit soldiers

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
but there is no news yet

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I guess

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Guess what?

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
They have been bribed

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Can I treat them?

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
As you said

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I am just a wounded man

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can get out of bed

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Good

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can ask them to meet each other

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You go to the bath house

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and ask Ashile Sun to take you

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let him see Mu Jin

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
before seeing him

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Princess

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He looks like this now

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Will Ashile Sun

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
feel bad when he sees him?

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
In Dingxiang

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ashile Sun cares about

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mu Jin and Yan Li the most

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I don't let him see them

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
how can he be willing to be used by me?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It doesn't matter

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I just want him to see

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
how his father

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is in my hands

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Father

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I am late

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Tao

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's me

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sun

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Tao

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait for me

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I will pick you up

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Tao

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wait for me

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Tao

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I won't bother you anymore

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't worry

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I won't kill him

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Remember what you said

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Otherwise

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I will take Eagle Division to Dingxiang

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Then please

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
write a military order to Mu Jin

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
in person

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I will give you five days

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Five days later

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I will gather all the elite

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
in front of the Chengqi Gate of the palace

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and listen to your orders

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Then

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I will treat your father well

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Tao

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Be careful

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Sun

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I knew it was you

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mu Jin

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I am late

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How can they treat you like this?

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It doesn't matter

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's good that they are still alive

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They sent the Thunder Alliance to monitor us

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You suffered

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't want to be a burden

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't say that

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sun

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why are you here?

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You and father are in Dingxiang

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How can I stay in Tang alone?

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What about Mimi?

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Mimi is here too

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But she can't see us now

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I have seen Puzhen

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Ashile Sun

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Khatun sent you to do business

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mu Jin

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is the military order I wrote

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Bring her

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Gather the elite

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What?

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Shaoer

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's late

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why are you looking for me?

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You tell me

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Am I the dumbest fool in the world?

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You are drunk

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will help you back

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You

251
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You tell me

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Am I the dumbest fool?

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
My father killed my father

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
My father killed my father

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Shu Han deliberately killed my wolf

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
To separate me from Sun

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Now

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
My father poisoned Shu Han

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And this time I am

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What?

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They dare to do it and don't let me say

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Come here

263
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Liars

264
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All are liars

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
My mother lied to me

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Look at me

267
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Take care

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Go

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Go

270
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Go

271
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You are awake

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why am I here?

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You drank too much last night

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Drink some water

275
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Thank you

276
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why are you looking at me?

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You

278
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You are so nice

279
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Shaoer

280
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I know you always treat me as a friend

281
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But after all, we are strangers

282
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If Biketoon knows that you were here last night

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I will be scolded again

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Sorry

285
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I will go now

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know why I suddenly came to you

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Maybe I think you are the safest here

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you are in a bad mood in the future

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You can still come to me

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank you

292
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You still remember that I told you

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
When I become the Great Khan

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I will marry you to be my Khatun

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes

296
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But now

297
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't want to be the Great Khan

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Go

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Are you afraid that I will die?

300
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No

301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Father will definitely help you

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You are getting worse

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You are making the decision yourself

304
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You are busy with the wedding in advance

305
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You are not afraid of being wronged by the Princess?

306
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Liu Yuan said that she is not wronged

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And I have already pleaded guilty to the Emperor

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The Emperor has approved it

309
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Everything is in order

310
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The Princess is afraid that you will be embarrassed

311
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And you can marry such a considerate wife

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's a blessing

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I will treat the Princess well

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And respect the Emperor

316
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Father

317
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you have any relatives or friends

318
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
To come to the wedding together?

319
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Since you have decided to save everything

320
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Then we four family members are far enough

321
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Besides, I have many diseases

322
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't need to let my relatives and friends

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
To worry about me

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's all

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Father

326
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You will definitely get better

327
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I know my body

328
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But you

329
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Follow Li Jin to attack Dingxiang

330
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a good opportunity to build a career

331
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But you gave up for me

332
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't think I don't know

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Father, there is only one

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
There are many opportunities to build a career

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I just don't want to have any regrets

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You still say you are not afraid of me dying

337
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I heard Li Changge went to Dingxiang

338
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
After the wedding

340
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You will leave for Dingxiang immediately

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If Li Changge dies

342
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
How will you explain to the Princess?

343
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But father, your body

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You don't have to worry about me

345
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can arrange the wedding in advance

346
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's already effective

347
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Now is the time

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You have to respect the Emperor

349
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And protect the Princess

350
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The person she cares about

351
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
This is what you should do as a man

352
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I understand

353
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Father

354
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You must wait for me to come back

355
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Dingxiang has no result

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Father will not die

357
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I will wait for you

358
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You never thought about letting me lead the army to fight

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You just want to use my hand to summon the Eagle Division

360
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Khatun is a good way

361
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The army is not a fool

362
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Tegin is a man who has been on the battlefield for a long time

363
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Of course you should understand this

364
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
After the battle

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I will allow you to personally gather the Eagle Division to fight

366
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If you are a man

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Really make people anxious

368
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Listen

369
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The Eagle Division should be here

370
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's gathering at the gate of the palace

371
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Tegin

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Guess who will be the one to make the call

373
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You make my father sick and can't talk

374
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
How can he make the call

375
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
As long as he is here

376
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I am your father's mouth

377
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why didn't you see Tegin follow me

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What's wrong with the call

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm going to ask Khatun

380
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wait a minute

381
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Do as planned

382
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Use the fire card

383
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Save Khan

384
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
No need to worry about me

385
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Where are you going out of the city

386
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Go to the Tang army meeting room

387
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Princess

388
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's noisy outside

389
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Out of the city

390
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm going to the city

391
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Why is it noisy outside

392
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What happened

393
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Eagle Division fled and took Khan away

394
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Now I'm going out of the city

395
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
what

396
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Ashile Sun

397
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's you

398
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The army is not good

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The princess's mechanism is poor

400
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
After all, it was the Eagle who caught the eye

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You pretend to be cheated

402
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
To save Yan Li

403
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You are a woman

404
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Naturally unable to face the facts

405
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You won't let Sher go

406
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Not to mention me

407
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So you can only let Khan show up

408
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Good you Ashile Sun

409
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Really a guy who is not afraid of death

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Even if I don't do this

411
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Will you let me go

412
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Lei Meng

413
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes

414
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Pass on the order

415
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Notify the grasslands

416
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Eagle Division defected

417
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Take Khan away

418
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Dingxiang cavalry is chasing

419
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Khan died in the hands of Eagle Division

420
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I have the token of Khan

421
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I will take the military order

422
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yes

423
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And

424
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Notify the heads of the Ashile Tribe

425
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Immediately set out to Dingxiang

426
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Three days later at noon

427
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I want to kill one nine hundred

428
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes

429
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Good one kill one nine hundred

430
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But since I came to Dingxiang

431
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I never thought of living

432
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Even if you slander me

433
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's better than being your dog

434
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
rest assured

435
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I won't let you die in vain

436
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I want to let each department see

437
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What is the result of betraying me

438
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Changge

439
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
If possible

440
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I really want to be with you forever

441
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm going to break my promise

443
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The people from the Department of Drama are here

444
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry

445
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
People from the Department of Drama are here

446
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
People from the Department of Times are here

447
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Xiao Zhugong

448
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Why do you hit people when you meet?

449
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Why are you here

450
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I notified

451
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Don't scold me

452
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If it weren't for you

453
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I won't do this if I don't notify the doctor

454
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I want to come and go

455
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Just can't rest assured

456
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's why I notified him

457
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Princess Tu is right

458
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Xiao Zhugong

459
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Why are you alone?

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I received the news several times

461
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
My brothers from the Department of Drama are going to fight

462
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The rest of the 18 are with Situ Lang Lang

463
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Will come soon

464
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Shu Yu

465
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
General Li and I ask for your help

466
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I didn't expect to meet your friend

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Know you are here

468
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Great

469
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We can both go through difficulties

470
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yes

471
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Friends should have both blessings and difficulties

472
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
rest assured

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This time we are all on your side

474
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I will definitely help you rescue the new killer

475
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Thank you all

476
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So what do we do now?

477
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
First, we have to enter the city gate

478
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And we have so many people

479
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Must think of a better way

480
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Isn't it just a city?

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm here

482
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hmm

483
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
This

484
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
In the past, the department of the Department of Drama

485
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Will send out such a token

486
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You are Xiao Zhong

487
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
With this

488
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You can also enter the station

489
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You stole your mother's token

490
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
How can I take you to the city without her?

491
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Moreover

492
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I took my mother's things

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
How can I steal?

494
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Just use it

495
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Anyway, I won't use it anymore

496
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Waste iron

497
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Everyone, let's go

498
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Go

499
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Fate is too stubborn

500
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Let me choose to be stubborn

501
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Give everything

502
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But exchange for the life of the heart

503
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
How much love is needed

504
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Can be without hesitation

505
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Heart is broken

506
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Can't be vain

507
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Love is like an old song

508
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,720
Use my life to put it in the

509
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Qingzhu

510
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Ask why

511
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Can't escape from the world

512
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Not afraid of being left alone

513
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In the sky

514
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
As long as you can

515
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Think of me

516
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I will be there

517
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Can be happy

518
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
People are too greedy

519
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I haven't been there for a long time

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Use all your strength

521
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm not afraid of being late

522
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
How much love is needed

523
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Can be without hesitation

524
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Heart is broken

525
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Can't be vain

526
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Love is like an old song

527
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Use my life to put it in the

528
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Qingzhu

529
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Ask why

530
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Can't escape from the world

531
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Three bows

532
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Not afraid of being left alone

533
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
In the sky

534
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Get up

535
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
As long as you can be happy

536
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Love is like an old song

537
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Use my life to put it in the

538
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Qingzhu

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Ask why

540
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Can't escape from the world

541
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Not afraid of being left alone

542
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
In the sky

543
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
As long as you can

544
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Think of me

545
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
As long as you can

546
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Think of me

547
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
As long as you can be happy

548
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I

549
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I now

550
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I think all this is like a dream

551
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can't believe it's true

552
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
From now on

553
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I am your wife

554
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We two

555
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Never leave

556
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Until death do us part

557
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I am your wife

558
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Never leave

559
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Until death do us part

560
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Then, wife

561
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I swear

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
On the night of the wedding

563
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Don't say such impolite words

564
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I believe you

565
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But

566
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm going to Dingxiang tonight

567
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Go go

568
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But you must promise me

569
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Protect yourself

570
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Protect Changge

571
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Help Li Gong

572
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Eradicate the plague

573
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I and Ayi are waiting for you to come back

574
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Must

575
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I listen to you everything

576
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,860
The

577
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
Xu Feng. He's going to inquire about the news

578
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
He can play the role regardless of where he is

579
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I have something important to tell you

580
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,840
You go buy some flour, nuts,

581
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
oil and other ingredients for the music troupe.

582
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,360
And buy some lighters.

583
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,840
It's the most important thing.

584
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,720
Changge, what are you doing?

585
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,040
Connecting the internal force.

586
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,480
Xiao Zhugong.

587
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
I know why the chiefs of the department were called into the city.

588
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,680
Mimi.

589
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,440
Sher.

590
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,000
Why are you here?

591
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,480
Oh no.

592
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,160
Ketun called the chiefs of the department to enter the city.

593
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,000
Tomorrow noon,

594
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,400
we're going to see Ashileus' killer.

595
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
Wearing the arms,

596
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,560
we'll be brave.

597
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,160
What?

598
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,040
No.

599
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,680
I won't let him die.

600
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,760
What are you thinking?

601
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,400
Don't you know Ketun's temperament?

602
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,440
Who can change the decision he made?

603
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,360
Who is so bad?

604
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,720
Why did you put on the light?

605
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,360
Mimi.

606
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,160
Sher.

607
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,720
The music troupe of the Xiaomu family.

608
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,640
What?

609
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,280
I'll leave the great Khan to you.

610
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,240
Don't worry.

611
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
I have a contract with Qin.

612
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,920
I'll make sure Khan's life is safe.

613
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,280
Thank you.

614
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,880
You're not staying.

615
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,680
Where are you going?

616
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,960
The task is done.

617
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,080
I have something to deal with.

618
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,680
You...

619
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,840
Mu Jin.

620
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
You're so rude.

621
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,000
We're brothers.

622
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,480
You don't call us.

623
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,440
What?

624
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,240
Only you have the chance to save Ketun?

625
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,240
That's right.

626
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
Are you looking down on us?

627
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,840
Let's go.

628
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,360
Go.

629
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,880
The superior ordered that the maid can't go out.

630
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,000
My dear men.

631
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,840
I'm Khan's maid.

632
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,080
I've been having a bad appetite.

633
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,840
I've been eating the music troupe.

634
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,560
May I ask you to go out and buy some?

635
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,360
It's not the Mid-Autumn Festival.

636
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,920
How can I buy the music troupe?

637
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
You'll know when you go out.

638
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,640
If I do as you say,

639
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,600
Ketun will be much more comfortable.

640
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,440
I'll buy the rest of the money for the wine.

641
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,240
Alright.

642
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,560
I'll find it for you in the city after I change the room.

643
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,120
I know.

644
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280
If you can't buy it,

645
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
don't blame me.

646
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,920
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

647
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,160
Take a look.

648
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
This is quite good.

649
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
The music troupe.

650
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,960
The music troupe is on sale.

651
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,720
The music troupe is on sale.

652
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,840
The music troupe is on sale.

653
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,160
The music troupe is on sale.

654
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
Give me these two bags.

655
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,080
Alright, Mr. Guan.

656
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,360
Here.

657
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,920
Master.

658
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,880
How is it?

659
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,400
I'm here faster than you thought, right?

660
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,160
Luo Shiba and I

661
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,960
ran here several horses

662
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,480
day and night.

663
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
That's why we're here.

664
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,680
Tell me.

665
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,120
How could I hand you over to such a stupid disciple?

666
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,600
Are you a coward or a sharp-edged sword?

667
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,680
How dare you break into the Dingxiang City alone?

668
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,000
Master.

669
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,360
Luo Shiba has met them at the inn.

670
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,280
If you need me to do anything,

671
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,680
just tell me.

672
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,280
It's less than three hours from noon.

673
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,400
Take the people

674
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,880
to meet with the people of Wei Shu Yu.

675
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,720
We'll make a plan

676
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,040
and then make a plan.

677
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,000
Be careful.

678
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,680
Go.

679
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,880
Come on.

680
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,880
I don't want to.

681
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,960
I'm op mattresses.

682
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,240
I didn't just make a mess.

683
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,720
I knew you were a bad guy.

684
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,400
How dare you easily go back to see me?

685
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,840
I didn't expect you to die in front of others.

686
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,320
Princess 길.

687
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,840
Take care of Chen Huan.

688
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,160
Go back to Isekai

689
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,960
and catch up with Li Chengge.

690
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,120
Go ahead.

691
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,400
Shh...

692
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,400
What are you doing?

693
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,160
Dismiss your sword.

694
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,000
Sher.

695
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,280
Your Highness, I'm a lowly Khan.

696
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,120
It's not a big deal for me.

697
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,200
Sheng.

698
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,440
Thank you.

699
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,840
I said

700
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,680
I was atone for my father.

701
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,680
Besides, I don't like to die.

702
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Are you hurt, Fang Post?

703
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:17,600
See you, Senior況

704
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,520
Wait a moment.

705
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,160
Master Xiao,

706
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,680
what are we waiting for?

707
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,800
Ashile respect has been punished.

708
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,440
We're waiting for an image on the map

709
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,520
to post the position of Crown Prince Chu.

710
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,960
Little along

711
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,080
How could it be so detailed?

712
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,720
Unless

713
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,400
you arranged a spy in the palace.

714
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,360
Could it be that Mimi?

715
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,640
Don't say that.

716
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,560
No.

717
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,400
It's really her.

718
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,440
Then,

719
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,520
is it possible that I wrongly blamed her?

720
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,440
Li Cheng has been threatening Mimi.

721
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,160
Not only did she not give up,

722
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,520
she has been helping me.

723
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,360
You must punish her.

724
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,540
So that she will repay me.

725
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,040
It's not as easy as that.

726
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,460
So it doesn't matter.

727
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,940
It just hurts her feelings.

728
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,940
Do you mean it hurts my feelings?

729
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,200
Your masters should be punished according to their own sort of gameplay.

730
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,640
He Kai.

731
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,340
Li Cheng is different from every champion of Henan.

732
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,940
You can see him,

733
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,300
but he is still the kind of champion that you should win.

734
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,040
Yes.

735
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,040
My supports

736
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,140
are the same as yours.

737
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,060
All your supporters

738
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:39,060
Your figure is locked in my tender dream

739
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,060
Before dawn, before dawn

740
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,060
The longing flows

741
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,060
There is always a moment

742
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,060
Burn into the wastelands in my heart

743
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,060
There is always a longing

744
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,060
Between you and me

745
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Everything is frozen

746
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
In each other's world

747
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,060
In different worlds

748
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:17,060
Our longings become a cocoon

749
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,060
The deep love that we have

750
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
Becomes eternity

751
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:28,060
The cocoon in the night sky

752
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,060
There is always a moment

753
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,060
Burn into the wastelands in my heart

754
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,060
There is always a longing

755
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,060
Between you and me

756
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,060
Everything is frozen

757
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
In each other's world

758
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,060
In different worlds

759
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,060
Our longings become a cocoon

760
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,060
The deep love that we have

761
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,060
Becomes eternity

762
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,060
The cocoon in the night sky
