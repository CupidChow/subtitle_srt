1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My heart is burning

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Towards the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still has to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid you'll forget

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The memory of this is the shape of my stubbornness

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to him and sing a song of hope

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is the river of life and the river of hope

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ask around

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How does the western suburb's fat go?

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Not clear

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ask another one

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How about this?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How does the western suburb's fat go?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Keep going

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Go to the end

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then turn a few turns to the west

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You'll know when you get there

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Be careful on the way

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
wontons

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want wontons

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to get some

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where is Liu Yan?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know him

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't have time to play with you

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Look carefully

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the government's token

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Liu Yan is the daughter of the emperor

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If anything happens to you

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can take responsibility

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Liu Yan is really the princess

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She is the princess

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She is the princess

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She is the princess

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She is the princess

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She is the princess

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She is the princess

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She is the princess

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Liu Yan is really the princess

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She is the princess

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You really saw Liu Yan?

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where is she?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you a liar?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I tell you

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was looking for the princess in the government

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But I didn't find her

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Obviously you hid her

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Or I'll call Yun Zhongming's mansion now

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Little boy

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You should have come earlier

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Liu Yan left yesterday

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Gone?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you know where she went?

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Recently, the government

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let the people of the border sign

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She went to Luoyang with the team

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you chase now

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Maybe you can meet

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Things

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh my god

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Liu Yan is really the princess

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She is the princess

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What should we do?

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We are done

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What should we do?

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh my god

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I scolded her

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I even slapped her palm

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I slapped her several times

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Lady Chang

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We let the princess do the rough work every day

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Stay up late to repair things

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are we going to die?

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If I knew she was the princess

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I would have brought her more sesame cakes

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What should we do?

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What should we do?

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on, eat

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's go over there

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ok?

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Shopkeeper

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Your lanterns look good

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Shopkeeper, I want to ask

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are the people selling sheep and wool cloth?

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can see some shops

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When you walk forward

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They are all together

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not talking about shops

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a girl

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She is cold

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Selling some loose clothes

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She was here yesterday

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I remember

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There was a woman selling cloth

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She took someone's purse

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The owner caught her

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you know where she went?

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
People selling loose clothes on the street

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are from the West Street branch

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why don't you go there and ask?

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You are welcome

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's see this

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's see

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hao Du

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why is he in Yunzhou?

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Leng Yan

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Lady Chen

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Lady Chen, look

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Someone is looking for Leng Yan again

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are here for the princess, right?

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How do you know she is...

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A man came to me just now

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
To find Princess Leng Yan

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Princess Leng Yan

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Has gone with the team to Nanqian yesterday

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hao Du is here to find Leng Yan

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He just left

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you go after him now

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You will catch up

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Leng Yan

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He must have suffered a lot

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I thought I could see him again

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And return this to him

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why is this purse with you?

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Leng Yan lost this purse yesterday

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Said it was from his best friend

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He cried for a long time

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We tried to persuade him for a long time

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What happened to him?

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't be sad, young man

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Leng Yan is here

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He must have suffered a lot

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Right

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He is so nice to him

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Right

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He even embroidered for us

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He made a lot of money

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The money he took on the way

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Is enough for him to go to Luoyang

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Since it's the princess

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She is lucky

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She will be fine

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't worry

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't worry

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's good

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hold on

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hold on

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Follow up

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why is everyone gone?

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why is the horse's foot empty?

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Where is Sun?

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why are you alone?

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You don't need to report

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
To Sun's account now?

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I ask you where he is

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He went to the bank

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Bank?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You think I am a three-year-old child?

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I need to take half of the horse

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Every time the big brother calls

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's all his fault

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't know

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Every time the big brother calls

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's all because he took so many people

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yan Li is suspicious

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
How could he let Yin Shi take so many people?

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Not to mention they are all exquisite

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Say

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Did something happen?

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, nothing happened

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I just organized it

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I told you it's okay

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you all suspicious?

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Jingzhou

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Isn't Jingzhou Luo Yi's Tianjie Army?

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What does the painting on it mean?

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Nothing

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army is defeated

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why is Luo Yi's Tianjie Army defeated?

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Brother Cheng

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't think too much

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army is defeated

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The gate of the northern border will be open

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And Ashile Tribe

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Will be full of people and horses

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Chang'an

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Brother Cheng

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you going to do?

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Brother Cheng

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I heard you came back from Yunzhou

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where is Brother Cheng's short knife?

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm not sure

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just went to the mountain to check

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If there's no short knife

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't think it's a good idea

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I just want to see if there's a knife

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There's no knife

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's good

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll go to the mountain to check

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll go to the mountain to check

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go

215
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Go

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Go

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Go

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Go

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Go

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Go

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Go

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Brother Cheng

227
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Did he run away?

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Brother Cheng is not like this

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm just joking

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't worry

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
With his character

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We wouldn't be treated unluckily

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,300
I can guess where he is

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What d you mean?

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He should be going after Sun

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I was careless

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I forgot the map of Sun's permanent referral

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
To talk about the point

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
The point is

241
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
There's news from a strong point

242
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,680
South.

243
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
South?

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,880
Another attack?

245
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,440
This time,

246
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,480
the rebellion of Luo Yi, the leader of Jingzhou,

247
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,720
was defeated by Tang.

248
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
Now, Jingzhou has lost its power.

249
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
Great Khan took the opportunity to go south

250
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,120
and took the throne as the father of Tang.

251
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,640
Isn't that...

252
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,520
Tale of sayin

253
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,840
We are here to pay respect to Your Majesty.

254
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,000
Rise!

255
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,800
His Grace.

256
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
General General Yuchi is here,

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
and he has handed over

258
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,480
this military report to him.

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,960
no matter what lid you follow

260
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,240
Now that the Dивine Army has menaced south of A'shele

261
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
with 2 political figures and two forwards

262
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
they're going to their serve

263
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,660
I guess they'll be here in 2 days

264
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,620
What about our own army then?

265
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
I know

266
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,420
Today

267
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,620
I invite you here

268
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,620
to discuss a countermeasure

269
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,620
As you see

270
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,220
Yan Li

271
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,020
What's his purpose?

272
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,620
Jingzhou has been broken

273
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Gaoling is hard to protect

274
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,120
If he goes down

275
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,620
it's

276
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,020
He wants Chang'an

277
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Chang'an is the foundation of our Tang Dynasty

278
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,620
Nothing can happen

279
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,220
If he can stop Ashile Tribe's attack in Gaoling

280
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,820
maybe he can fight for the reinforcements of various states

281
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,620
Your Majesty

282
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
I want to go to Gaoling

283
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,020
No

284
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,420
If the gate is open

285
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,020
what should we do?

286
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
Your Majesty

287
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,220
Do you want to put the final battle place in Jingyang?

288
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,820
The battle is direct

289
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,020
with the cavalry

290
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,620
and the cavalry is the most important

291
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,620
Jingyang is surrounded by mountains

292
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,820
and the terrain is complicated

293
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,220
It's a natural barrier

294
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
But Zhang Jiyou is the best

295
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
Yu Shi, Jingde

296
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
Yes, Your Majesty

297
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,620
I order you to be the commander of the military

298
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,420
and send 50,000 soldiers

299
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
to go there today

300
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,620
and attack Ashile Tribe with Jingyang

301
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,020
to delay the battle

302
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,220
You can't fail

303
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Yes, Your Majesty

304
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
The war has started

305
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,420
The border is close

306
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,420
and we have to suffer from the storm

307
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,220
How's the progress of the south-south move

308
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,220
arranged by the people of Beijing?

309
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Your Majesty

310
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,820
The news has been passed on

311
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
In a few days

312
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,020
hundreds of teams have been gathered

313
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
to attack the south-south move

314
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
In the battle with Ashile Tribe

315
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
I'd rather not win

316
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,220
than to win

317
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Tang can't stand such a small attack

318
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,220
and the people can't stand

319
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
being attacked by the fire

320
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
It's almost time

321
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Have a rest

322
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,220
Have a rest

323
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Have some water

324
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Have some water

325
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
My cake

326
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Stop

327
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,220
Stop, kid

328
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Kid, stop

329
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Stop

330
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Stop

331
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,220
The cake has been eaten by the kids

332
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,220
Let me spit it out

333
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,220
It's you again

334
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Last time I gave you a red-crab cake

335
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,220
and you stole my money

336
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
This time you stole my cake again

337
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
Are you full?

338
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
I have more

339
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
What's wrong with you?

340
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,220
I'm full

341
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Stop

342
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
Stop

343
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Stop

344
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Stop

345
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Stop

346
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,220
Stop

347
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Stop

348
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Stop

349
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
Stop

350
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Stop

351
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Stop

352
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Stop

353
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Stop

354
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
Stop

355
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Stop

356
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
Stop

357
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Stop

358
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
Stop

359
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Stop

360
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Stop

361
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Stop

362
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Stop

363
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Stop

364
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Stop

365
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Stop

366
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Stop

367
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Stop

368
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
Stop

369
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,220
Stop

370
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
You know it

371
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Liar

372
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,220
I don't tell you

373
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
because I don't want you to get involved

374
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
I'm a slave of Eagle Division

375
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
but I'm still a son of Tang

376
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
I'm still the blood of Tang

377
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
How can I be free?

378
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
You follow me

379
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
to find out the route of Eagle Division

380
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
and pass it to Tang

381
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Right?

382
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Yes

383
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
Now I'm the leader of Tang

384
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
Even if I block Eagle Division

385
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,220
and other troops

386
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
even if I stop this time

387
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
there will be another time

388
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
But if you tell me to stay out of the way

389
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
you'd better kill me

390
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
I said

391
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
your life is mine

392
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Ashile Sun

393
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Eagle Division is living a good life on the grassland

394
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Why do you have to get involved?

395
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Later

396
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,220
later

397
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
you don't have to fight with Tang anymore

398
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,220
Except for Eagle Division

399
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:57,180
Great Khan has used a hundred thousand of the

400
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
I have a day

401
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
to be with you

402
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
Tie him up

403
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
and send him back to Eagle Division

404
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Yes

405
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm sorry, soldier

406
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Let's go

407
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Don't make it too difficult for me

408
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Luoyal

409
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Pass the order

410
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
and speed up the march

411
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
Yes

412
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,220
We won't move

413
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
We don't want the fight

414
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
Let's go

415
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,380
I'll go

416
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Please have something

417
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
There is someone

418
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Jr. Not well

419
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,120
Come on!

420
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
You come one!

421
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,700
I…

422
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,080
You bastard!

423
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,960
Take your hand back, whatever you got!

424
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,320
Give me a life lesson!

425
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,440
Another time I wanna toughen my throat

426
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,100
the more I got some school to teach

427
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,020
I'll do it carefully.

428
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,160
So my brother...

429
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,260
Lost.

430
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,580
Where is your effort towards me?

431
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,460
U pró

432
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,960
So useless.

433
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,480
Colorful!

434
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,660
like Qi Hengqiu.

435
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,340
Say it again.

436
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,700
I'm not a kid anymore.

437
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,860
I can at least protect my food.

438
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,780
Not like you.

439
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
You're always whining.

440
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,460
You don't know what you're afraid of.

441
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,020
If someone bullies you,

442
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,900
just beat them back.

443
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,460
I... I don't know how to hit people.

444
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,140
Just kick, grab, and beat them.

445
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,020
It's useless.

446
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,500
Where are you going?

447
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,620
Luoyang.

448
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,260
What about you?

449
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,820
I...

450
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,940
I don't know.

451
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,100
I don't care where I go.

452
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,580
What about your parents?

453
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,620
They...

454
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
They're dead.

455
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,420
I don't even remember

456
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,780
how they look like.

457
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,180
What?

458
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,980
You want to mess with me?

459
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,780
You?

460
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,100
You're not qualified.

461
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,480
Then,

462
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,840
what's the point of being in this world?

463
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
Why do you do this to me?

464
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,060
I'm no one to fight against you.

465
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,200
You say that

466
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,260
for your personal sake,

467
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,200
but you Adviser Wei

468
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,300
who has言之io行修,

469
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,400
I'mfront that about him

470
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,420
as a good acting.

471
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,420
Don't you know

472
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,740
if you're nice,

473
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
I respect your contestants.

474
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,780
Take Kites high.

475
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,300
Dr. Su, please break it off for me

476
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,760
I too am like Eagle Division

477
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,000
I need to protect my relatives and friends

478
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,140
No

479
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,900
Sun Deqing promised me

480
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,220
the eagle Division will be yours

481
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,580
Don't argue

482
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,300
Listen to me

483
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,480
If you let me go

484
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,040
tell him

485
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,900
tell him my class has run away

486
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,000
Suddenly you didn't think me out

487
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
he wouldn't blame you

488
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,760
Dr. Su

489
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,220
tell him

490
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Dr. Su

491
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,780
Dr. Su, think about it

492
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,460
I won't listen

493
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,980
You

494
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,220
You're good at talking

495
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,580
Dr. Su

496
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
I won't listen

497
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,780
Come closer

498
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,740
I won't listen

499
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,420
Take your hand down

500
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,100
I won't listen

501
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,060
Dr. Su, I'm hungry

502
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,740
I won't listen

503
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,220
Dr. Su, I'm hungry

504
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,340
I'm hungry

505
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,860
Eat

506
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,380
How can I eat it?

507
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Untie it for me

508
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,500
I'll eat it myself

509
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,620
No

510
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,220
I'll untie your rope

511
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,740
You'll run away

512
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,020
You think I'm stupid?

513
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,900
What if I'm hungry?

514
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,660
Well

515
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,060
I'll tear it open and feed you

516
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,940
Anyway

517
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,500
I can't understand

518
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
all the things you said

519
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,140
So

520
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,860
you don't have to

521
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,340
talk to me

522
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,700
I just know

523
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,140
you can't understand

524
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,620
I just know

525
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,620
listen to Sun Tegin

526
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,500
and prepare to do it

527
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,980
Eat

528
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,380
Have a rest

529
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,180
We have to

530
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,500
go tomorrow

531
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,900
Sorry, Dr. Su

532
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,100
I must go back and have a look

533
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,340
Your Majesty

534
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,940
Your Majesty

535
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,060
What happened?

536
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,220
The Eagle Division of Ashile Tribe

537
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,380
is good at military tactics

538
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,740
They used the army of Yuchi

539
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,740
to divide the troops

540
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,700
The Eagle Division is not good at it

541
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,860
They beat the army of Yuchi

542
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
so tired that they can't even

543
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,940
tell the difference

544
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,980
Their main force

545
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,820
can take advantage of the time to pass Jinyang

546
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,300
and arrive at Weishui

547
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,380
at sunset

548
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,860
I heard that the Eagle Division

549
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,260
is good at fighting

550
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,860
No wonder Yanli Khan

551
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,820
is good at martial arts

552
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,620
Song of Ten Wings

553
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,220
has put his hands

554
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,580
all over the circle

555
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,260
Now

556
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,820
the eagle division

557
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,660
of livable force

558
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,780
hasMusic

559
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,900
King

560
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,660
By the time I have completed individuals

561
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,240
tor crimson

562
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,020
will have a confirmed troops

563
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,940
What the hell if the collective force

564
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,220
is no more

565
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
than one hundred j anticipate

566
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,580
So down people

567
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,980
and government

568
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,220
Especially if the tail is clamped

569
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,420
Peace

570
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,880
Arrest him

571
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,220
It's strange.

572
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,700
Why didn't Hang Army

573
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,540
set off in Weishui?

574
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,220
It's only 40 miles from Chang'an.

575
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,220
The people there are three years old.

576
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,780
They know how to beg for mercy and escape.

577
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,500
I think

578
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,820
they're just running away from the city

579
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,220
and planning to surrender.

580
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,380
Then we should hurry up

581
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,260
and cross the river

582
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,060
before the Tang Dynasty is ready.

583
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,660
Then we can camp

584
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,100
in Chang'an tomorrow.

585
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,260
Sun, what do you think?

586
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,060
I don't want to camp here.

587
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,180
I don't want to waste my time.

588
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,900
I'd better be careful.

589
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,180
Report!

590
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,300
Report!

591
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,380
Report, Khan!

592
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,380
What are you doing?

593
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,820
Why are you back alone?

594
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,620
What's going on?

595
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,700
Shuhai.

596
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,660
The Ten-Heart Division

597
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
has been detained.

598
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,740
What?

599
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,020
I think they're looking for death.

600
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,620
If we don't capture Chang'an today,

601
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,460
Ashile Tribe will be in danger.

602
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,540
The two armies are fighting.

603
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,260
They won't be involved in the next battle.

604
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,820
The Tang Dynasty has detained the Ten-Heart Division.

605
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
There's something behind it.

606
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,340
Please think twice.

607
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,100
Pass my order.

608
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,820
The army should stop moving forward

609
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,180
and camp there.

610
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,020
Yes.

611
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,820
Stop moving forward and camp there.

612
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,940
Shuhai, why did you stop?

613
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,700
There's a trap.

614
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,820
Fang Yi?

615
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,060
Why is he here?

616
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,020
Little Prince,

617
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,820
stop him from好的 azure.

618
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
The army has already been deployed here.

619
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,820
We've been through a lot on the way.

620
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Are we going to retreat?

621
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Father, we haven't figured out the number of Tang army yet.

622
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
If we attack without permission,

623
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
I'm afraid it's a little different.

624
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
I agree.

625
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
I'm willing to lead the army to help Shu Han.

626
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Maybe we can take the opportunity to break through the Tang army.

627
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
But we can't rely on the Wolf Division.

628
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
We have to get the army out of the city.

629
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
We have to attack the Tang army.

630
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
But we can't rely on the Wolf Division.

631
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Sui, you go too.

632
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
Get the army and attack the Tang camp at night.

633
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,820
I want to see how great the Tang army is.

634
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,820
Yes.

635
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,820
The Wolf Division

636
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Changge should have returned to Eagle Division by now.

637
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Tegin.

638
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
Tegin.

639
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
Su Yishe.

640
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Why are you here?

641
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
I messed up the thing.

642
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
What happened to Changge?

643
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
She's fine.

644
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,820
The main thing is I accidentally got caught by her spy.

645
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,820
She just left for less than half a day.

646
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
I got caught in her trap.

647
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
She ran away.

648
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Forget it.

649
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,820
Su Yishe.

650
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
You go down and have a rest.

651
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,820
Come with me.

652
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Yes.

653
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,820
If you do anything bad to Tang,

654
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
I won't forgive you.

655
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,820
Ashile Sun.

656
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Don't force me to think about you one day.

657
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Tegin.

658
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Who's there?

659
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
Princess Yongning.

660
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Changge.

661
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
It's really you.

662
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Fang Yi.

663
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
Take her to the tent.

664
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Your Majesty.

665
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Fang Yi.

666
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
You can go down.

667
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Yes.

668
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
Go.

669
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,820
The news from Hao Du is that

670
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
you were killed in the grassland.

671
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
So I'm standing in front of you alive now.

672
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,820
You're very disappointed.

673
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,820
Since you left Chang'an,

674
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,820
I've been trying to find your whereabouts.

675
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
You don't know.

676
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,820
You don't know how much I worry about you.

677
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,820
You worry that I'm out there making trouble

678
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
and stop you from being a dragon.

679
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
So you want to find me

680
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
and get rid of me, right?

681
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
I was worried

682
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,820
that you would do something that would harm Tang.

683
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,820
But I've been waiting for you

684
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,820
to find out the news.

685
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
I'm afraid that

686
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
the news of misfortune will come.

687
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Hao Du sent a message back to the capital.

688
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
He said that you were killed in the grassland

689
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,820
to save the state of Shuozhou.

690
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,820
You know I...

691
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Okay.

692
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
It's good that you're alive.

693
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Changge.

694
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
Changge.

695
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Don't worry about Shuozhou.

696
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
I'll return what you want to you.

697
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Don't be so pretentious.

698
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Compared with Gongsun Ci,

699
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
compared with the people of Shuozhou,

700
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,820
what's the point of my suffering?

701
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
But you

702
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
are sitting in the Chang'an's den.

703
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
How much do you know about their suffering?

704
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
I know that Shuozhou is in danger.

705
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
I know that you and Gongsun Hang's sacrifice

706
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
is inevitable.

707
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Then why did you give up Shuozhou?

708
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
Why?

709
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
I've never given up

710
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,820
every inch of the land and every citizen of Tang.

711
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820
It's just that Shuozhou is isolated in the border.

712
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
When the second state is down,

713
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
the news of Shuozhou's failure

714
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,820
hasn't been spread.

715
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
When I know it,

716
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
I'll be late.

717
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
If you knew that Shuozhou was being attacked earlier,

718
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
you wouldn't have come close to the military.

719
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
After all, Shuozhou is in your eyes

720
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,820
is just a terrible border.

721
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,820
You're right.

722
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
Even if I knew that Shuozhou was being attacked,

723
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
I couldn't have lost too much military power

724
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
and moved to the old place.

725
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
You're still so cold-blooded.

726
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
I've taught you

727
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
to be strong and weak.

728
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
Do you remember?

729
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
When you're not as strong as others,

730
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,820
you can only be a little bit stronger.

731
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,820
Now Tang is in power,

732
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
and military power is in vain.

733
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
The most important thing is to be strong.

734
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,820
To be strong is to be able to

735
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,820
distinguish the roads and the borders.

736
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
When I make a mistake,

737
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
he can enter the border.

738
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
Although I'm not in the top position,

739
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
I didn't expect that Tianjie Army

740
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
would be defeated by the rebellion in Jingzhou.

741
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
He's been caught.

742
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,820
What are you talking about?

743
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
Now Tang's army has been in the top position

744
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,820
several times in Ashile Army.

745
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
What are you talking about?

746
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
How could this be?

747
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Why are the differences in military power

748
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
between the two sides so big?

749
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
The number of soldiers in Chang'an

750
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,820
is only 40,000.

751
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Now they're all in Wei Shui County.

752
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,820
The army camps behind them

753
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
are all empty.

754
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,820
There's no Chang'an City

755
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,820
to rely on.

756
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,820
The army camps

757
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,820
are all empty.

758
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
The army camps are all empty.

759
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,820
The army camps are all empty.

760
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
They can rely on us.

761
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
The army is fake.

762
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
The people in the army are fake too.

763
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
You're talking about the empty city?

764
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,820
At present,

765
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,820
Ashile Army is temporarily caught.

766
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
Are you crazy?

767
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
Once the soldiers know that

768
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
there's no hope behind them,

769
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
the military will be shaken.

770
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,820
The consequences will be unimaginable.

771
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,820
How could you?

772
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,820
So I have to be here.

773
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
When necessary,

774
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
I will show my identity

775
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
to the military.

776
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
But with this military power,

777
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,820
how can we stop Ashile Army

778
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
and protect the Tang Dynasty?

779
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
Changge,

780
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
I've taught you a lesson.

781
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,820
Know your enemy, but don't do anything.

782
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Follow the people,

783
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
and you'll be fine.

784
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Yanxi!

785
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
Yanxi!

786
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
Your Majesty,

787
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,820
Ashile Army suddenly came.

788
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
Your Majesty.

789
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
You're still alive.

790
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
Shuyu,

791
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,820
you're just in time.

792
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,820
Escort Changge out of here.

793
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
Fang Yi, prepare the horse.

794
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,820
Your Majesty, the horse is ready.

795
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
I'll escort you out immediately.

796
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
No.

797
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
Follow me to the formation.

798
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
To meet Ashile Army.

799
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
You're going to the formation in person?

800
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
Yes.

801
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
Order the three armies

802
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
to raise the dragon flag high

803
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
and light the torches.

804
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Make sure Ashile Army knows

805
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
that I fought with them.

806
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Yes.

807
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
If the emperor of Tang Dynasty

808
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
is attacked in front of me,

809
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
then the Tang Dynasty will be in trouble.

810
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
This is the time to defeat the King of the Village.

811
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,820
If the Tang Army is weak in defense,

812
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
it will reveal the truth immediately.

813
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
I must show up,

814
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
so that Ashile Army will believe

815
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,820
that the Tang Army is sure to win.

816
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Don't worry.

817
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
I'm very lucky.

818
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
Shuyu,

819
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
make sure you escort Changge

820
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
to a safe place.

821
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,820
Yes.

822
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
Stop.

823
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Your Majesty.

824
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,820
Your Majesty.

825
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,820
Your Majesty, please don't.

826
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
Don't.

827
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,820
You're getting on my nerves.

828
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Let go of my hand.

829
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,820
Your Majesty.

830
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
Your Majesty.

831
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,820
The situation is under control.

832
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,820
Please think about another way.

833
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
I'm the emperor of Tang Dynasty,

834
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
and I'm also a citizen of Tang Dynasty.

835
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
It's my duty to protect my country

836
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
and protect it.

837
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
The war situation is critical.

838
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
I must go to the front of the battle

839
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
so that I can be a good commander

840
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
and save the lives of the casualties.

841
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,820
I've never been afraid of the enemy.

842
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Now I'm in a deep solitude

843
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,820
and I'm determined to win.

844
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
It's more terrifying

845
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,820
to see me go to the front of the battle.

846
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
I'll take them back

847
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
in this round.

848
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,820
Please take care of the official affairs.

849
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Let go of my hand.

850
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Your Majesty.

851
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Go.

852
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
Your Majesty.

853
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Your Majesty.

854
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,820
Your Majesty, be careful.

855
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
Go.

856
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Kill.

857
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
Kill.

858
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,820
Kill.

859
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
Kill.

860
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Kill.

861
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
Kill.

862
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
Kill.

863
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Kill.

864
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Kill.

865
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Kill.

866
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
Kill.

867
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Kill.

868
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
Kill.

869
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Kill.

870
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
Kill.

871
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Kill.

872
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,820
Kill.

873
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
Kill.

874
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Kill.

875
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,820
Kill.

876
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,820
Kill.

877
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,820
Kill.

878
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Kill.

879
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Kill.

880
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,820
Kill.

881
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,820
Kill.

882
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,820
Kill.

883
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,820
Kill.

884
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
Kill.

885
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
Kill.

886
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Kill.

887
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Kill.

888
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
Kill.

889
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,820
Kill.

890
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Kill.

891
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Let me go, Wei Shuyu!

892
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,820
No matter what,

893
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,820
I will not let you disappear again.

894
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,820
Do you think you can control me?

895
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
Even if I use my best effort,

896
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,820
I cannot let you go into danger again.

897
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
You're really ridiculous.

898
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
Who's the person who kept you in danger

899
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,820
all this time?

900
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,420
You haven't changed at all.

901
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,780
You're still a self-righteous young man

902
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,220
like before.

903
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,820
I know you don't believe

904
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,820
what I say.

905
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,180
But you saw His Majesty today.

906
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,820
You know he didn't want to kill you.

907
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,060
It's not too late.

908
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,620
Come back to Chang'an with us.

909
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,660
Enough.

910
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,060
Since the day I was killed by the Eastern Palace,

911
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,380
nothing can go back to the past.

912
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,580
We're not like before.

913
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,100
There's no need to say more.

914
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,700
I don't need your care.

915
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,300
You were

916
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,100
and you are now.

917
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Changge.

918
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,500
Changge, there's a battle outside.

919
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Where are you going?

920
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,900
It's none of your business.

921
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,900
Move.

922
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Look, Khan.

923
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,100
That's Li Xinmin.

924
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,300
Tang Huang is at the scene.

925
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,100
There must be something wrong.

926
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Could it be...

927
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,700
Tang will win!

928
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Tang will win!

929
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Tang will win!

930
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,700
Tang will win!

931
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Tang will win!

932
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
Tang will win!

933
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,300
Tang will win!

934
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Tang will win!

935
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,500
Tang will win!

936
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,300
Tang will win!

937
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,500
Tang will win!

938
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Go.

939
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Ge Han, come here.

940
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Aren't you going forward?

941
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Li Shimin, don't be too kind.

942
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Who is too kind?

943
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Back then, Ashile Tribe and our Tang Dynasty

944
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
promised to be brothers.

945
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,700
But Ge Han was deceived by his own family

946
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
and was led into the camp.

947
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Is this how you treat your brothers?

948
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,700
I am here

949
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
to tell Ge Han

950
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
that I don't practice war

951
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,700
but I don't fear war.

952
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
Hundreds of thousands of lives

953
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,700
are gathered here to fight for water.

954
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
I don't want to see

955
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
the blood of the warriors of both sides being fed by water.

956
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
I don't want to see the grasslands

957
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
being filled with poison.

958
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
The grasslands

959
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
are fighting for their faith.

960
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,700
I don't fear death.

961
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
If you insist on fighting,

962
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
tonight,

963
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
I will take my soldiers

964
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
to fight.

965
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I don't want to see the grasslands

00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,700
we can become

1020
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,700
eternal.

1023
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
between us

1024
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,700
is endless.
