1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The dream is a pair of hearts that are boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is a frosty city

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Forget you

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will give you the look of a stubborn old man

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to him and make him long for me

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After the life, do not forget the madness

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Quickly gather the Bear Division

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hurry up

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But Mu Jin found me

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is given by Mu Jin

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Go up

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hurry up

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do not stop Great Khan from suppressing me

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But Tegin

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If it is really Great Khan's benefit

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We are now sending troops

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Will it be a mess of Great Khan's plan

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm afraid

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Afraid of what

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are not sending troops now

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You will always be trampled by Eagle Division

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry up

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Gather the Bear Division

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Tegin

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you laughing at

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Enough, right

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I laugh at the Bear Division in the Ming Dynasty

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tegin is actually a coward

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Tegin, you will strangle him

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I just want to strangle him

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tegin

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Tegin

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Tegin

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tegin

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tegin

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tegin

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tegin

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tegin

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Tegin

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tegin

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You killed me

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And right now

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We lost the last chance to take down Eagle Division

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you know this

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can you only press ж

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say what you want

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do not interfere with Tegin's time

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Guarded city's Commandant Li was my brother

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Gringo

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm the best guard

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Still give things to Tegin

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How much do you know

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To my brother

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know at least half of Shuozhou City

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,880
I'll be half of Shuozhou City.

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,880
You've never lied to me.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,640
If I'm not worth it,

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
you can kill me anytime.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,640
Let's meet in the city.

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,960
I just got the news.

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Tu Kasui and Yi Bukan

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,920
are taking a man from Zhongyuan to Shuozhou City.

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
We have to go there as soon as possible.

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
We have to catch them before they're stupid.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,320
Otherwise, all the trouble will be wasted.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
Get the clothes for the special forces.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
Yes.

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,080
Commandant Li, the people from the Bear Division are here.

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Why are they still here?

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
There are not many people.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
But it's strange that there's a Zhongyuan man.

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes!

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,800
Your Excellency.

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,160
A'Dou.

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,120
A'Dou.

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,200
Fu Hua.

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,800
Let them open the gate.

87
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
I said,

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,640
let them open the gate.

89
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,720
I said,

90
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
let them open the gate.

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,240
If you dare to touch him again,

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll break your bones.

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,840
Li Da.

94
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,040
As long as you open the gate

95
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
and come out to talk to us,

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
I'll let him go.

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,520
Otherwise,

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
I'll beat him to death

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,560
in front of you.

100
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,520
Li Duwei.

101
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,400
Let me go.

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
Let me go.

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
The people of the tribe are too close to the gate.

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
Even if the gate is only open one line,

105
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
they can't break in.

106
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
It's better than not seeing the sun.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, Li Duwei.

108
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,440
You beast.

109
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Hit him.

110
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
I...

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,520
It's in my blood.

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
General.

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,600
A'Dou.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Wait.

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,400
I'll come and save you.

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,160
Commandant Li.

118
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,040
Commandant Li.

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,800
No.

120
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,440
Let go.

121
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,040
No.

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,640
Commandant Li.

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,640
Commandant Li.

124
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,120
Let go.

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,200
I can't let A'Dou go alone.

126
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,040
It's a danger to Shuozhou.

127
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,440
I...

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
I...

129
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I want to be

130
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,440
a general.

131
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
A'Dou seems to be saying something.

132
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,240
I...

133
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
I want to be...

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
I want to be a general.

135
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,560
A'Dou is kneeling.

136
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
He's not asking us to open the gate and save him.

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,080
He's saying...

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
Feet are gone.

139
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,680
It sandwiched.

140
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,840
The sand between my fingersÿ

141
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,960
I toot to him manufacturing.

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,240
It's gone forever.

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,840
The séances.

144
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Yun Shang.

145
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
A'Dou.

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
Have you forgotten ?

147
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,600
Have you forgotten ?

148
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,920
What is left of me ?

149
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,760
Don't be silly, A'Dou.

150
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,400
Get up.

151
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,800
Get up.

152
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
Get up, A'Dou.

153
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,160
Master.

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,400
I can finally be a general.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
I can finally be your subordinate.

156
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,040
A'Dou.

157
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,240
You'll be a general when you grow up.

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I'll take you away.

159
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,480
You can't die here, A'Dou.

160
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,480
I'll take you away.

161
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
A'Dou.

162
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,040
Master.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,120
I can do it.

164
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,480
I can do it.

165
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
No, A'Dou.

166
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
No.

167
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
A'Dou.

168
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,080
Get up.

169
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,720
The death of Dai Zhou is not a fate.

170
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,520
You liar.

171
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,800
I'll kill you.

172
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,560
A'Dou.

173
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,720
A'Dou.

174
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
A'Dou.

175
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,040
A'Dou.

176
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
A'Dou.

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Didn't you say there's no Yan?

178
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,840
The people who came here

179
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,480
are the Ashile people disguised as Yuan's family.

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,920
The Qi's army

181
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
is full of soldiers.

182
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,520
We can't let these Ashile people

183
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,200
get close to Shuozhou.

184
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600
Commandant Ning.

185
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,640
Chu Qi Yu.

186
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,560
Hurry.

187
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,600
Hurry.

188
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,880
Take command of Li Dongwei.

189
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,720
Hurry.

190
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,200
Chu Qi.

191
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,360
Ashile's death is a plan.

192
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,440
The whole army is shouting.

193
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,560
What should we do?

194
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,120
We'd better fight them in the city.

195
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
You killed the most useful hostage.

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,600
You're good at it.

197
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,360
Attack.

198
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,800
Why do you need to attack?

199
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Back up.

200
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Let them come.

201
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,200
Go.

202
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,160
Back up.

203
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
ъ

204
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
Stop.

205
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
Shuozhou.

206
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,200
Enough.

207
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,920
Jiaxia.

208
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,880
Go!

209
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,720
Your Highness,

210
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,040
General Whip really did well.

211
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,480
He sure did.

212
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,560
Get back!

213
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,400
The деся That's a target

214
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
It's my death sentence.

215
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,640
Lan Mu Nian.

216
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,080
Si Wen.

217
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,640
They all held grudges.

218
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,800
It's not good for us to continue like this.

219
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,120
This strike

220
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
is for A'Dou.

221
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,720
Don't kill me.

222
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,280
This is for the people of Shuozhou!

223
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
We'll win if we're defeated.

224
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,360
Tu Kashe has already made us lose our chance.

225
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,960
Let's withdraw.

226
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Tu Kashe

227
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,240
Let's go!

228
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
The last one

229
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,640
is a soldier who died in the battle!

230
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,880
It's none of my business.

231
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,120
No, don't kill me!

232
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Tu Kashe

233
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Tu Kashe

234
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Tu Kashe

235
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Tu Kashe

236
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
Although I don't know who you are,

237
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,040
you're definitely not a coward.

238
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I've been living a lonely life.

239
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm afraid no one knows when I'll die in the haze.

240
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,720
If I can fight with you,

241
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,320
it's worth it even if I die.

242
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
Master, you're my future.

243
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
I'll follow you no matter I'm dead or alive.

244
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Since you want to be a teacher,

245
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,520
you should have a formal gift.

246
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
From now on, you're my disciple.

247
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,920
We're both going to be together from now on.

248
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
When I come back from Lile Palace,

249
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,320
you'll all have to call me General Dou.

250
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I'm going to be a general.

251
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Welcome General Dou to the election!

252
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Welcome General Dou to the election!

253
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Tu Kashe

254
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Tu Kashe

255
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Tu Kashe

256
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Tu Kashe

257
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Welcome General Dou to the election!

258
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Tu Kashe

259
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Tu Kashe

260
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Give this letter to Ashile Sun.

261
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Master, now that the two armies are at war,

262
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Ashile Sun is still the enemy's special envoy.

263
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Why do you want to write this letter?

264
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
What?

265
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Are you afraid that I'll be a accomplice?

266
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
I dare not.

267
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm just kidding.

268
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
You've been with me for so many years.

269
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
I've never done anything that I'm not sure of.

270
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I've thought of a plan.

271
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
It's all in my hands.

272
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Just send this letter to him.

273
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Yes.

274
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Master.

275
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Master, I have a plan.

276
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Tell me.

277
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Master, the fire in the north will start in July.

278
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
We can retreat in Yangzhuang

279
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
and let Ying Shi take over the city of Shuozhou.

280
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
We can set up firewood in the city.

281
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
When Ashile Sun's army enters the city,

282
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
we'll set the fire and use the north wind

283
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
to burn them to the ground.

284
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,320
If Ashile Sun's army continues to besiege the city,

285
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,320
the food in the city will only be enough for three days' food.

286
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
But if you do it,

287
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
it will be a huge loss.

288
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
The whole people of Shuozhou will be left to die.

289
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Commandant Li,

290
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
do you think the price of the latter two men

291
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
is more worth it?

292
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
I...

293
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Why do you think

294
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
I want to defend Shuozhou?

295
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
I want to defend

296
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
not a military fortress,

297
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
but the city of Shuozhou

298
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
where all the tigers live and live.

299
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
If not,

300
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,360
I wouldn't have

301
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,320
destroyed the Li Tang

302
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
after the Jinyang Li Tang was destroyed.

303
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
In fact, now I think

304
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
war or destruction

305
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
are just means.

306
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
The people's safety

307
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
and not being attacked by war

308
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
are the most important.

309
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
These

310
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
are the things I hold on to.

311
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Zishui,

312
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
are you

313
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,320
going to surrender to Ashile Tribe?

314
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
A'Du and those soldiers who died in the battle,

315
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
did they die in vain?

316
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Commandant Li,

317
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
don't be so excited.

318
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm just

319
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
giving an example.

320
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

321
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
All right, Commandant Li.

322
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
It's late.

323
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm sure

324
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
about the retreat.

325
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
We'll discuss the rest tomorrow.

326
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Yes.

327
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
You really dared to come here.

328
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I really admire you.

329
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I've always been the son of

330
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng.

331
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
If you asked me to come,

332
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I wouldn't have ambushed the snake street.

333
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Besides,

334
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
aren't you the same?

335
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
I wonder

336
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
what you want to discuss with me.

337
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Just be frank.

338
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm not going to

339
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
ask you to come.

340
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm just going to

341
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
ask you to come.

342
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
If Shuozhou is the county,

343
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
can you promise

344
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
not to hurt the lives of the people in the city?

345
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
If I

346
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
use the city of Fen,

347
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
I wouldn't expect

348
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Eagle Division to return to the capital with me.

349
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
But by then,

350
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
you can only

351
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
get the ashes of Shuozhou.

352
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I think

353
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
this is not the result

354
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
that the special forces want.

355
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
If you want to do this,

356
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
you won't be delayed.

357
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
You won't put yourself in danger.

358
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
This is not a threat.

359
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
This is a request.

360
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I'm curious

361
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
why you would

362
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
ask me this question.

363
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I've led the army to attack the city for many days.

364
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Shuozhou's army is heavily injured.

365
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
In your eyes,

366
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Ashile Sun is the kind of person

367
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
who is soft-hearted.

368
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
When the Eagle Division

369
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
burned the granary,

370
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
we could have burned down

371
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
the surrounding houses.

372
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
By then,

373
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
I could only save people.

374
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
But you didn't do that.

375
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
You just kept me alive.

376
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
You only asked me

377
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
to come quickly.

378
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
This shows that

379
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
you don't want to kill people without a reason.

380
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
You've led the Eagle Division

381
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
to fight in many places.

382
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I've heard about

383
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
your actions

384
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
and behaviors.

385
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I believe

386
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
you have the ability

387
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
and the will

388
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
to save their lives.

389
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
But

390
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I've fought Ashile Tribe

391
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
many times

392
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
over the years.

393
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Ashile Tribe

394
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
has a deep grudge

395
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
against me and Shuozhou.

396
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Now,

397
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
since we're going to present the city,

398
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
I should be honest.

399
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
I'll present a gift

400
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
that will make Ashile's army

401
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
and all the soldiers

402
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
satisfied and relieved.

403
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
I won't make Teginni

404
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
feel embarrassed.

405
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
I'm serious.

406
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Have you thought it through?

407
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Is it really worth

408
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
all the effort?

409
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
There are things

410
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
that can't be done.

411
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
It's just a gift.

412
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Compared to the safety

413
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
of the people of Shuozhou,

414
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
it's nothing.

415
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I

416
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
don't regret it.

417
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
I finally know

418
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
how Gongsun Heng

419
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
came to the city of Humin Guan.

420
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Don't worry.

421
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I'll keep my word

422
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
about what you said.

423
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I'll keep my word.

424
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Okay.

425
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Then,

426
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
I'll write a letter

427
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
for the people of Shuozhou.

428
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Brilliant.

429
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
It's been many time

430
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,560
It's all because of you

431
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
that the people of Shuzhou

432
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,040
can live and die

433
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
and unite to collect the money

434
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,960
The war is fierce

435
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
We must do our best

436
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,680
to comfort all the soldiers

437
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,640
When the time comes

438
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,560
we need to send more people to Chang'an

439
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,400
to inform the situation of Shuzhou

440
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,440
and ask for help

441
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,840
Shuozhou has been collecting money for years

442
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,240
Now the warehouse is burned

443
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,440
and the field is destroyed

444
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,240
It's even worse

445
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,600
How to survive the winter festival?

446
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,240
How will the people's livelihood be in the coming year?

447
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,200
You need to think about it

448
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
In the future, Shuozhou will be in trouble

449
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,600
We need to think about it

450
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,000
Here

451
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,240
I thank you

452
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,040
on behalf of the people of Shuozhou

453
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,760
You are right

454
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,840
It's our duty

455
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to impeach Xie Zi

456
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,800
Xie Zi

457
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,560
is the people of Shuozhou

458
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,000
Thank you for your kind words

459
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,760
Li Duwei

460
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:32,440
It's hard to get rid of the

461
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,320
Come

462
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,720
It's really your cooking

463
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
It's the best

464
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's rare

465
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,880
If you like it, you can drink more

466
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,480
It's a family dinner

467
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
You don't need to stay here

468
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Yuan'er

469
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Be good

470
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,840
Put down the wooden sword

471
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,560
We can play after dinner

472
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Okay

473
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,280
Yuan'er got the small wooden sword

474
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,640
She doesn't want to let go

475
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,920
I asked her why

476
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
She said she wanted to be like

477
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,840
Li, Dou and dad

478
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,160
She wants to protect the people

479
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,240
and do good deeds

480
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,760
like dad

481
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,680
I need to grow up soon

482
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
When I grow up

483
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I will be with Li

484
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
to help him

485
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,120
That's great

486
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,960
Yuan'er

487
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,560
Thank Li

488
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,880
If you really want to

489
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,160
learn martial arts and help him

490
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,560
If one day

491
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,680
dad is not with you

492
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,400
you can protect yourself

493
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,880
It's not the bad people's humiliation

494
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Why is dad not here?

495
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,240
Silly girl

496
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,920
You won't marry anyone in your life?

497
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,520
You will stay by dad's side

498
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,760
and be an old lady?

499
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,680
Madam

500
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,080
I want to propose a toast to you

501
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,680
All these years

502
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,160
I have been in the front line

503
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
I want to thank you

504
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,600
for helping me to be the rear guard

505
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
to take care of the wounded

506
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,080
and help me to help the people

507
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,720
and help the people

508
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,280
It's all on you

509
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,080
Even our Yuan'er

510
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,880
is all because of you

511
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,840
to take care of the education

512
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,520
I really don't know

513
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
how to repay you

514
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,120
Father

515
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,000
I can't please you

516
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,920
We worlds be squared

517
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,240
ショ و samen

518
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,080
I will follow your steps

519
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,280
and follow you to the end.

520
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,800
My lady,

521
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,920
you should take care of yourself.

522
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,440
Now that the autumn festival is over,

523
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
you should take care of yourself.

524
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,320
Otherwise, when winter comes,

525
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,600
you will have to

526
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,080
keep cold and cold.

527
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,360
It's hard to sleep.

528
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,480
You don't have to worry about me.

529
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,840
Winter festival is hard to get,

530
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,600
but there will be spring back.

531
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,320
Spring hurts me deeply…

532
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,120
River Yun.

533
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,760
River Yun is by the genau that

534
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
across the great river on the Song River river.

535
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,560
We are supposed to principle

536
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,640
the sentence at the spring festival

537
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,200
and call the escaped element here.

538
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,960
But since I was awake,

539
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,600
the blood wine

540
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,720
the spring wine

541
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,360
Don't worry about me.

542
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,920
I will take care of her

543
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,520
and will be sure to get the��

544
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Uncleity igualizes to virtue.

545
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,680
Here.

546
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,340
Adviser,

547
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,440
the quieres mirror me down here,

548
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,280
is there anything else to gospel?

549
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,340
Who is it?

550
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,840
dangers within.

551
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,780
Who is it?

552
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,460
Could it be Kidnapping of the evil spirits,

553
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,720
or a ghost with 20 years of mortality?

554
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,520
I will tell you

555
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,240
Commandant Li

556
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,800
Please sit

557
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,240
Please

558
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,720
This is the map of Shuozhou

559
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,920
All the inventory

560
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,400
The size of the warehouse and the inventory

561
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,360
All have clear descriptions

562
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,200
And this commandant's tally

563
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,080
With it

564
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,840
You can mobilize the guards of Shuozhou

565
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
And the staff of my governor's office

566
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,240
Why did the governor give me these?

567
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,880
The guards of Shuozhou all obeyed the commander's order

568
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Why did you hand over the tally today?

569
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,560
The guards of Shuozhou are only under the order of the governor

570
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,760
That's because

571
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,160
I am here

572
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,480
What do you mean by this?

573
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,640
I have decided

574
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,120
The opening of the city tomorrow

575
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,120
Ashile Sun has promised me

576
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,480
He will save the lives of the people

577
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,200
What about the price?

578
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,880
What is the price?

579
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,680
The price

580
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,920
The price is to

581
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,200
wear my headdress

582
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,840
Governor

583
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,640
Please give me some more time

584
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,840
I will think of a perfect plan

585
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,400
This is already a perfect plan

586
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,080
Governor

587
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,480
Ashile has never occupied Shuozhou for so many years

588
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,280
So as the guard of Shuozhou

589
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
As long as I am here

590
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,000
Even if they occupy the last person

591
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,440
I will never surrender

592
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,600
But Ashile's tribe

593
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,880
I have guarded the border for many years

594
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,920
Their Khan has suffered countless defeats

595
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,000
But I have long hated him

596
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,960
Now I have to give him my phone

597
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,240
To get rid of his doubts and grudges

598
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,880
Only in this way

599
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,840
Can I exchange the lives of the people in the city

600
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,800
No

601
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,800
I disagree

602
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,520
There must be other ways

603
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,200
To give the lives of the people in Shuozhou

604
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,760
To the princess of Tang

605
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,440
With all the people's will

606
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,760
For me

607
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,120
It's also a good choice

608
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,320
Princess Yongning is smart and smart

609
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,400
There are still a lot of things to do in the future

610
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,080
There is still a long way to go

611
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,800
You can't give up here

612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,480
You know who I am

613
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,000
The person who chased you that day

614
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,200
He called you Princess Yongning

615
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,360
Princess Yongning

616
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,520
Do you have any last words?

617
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,000
He had fought with me

618
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,400
From his martial arts

619
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,040
I think he must be the guard in the palace

620
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,480
Chased you to Shuozhou

621
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,400
But he didn't have a public statement

622
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,760
Except the former crown prince's old ministry

623
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,960
Who else can it be?

624
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,720
Actually

625
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
For me

626
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
It doesn't matter who you are

627
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,240
Since the first time

628
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,360
You saved my wife and Yuan'er

629
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,360
I know you are not a lowly person

630
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,000
No matter what your purpose was to me at the beginning

631
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,920
But I can be sure

632
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,680
You have no bad intentions to me and Shuozhou

633
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,520
So I am willing to keep you by my side

634
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,840
It's a pity

635
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,440
I can't wait to see you

636
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,440
The day you realize your dream

637
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,280
At this time

638
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,280
My name is Li Changge

639
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,760
The crown prince Li Jiancheng's daughter

640
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
Has long been not Princess Yongning

641
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,400
Now I just want to fight against the emperor with the crown prince

642
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,040
Please take back the crown prince's order

643
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,960
Changge must do his best to protect Shuozhou

644
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,040
Princess

645
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,480
Princess, you can't do this

646
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,040
Princess

647
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,400
I am loyal to the emperor all my life

648
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,280
At this moment

649
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,760
I can't do anything wrong

650
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,000
Now I should kneel down

651
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,480
Princess

652
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,760
You are so kind to the people of Shuozhou

653
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,920
Please accept my bow

654
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,840
Minister

655
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,240
Minister, please get up

656
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
I know how to protect Changge

657
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Please get up

658
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,800
Please get up

659
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,720
Princess

660
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,040
I have one more thing to ask

661
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,360
I have one more thing to ask

662
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Now

663
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,400
I can't let go of this matter

664
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,800
My daughter hasn't grown up yet

665
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,960
I know

666
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,560
After I was born

667
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,840
My wife wouldn't call her again

668
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,400
So I want to beg you

669
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,960
To take care of their mother and daughter

670
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,000
In the most possible situation

671
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,920
Here

672
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,400
I thank you for their mother and daughter

673
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,680
Minister

674
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,520
You should see your daughter grow up

675
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,120
Minister

676
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,280
Please take back the order

677
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,240
Please take back the order, minister

678
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,280
Yes

679
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:08,440
Inter deutsch uneasy

680
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,880
This is the order

681
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,520
Dad

682
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,840
I willالappоны let her go

683
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,720
Fou

684
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,760
Yes

685
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,960
Your Highness

686
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,240
Your Majesty

687
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,000
Gradually, I respond, gradually, I wake up

688
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,400
Gradually, I think of you

689
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Before saying goodbye, I hope

690
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I'll remember your figure

691
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Locked in my tender dream

692
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Before dawn, between the years

693
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,400
The longing flows

694
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,400
There is always a moment

695
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Burn the wastelands in my heart

696
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,400
There is always a longing

697
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Between you and me, everything is clear

698
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,400
In different worlds, in different worlds

699
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,400
I miss you so much

700
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,400
The deep thoughts that are like that

701
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Became eternity, the cocoon in the sky

702
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,400
There is always a moment

703
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Burn the wastelands in my heart

704
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,400
There is always a longing

705
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Between you and me, everything is clear

706
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,400
In different worlds, in different worlds

707
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I miss you so much

708
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,400
The deep thoughts that are like that

709
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Became eternity, the cocoon in the sky

710
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Inevitable
