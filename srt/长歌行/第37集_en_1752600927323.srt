1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am stubborn

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the hope of the past

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Climbing the river of life and the light of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I came to Mobei to find the purple grass

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Because Eagle Division has already been infected with the plague

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But the tooth shop has blocked all the purple grass channels

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What does this mean?

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It means that the tooth shop has abandoned Eagle Division

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What we are going to do now is to form an alliance

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What does this have to do with us?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That person just now

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He clearly saw me and recognized me

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But why didn't he act?

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Because he saw the leader of Mo Nan Mobei

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Gathered with Eagle Division's military strategist

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think he already thinks that the desert has colluded with Eagle Division

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If he goes back

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It will be the end of the desert

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
As long as we tie you up

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Give it to the messenger to take to the tooth shop

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can prove your innocence

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ok

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then tie me up

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
With your mother and daughter

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ata

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What did you say?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Kill him

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Stop

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You want to stop me?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is Mobei

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not your turn to talk here

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Move away

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Commander

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have brought his body back

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go get rid of the body

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't let me see it again

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The messenger is dead

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can't hide it

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's because of you

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Because of me?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Without me

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The desert will not be forced to be stoned

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Without me

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Zhen Zhu and your mother

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Won't you send to the tooth shop as hostages?

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Without me

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Will the tooth shop let you go?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't say it's you

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Eagle Division was born and died for the tooth shop

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Loyal and ungrateful

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Loyal and ungrateful

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What's the result now?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't say it

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Everything is a dead end

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Dujia, let's go home

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ata

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Who said there is only one dead end?

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Didn't I just say

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We can cooperate

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are so mean

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You haven't tried it

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How do you know?

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please let my people out of the city

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
As long as Eagle Division gets the purple grass

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And can be protected

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then I will convince Ashile Sun

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let Eagle Division cooperate with the desert

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What if you lie to us?

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then I will stay

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And tell you the rules of the tooth shop

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Please let my people out of the city

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Changge asked to be a hostage

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Can't come out

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will send you off for her

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The purple grass you want is loaded

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She asked you to take the team and send the purple grass back to Eagle Division

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Me?

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Why can't you?

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She believes you can

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Doesn't your grandma believe in herself?

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And they help you

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But Changge put herself here as a hostage

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't rest assured

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is her promise to the King of Mobei

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now the tooth shop has forced the Mobei and Mo Nan to fight

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And take us there as hostages

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's so annoying

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ata and the King of Mobei have already decided to resist

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now the priority is to persuade Eagle Division to cooperate

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To resist the tooth shop

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So Changge can be safe

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So you have to bring the news back

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Miss Mi

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Since the young master has made arrangements

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then we have to be on time

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We will leave the city immediately

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Child, goodbye

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't worry

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm right

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They will leave the desert smoothly

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can say it

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How to resist Ashile

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't endure it anymore

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't fight inside

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You Mo Nan and Mobei are the biggest tribe in the desert

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
As long as you join together

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't have to fear Ashile

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let me cooperate with her

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Impossible

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now it's not a one-off

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How can we fight together?

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you didn't want to cooperate at the beginning

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You wouldn't have rushed out to catch that messenger

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What if Mobei is willing to return your ancestral land?

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I didn't say that

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's too late now

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The old grudge can only be fought together in the future

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Have you ever thought about the consequences of failure?

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have never thought about the victory or defeat

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I suddenly regret it

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
At least you have to endure it

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We can still live in the whole Mo Nan

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Zhen Zhu once told me

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Her Atta is the bravest person in the world

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My Atta is a warrior who has no victory or defeat

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How can he be afraid of Ashile?

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
At that time, we will bring our bravest warrior

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
To conquer his royal court

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Please come down

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Am I right, Atta?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Just say the truth

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's already like this

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You can't even protect your own family

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you still have to endure it?

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Enduring it can't avoid conflict

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The war has already burned down the door of the house

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you still have to continue to do this?

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Mo Nan's ancestral place

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Give it back to you

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mo Nan has 20,000 soldiers now

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How about you?

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Less than 30,000

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Not only

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We have to fight for more allies

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The whole desert is united

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
More than 50,000 soldiers

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Princess

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's up?

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mobei Mo Nan is rebelling

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
A'Dong was killed

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Send someone to keep an eye on Li Changge's people

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
To spread the news

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The people of Eagle Division got the grass

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mobei also sent a group of people

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
To drive back Eagle Division

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Li Changge

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How could he let Mobei and Mo Nan work together?

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It seems that Eagle Division is in a closed defense

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I should have killed Li Changge

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
By the way

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When will Sher and Tu Kashe come back?

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
According to your order

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
By the order of Great Khan

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The Bear Division and Wolf Division are transferred to the border

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's time to come back

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Call the Bear Division back to the government immediately

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
By the way

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's time to send Mimi Guli to the field

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's so late

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Where is the princess?

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm still a little worried

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Before Sher and Tu Kashe come back

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I have to make sure that Yan Li can't talk

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sorry

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Water

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Help

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Water

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why is it you?

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Where is Jinse?

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I haven't seen him for a long time

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You won't see him again in the future

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What's wrong with him?

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Dead

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's you

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In the future, the people around Khan

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Only me

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What do you want to do?

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Khan once said

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Will seek justice for me and Sui

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Still make a mistake

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's because of your promise

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I will stand up and walk

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Solved the problem for you

214
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Otherwise

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What do you think of the current situation?

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How did it come

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's all your own decision

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You killed my brother

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
With me

220
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No relationship

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The truth is how

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Who cares

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The important thing is

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The person sitting in this position now

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But you

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ashile Chobi

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You think

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Since Khan is now seriously ill

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Then I will do for Khan

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Do what you should do

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You want to kill me

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just like the child killed my brother

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ashile

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Is

235
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Won't let you go

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You don't have to worry about this

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Eagle Division and Bear Division

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have my own way to deal with it

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wolf Division

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You want to support the snake

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He is a young and uneducated kid

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ashile tribe

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Won't support him

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Just because of this

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So I won't kill you

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I want to keep you

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Give me a good failure

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I want to tell aunt

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let her see her child

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What kind of devil is this

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I advise you not to struggle

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The more you inhale

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The more you will be poisoned

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The more you inhale

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The feeling of being treated by people

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The feeling of being unable to feel

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Not easy to suffer

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Come

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Come

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't say what you shouldn't say

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Now I am your mouth

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What should I do

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Can't get in at all

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If he doesn't return high heat

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm afraid I can't endure tonight

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Even if you save it

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It will be a fool

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
As long as the high heat is returned tonight

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He still has hope

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Right

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What do you want

272
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Mother

273
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mother

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mother

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Mother

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You are finally awake

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Where am I

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So cold

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So cold

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Mother

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You can't return high heat

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Now you have to cool down

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You hold on

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Changge and others are coming back

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And Mimi

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Mimi and others are leaving with them

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Mother

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They are leaving with them

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They will be back soon

290
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Mimi

291
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I like her so much

292
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ziwen

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Promise me

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Take good care of Mimi

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What are you talking about

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You live

297
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You take care of her yourself

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Did you hear

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Did you hear

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you remember when she was young

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We went hunting together

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We went hunting

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We met a storm

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Cold and thirsty

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Almost died in the snow

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You asked me to hold on

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Said someone would come to save us

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Then someone really came

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Right

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I didn't lie to you that time

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I won't this time

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Ok

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You can hold on

314
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Listen to me

315
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hold on

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't sleep

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Mother

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I lost Anna and Tang when I was young

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I grew up in the slave camp

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you didn't save me

321
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm afraid I would have died long ago

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What do you say

323
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If I didn't have you

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know how many times I died

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Mother

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Wake up

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wake up, don't sleep

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Mother, wake up

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Mother

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mother

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't sleep, mother

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I know it in my heart

333
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This time

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I really can't stand it

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Mother

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Mother

337
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Mother, wake up

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Mother

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Mother, don't sleep, mother

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Go

341
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Run again

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The horse is dying

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's rest here for an hour

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Everyone, come down and eat something

345
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So I'll go find some firewood

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Light the fire for everyone

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
it is good

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Come

349
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
To destroy the grass

350
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can't live

351
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Mother

352
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Give me the water

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Take it

354
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Be careful

355
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There is a wolf

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Qu Fang, Shiba

357
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Protect the lady and the grass

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You go first

359
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The rest of us and me wait

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Mr. Xian, be careful

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Come

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Shiba

364
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You come

365
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I

366
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I believe you

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I believe you too

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can't

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can do it

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I and Shiba are waiting for you

371
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hurry up

372
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Go

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Are you ok

374
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Go

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yu Yu

376
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
To destroy the grass

377
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't live

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I promise you

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I will not let you go

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I will definitely bring the grass back

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Mimi

382
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I like you

383
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I can't lose my mother anymore

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Go

387
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You are awake

388
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't move

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A lot of blood has just flowed

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Help me up

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You slow down

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Slow down

393
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I finally bandaged your wound

394
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't break the wound

395
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't want to take advantage of you

396
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But I can't put you on the side of the road

397
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Ignore it

398
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You can take me as a support

399
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Just rely on it

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What are you doing

401
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Qin Lang is chasing Mimi

402
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He should see the Eagle Division

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I made you a grass shop

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not so sticky when riding later

405
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then let's go

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I put it on you first

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Your leg is hurt

408
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
A little numb

410
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Sun

411
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sun Zhenran has tried his best

412
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't make it difficult for him

413
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't worry

414
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I will be there

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't worry

416
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I will be there

417
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Don't worry

418
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I will be there

419
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't worry

420
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Don't worry

421
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I will be there

422
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Don't worry

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Don't make it difficult for him

424
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Shut up

425
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Don't say sad words

426
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Sun

427
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Help me up

428
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I want to see the sunrise again

429
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Sun

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I am afraid that I won't have a chance to talk about something now

431
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I only have you in my life

432
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Don't put yourself in it

433
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You have paid back the debt and the debt to me for so many years

434
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I am a brother and I am not a good brother

435
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You are the only one in my life

436
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I have one more thing to ask you

437
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Mimi Guli

438
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Mimi Guli

439
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She was really hard-hearted

440
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I won't care about her if you die

441
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You will

442
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You are just a little bit heartless

443
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You are so stubborn

444
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I know you so well

445
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I know you so well

446
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Mu Qi

447
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Go

448
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Master

449
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The one who dies is the one who lives

450
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Look at her

451
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Is she still alive?

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Didn't you say that there are weeds and there is salvation?

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Where are the weeds?

454
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Mu Qi

455
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I didn't promise you anything

456
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Did you hear me?

457
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Your own woman protects herself

458
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Did you hear me?

459
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Mu Qi

460
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I am back

461
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The bathroom is back

462
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Move away

463
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Mu Qi

464
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Mu Qi

465
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Mu Qi

466
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Don't scare me

467
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Wake up Mu Qi

468
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Don't scare me

469
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You bastard

470
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You were waiting for me to come back

471
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Wake up

472
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Wake up

473
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Don't cry

474
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
She still has a breath

475
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Hurry up and help your man fry the medicine

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Hurry up

477
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Mu Qi

478
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Mu Qi

479
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Wake up

480
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hurry up

481
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Move away

482
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Mu Qi

483
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Mu Qi

484
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You are so sick

485
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You still don't take the medicine

486
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You are so sick

487
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You still don't take the medicine

488
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
If you can't speak

489
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Don't force yourself

490
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Right, Khan

491
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I will tell you a good news

492
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We are going to move to the imperial court

493
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I have prepared everything for you

494
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I am here to see Khan

495
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Come in

496
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Khatun

497
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Don't worry

498
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Just say it

499
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Say it

500
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's useless

501
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let them bring back the silk grass

502
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It seems that this is a very strong power

503
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Should we kill Bu Zhen?

504
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Who kills when

505
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's going to be a big problem

506
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Khan, don't worry

507
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I won't kill you now

508
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I promise

509
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
How can I deal with Eagle Division

510
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
All on a mini Guli

511
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I have other ways

512
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Send the army to the north of the desert

513
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Decided

514
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The bear is here

515
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Tu Kashe is waiting outside the tent

516
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Khan

517
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Do you want to see Tu Kashe?

518
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Tu Kashe greets Khan

519
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Khatun

520
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Tu Kashe is especially kind

521
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Get up

522
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Thank you, Khatun

523
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This is the order written by Khan

524
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I am a womanizer

525
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's not convenient to come

526
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You see for yourself

527
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I am a womanizer

528
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I am a womanizer

529
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's not convenient to come

530
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You see for yourself

531
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yes, Khatun

532
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Khan

533
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Tu Kashe has been waiting for a big problem

534
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
This time to pacify the desert

535
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I will not let Khan down

536
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Khan is disappointed

537
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Khan

538
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You can rest assured

539
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Tu Kashe will definitely not be as good as the mission

540
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Tu Kashe is particularly kind

541
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Khan should take medicine

542
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Then Tu Kashe will leave

543
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Khan

544
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Take care of your body

545
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Want to ask for help

546
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Tu Kashe is particularly kind

547
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Now I can't wait to go to war

548
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
To help the Bear Division

549
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
He has no leisure

550
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
To check your expression

551
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You think

552
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
He is Ashile Sun

553
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Missed son

554
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Pity

555
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You may never see him again

556
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Qin Lang

557
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Where is Changge

558
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Xu Feng and Shiba are not here

559
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We came on the way

560
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Shiba is injured

561
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He and Xu Feng will arrive later

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
As for the little master

563
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
What happened to Changge

564
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
In order to let us

565
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Can bring the purple grass back

566
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Little master

567
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
As a hostage

568
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Left in Mobei

569
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
How come

570
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yazhang, he is in Mobei

571
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
War in the south

572
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And also

573
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Want to detain

574
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The two leaders' wives

575
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Instead of being suppressed

576
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's better to cooperate with the alliance

577
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Little master

578
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
To the King of Mobei

579
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Assured that you can persuade you

580
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Joint forces

581
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
To be a hostage

582
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So the King of Mobei

583
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let us come back

584
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So it is

585
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
This

586
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I know

587
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You will have concerns about the resistance to Yazhang

588
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
After you see the little master

589
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You two discuss it together

590
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Come

591
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Does your hand still hurt

592
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Is it delicious

593
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Delicious

594
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What you said before you left

595
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I remember

596
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Don't mention it

597
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I remember

598
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Don't mention it

599
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That won't work

600
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What you say is water

601
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You don't regret it

602
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
sour

603
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'll go get the medicine

604
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Ok

605
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Ok

606
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Come in

607
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Your previous bandage

608
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Is tied a little bit urgent

609
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Although it is only blood

610
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But it is not tied well

611
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
When I just changed the medicine

612
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Did you hurt your wife?

613
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No

614
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Sorry to bother you

615
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
No trouble

616
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
If you have any inconveniences

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Just tell me

618
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You are welcome

619
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You are all the benefactors of Eagle Division

620
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Thank you, aunt

621
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You have a good rest

622
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'll go out and do my work

623
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
it is good

624
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Thank you

625
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You are welcome

626
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Does it still hurt

627
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Much better

628
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's good

629
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You come

630
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Come

631
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Sit

632
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Why haven't you bandaged yet

633
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Not yet

634
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I help you

635
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Painful

636
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Not painful

637
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I am lighter

638
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Ok

639
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Ok

640
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Ok

641
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The medicine is ready

642
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This is not bandaged yet

643
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You

644
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You do it yourself

645
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We Eagle Division

646
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Just breathed

647
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Just call us to fight to the desert

648
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What do you think

649
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Changge is in the north of the desert

650
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If I don't go

651
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Then it will be someone else

652
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What do you say

653
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let us fight together with the Bear Division

654
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Look at

655
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Just send the Bear Division to watch you

656
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Now

657
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Can only take a step

658
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Mu Jin

659
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You just recovered this time

660
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't go to the north

661
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I won't be so ungrateful

662
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Who told me to have one

663
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Brother who makes people upset

664
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
What about my brother

665
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Now I think

666
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Changge's suggestion is not completely inedible

667
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
What suggestion

668
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Bandage

669
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's really not the old bandage

670
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You should have thought about the first floor

671
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The grace of the bandage

672
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's over

673
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Ketun

674
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Tu Kashto Qin, please stand up

675
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Thank you Ketun

676
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't know what Ketun called at night

677
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
What do you think

678
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Of course, the Great Khan has a secret order for you

679
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Great Khan is seriously ill

680
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You have seen

681
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Now the bandage

682
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
On the surface, it looks like a wind and waves

683
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
In fact, one person is in danger of death

684
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It can be called internal and external troubles

685
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I know the external trouble

686
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This internal trouble

687
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I am a womanizer

688
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't know the internal military affairs of the sub-border

689
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Just listen to the Great Khan

690
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I once read

691
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Between Bear Division, Eagle Division and Wolf Division

692
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
The strength of Eagle Division is the strongest

693
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's a pity that the people of Eagle Division

694
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The heart of Eagle Division is facing Ashile Sun

695
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Not Yanli Khan

696
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's right

697
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If I wasn't there

698
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Ashile Sun would have been in trouble

699
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Now the Great Khan is seriously ill

700
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
No one can decide on this bandage

701
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm worried

702
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If Eagle Division is suspicious

703
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Ketun, rest assured

704
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I will fight against Ashile Sun

705
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Endure to the end

706
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, no, no

707
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Tegin

708
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
If you die

709
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You will only lose heavily

710
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What does Ketun mean?

711
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So the Great Khan sent me to order you

712
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
This time, the peace is not prepared

713
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You can see the strength of Eagle Division

714
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The strength of the Wolf Division

715
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I understand

716
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Then Tu Kashe is leaving

717
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I understand

718
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I understand

719
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Your skill of killing people with a sword

720
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's really good

721
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Ashile Sun has always been the heart of Tu Kashe

722
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm just pushing the boat

723
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Just

724
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What are you worried about?

725
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Tu Kashe has always been reckless

726
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm afraid I will go to the front

727
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You send the dead to watch in secret

728
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
If Tu Kashe fails

729
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I want you to order the dead to shoot Ashile Sun

730
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Make sure nothing is wrong

731
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'll do it now

732
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What are these?

733
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
These places in the red circle

734
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Are all places where you and your father

735
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And the king of Mobei are friends

736
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Now all the troops in the desert are on the road

737
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
These two people can reach Mobei

738
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The number of people who are wrong can be nearly 30,000

739
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Plus you and I

740
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
How is it more than 80,000?

741
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Wow, so much

742
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Then we will win this time

743
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Not necessarily

744
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
why

745
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So many people

746
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Can't we beat them?

747
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
If there are only two people, it's good to be a pair

748
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But now there are too many tribes involved

749
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is a new team

750
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:04,360
No

751
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Do you want to take the opportunity to cause me trouble?

752
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's time for a political battle

753
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You two still don't fight

754
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's clear that he was the one who picked him up first

755
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Report

756
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Commander, Ashile

757
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Ashile is calling

758
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Which one

759
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The front army is hanging

760
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Eagle Division and Bear Division's flag

761
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Eagle Division

762
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Eagle Division is here

763
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This is easy

764
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Eagle Division

765
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Eagle Division

766
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Eagle Division

767
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Eagle Division

768
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Eagle Division

769
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Eagle Division

770
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Eagle Division

771
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Eagle Division

772
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Eagle Division

773
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Eagle Division

774
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Eagle Division

775
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Eagle Division

776
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Eagle Division

777
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Eagle Division

778
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Eagle Division
