1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Towards the distance

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,960
It's broken my wings

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,960
I still have to fly

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Following the light

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I'll forget you

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll break through the stubbornness

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I'll use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,960
To return to the long yearning in the dark night

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I'll climb the river of life and never forget the madness

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Zixin, the water is ready

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Doctor Su and Nuer went to the front to scout the road

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
They've already found the person who will replace us

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Follow the team to continue to the outskirts

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Then go back to the prairie

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
But according to our current schedule

19
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
We should be able to get there in half a month

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Half a month

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Half a month is too long

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
We have to hurry

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Yes

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
That is

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Why is there a corpse there?

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Why is it this guy?

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Deqin, what's wrong with you?

28
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Ya Luo

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Go find a place to rest

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Yes

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Deqin, let me carry it

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
No need

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
When did Deqin like to be so nosy?

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
It's like a treasure

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Search carefully

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
We need to find the person alive

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
We need to find the corpse

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Yes

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Deqin

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Wei Shuyu

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Congratulations

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Congratulations

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
You took Li Changge's life

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
And shot him in the head

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,960
You did a great job to defeat the rebels

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I have to report to His Highness

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,960
And tell him about your plan

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Hao Du, you are too vicious

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
You don't know whether Changge is guilty or not

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
It doesn't matter what I think

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I am a father

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I will do as my father says

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
But I have to tell you

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
There is no such thing as beauty in this world

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
If you want to help the Wei family

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Just do it

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Deqin

58
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
This is the place where the rebels usually rest

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
No one should come

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Go get the wine and medicine

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
And get a suit of clothes

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Yes

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Go

64
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Shameless

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Why are you hitting me?

66
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
What are you doing?

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
You said what I am doing

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
What did you see?

69
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
You are a man

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
What's there to see?

71
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Then why are your eyes blind?

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
I don't like to see the snow stars

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I am not interested in your wounds

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
I want to see you

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Do you think I am a fool?

76
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Yes

77
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Then I don't want to see your eyes

78
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
I want to see your eyes

79
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I want to see your eyes

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
If you want to see my eyes

81
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Then I will do it

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,880
Since you're so capable,

84
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,440
do it yourself.

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,640
I didn't ask you to help me.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,480
Listen to me.

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,560
Aliqi.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What do you mean?

89
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,160
The elite pourquoi of the western region.

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I'm much better. Thank you.

91
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Are you crazy?

92
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Hold on.

93
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
It's a man. Give him the medicine.

94
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't touch me!

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Don't yell like a mother.

96
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,960
You can't wait until now.

97
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Leave him alone.

98
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Let's go.

99
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I'll go.

100
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Father, you're...

101
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Prince Qin came just now.

102
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
He was scolded by me.

103
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,960
I believe he'll send someone to

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
punish me.

105
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Father, I'll go prepare the horse.

106
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
You go back to your hometown to raise the goods.

107
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I'll go find Mr. Du.

108
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Shuyu, I'm not a coward.

109
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
It's just

110
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I've got Waner involved.

111
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Father, I'm useless.

112
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I can't catch A'ye

113
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
and defend Wei.

114
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Get up.

115
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I did what I did.

116
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
How does it concern you?

117
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Prince Qin came today.

118
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,960
He's really a brave man.

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,960
If I want to follow Prince Qin in the future,

120
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
I won't stop you.

121
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,960
A'ye, I don't know if

122
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I made the right choice.

123
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Mr. Wei, this is what the Crown Prince asked me to give you.

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
A'ye, I can't.

125
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I'll beg the Crown Prince. I'll beg Mr. Du.

126
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Shuyu.

127
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
A'ye.

128
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Take it.

129
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Mr. Wei, take your time.

130
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
I'll go find Mr. Du.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll go find Mr. Du.

132
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Take your time.

133
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
A'ye.

134
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
A'ye, I can't.

135
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I'll beg the Crown Prince. I'll beg Mr. Du.

136
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
You're young.

137
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,960
How did I teach you?

138
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Let go.

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Let go.

140
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Cucin.

141
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,960
The palace often says that Mr. Wei is a cuckold.

142
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
The Crown Princess and the Crown Prince are in the palace.

143
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
They are all in good health.

144
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Today, they are in bad health.

145
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Mr. Wei is a cuckold.

146
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
A'ye.

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
A'ye, I can't.

148
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
A'ye.

149
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm being petty.

150
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,960
But the King of Qin is capable of taking advantage of the situation.

151
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Although we are in different camps,

152
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,960
I won't say it out loud, but I know

153
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,960
that the King of Qin is kind and kind.

154
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,960
But he also has his own ways of killing.

155
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,960
This change cannot be stopped.

156
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,960
If I can defend myself for the sake of Zhong Zhen,

157
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,960
but the land we have is still the land of Tang.

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,960
The people of Yun Yun are still the people of Tang.

159
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Isn't my life's wish

160
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,960
to protect Tang?

161
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,960
A'ye, I understand.

162
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Zhong Yisheng has never captured many people.

163
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
This Cucin

164
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,960
makes me feel so blessed.

165
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
I'm so happy.

166
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm so happy.

167
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm so happy.

168
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm so happy.

169
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm so happy.

170
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm so happy.

171
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm so happy.

172
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm so happy.

173
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm so happy.

174
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
I'm so happy.

175
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm so happy.

176
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm so happy.

177
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I'm so happy.

178
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm so happy.

179
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Come, drink some water.

180
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,960
It was my misunderstanding to previous time.

181
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,960
If you can give me life, I will definitely...

182
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
No need.

183
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Let's not be Ov Wohnung I'm not against you.

184
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Can you give me another drink?

185
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Sure.

186
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
But I never do business with you.

187
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,960
How about we exchange drinks? I'll give you a drink.

188
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
You answer my question.

189
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
How about it?

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
We come and go.

191
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Let's play a game. Do you dare?

192
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I don't dare to play a game.

193
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Let's ask each other a question.

194
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Whoever doesn't answer the question,

195
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
will be punished with a large amount of wine.

196
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Okay.

197
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
You ask.

198
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Where did you get the sword wound?

199
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,960
From the Imperial Army.

200
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
You're so honest.

201
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Since we exchanged drinks, I can't lie.

202
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
It's my turn.

203
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
How should I call you?

204
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
My surname is Qin.

205
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
One word is correct.

206
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
You can call me A'Zhuang.

207
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
A'Zhuang.

208
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
What about you?

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
My surname is Li.

210
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm ranked 14th.

211
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
You can call me the 14th.

212
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Why do you insist on my sword wound?

213
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,960
I just want to see you look ugly.

214
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I know you're a bad person.

215
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
A'Zhuang, where are you from?

216
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm from Central Plains.

217
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I was born in Sai Wan.

218
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Then you're from...

219
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
That's another question.

220
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Next,

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,960
where is the 14th Wolf going?

222
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
To avenge.

223
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Where are you going?

224
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,960
To avenge the north.

225
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
What are you doing in the north?

226
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm doing a big business.

227
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Since you're back, why do you still want to drink?

228
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Because you'll ask me

229
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
what business I'm doing.

230
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,960
I can't answer.

231
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,960
I'm afraid I'll get drunk if I keep drinking.

232
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Then I'll ask you one last question.

233
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Is A'Zhun really A'Zhun?

234
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Is the 14th Wolf really the 14th Wolf?

235
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Come on.

236
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
What is Te Qin talking to that guy?

237
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
I haven't heard him laugh like this in a long time.

238
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Te Qin has been in charge of Eagle Division for so many years.

239
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
But he has been suspected by Da Ke Han.

240
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
And there's that dead man everywhere.

241
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
In that environment,

242
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
you're the one who's going to be punished.

243
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
You know that.

244
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
That's true.

245
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
But it's okay not to mention it.

246
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,960
So as not to spoil the mood.

247
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
But I haven't seen anyone

248
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
who Te Qin is so concerned about.

249
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Your Highness.

250
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
The spread of the rumors

251
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
has nothing to do with Princess Yong Ning.

252
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm afraid someone else did it.

253
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
As for Princess Yong Ning,

254
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
I'm incompetent.

255
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I let her escape.

256
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Fine.

257
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
For many days,

258
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,960
the heavy troops in the capital have been sleeping in.

259
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Even if she has actions,

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
she never loves.

261
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
You should be more careful.

262
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Yes.

263
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Ke Ming.

264
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
What else do you want?

265
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,960
The two things Chang Ge took away

266
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
are the important weapons of the court.

267
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
No matter what,

268
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,960
can't it be taken away by someone else?

269
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
I understand.

270
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Wei Zheng is right.

271
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm the most ruthless person in the world.

272
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Princess.

273
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Princess.

274
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Mr. Du.

275
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
His Highness is inside.

276
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Go in.

277
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Go.

278
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
He Qi.

279
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Let's get up.

280
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Where's the boy?

281
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Went.

282
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Went?

283
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Why didn't you tell him and he left?

284
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Su Yishe.

285
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Send food and fire back to Eagle Division.

286
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Tell them to prepare these.

287
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,240
Wait for me outside Youzhou.

288
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,960
And

289
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
give this to Great Khan.

290
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,080
Don't worry, Tuxi.

291
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,960
Go.

292
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,040
Tuxi.

293
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,480
What should we do after we go to Youzhou?

294
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,720
I've already asked Su Yishe

295
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,800
to prepare the food and fire.

296
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,040
Okay.

297
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,040
Greetings, Father.

298
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,760
It's rare to see you come to see me.

299
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
What's up?

300
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,840
Nothing.

301
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,880
I just want to visit you.

302
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm sorry to bother you.

303
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,680
If there's nothing else,

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,240
you should go back to rest.

305
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,480
I have a lot of things to do.

306
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,240
I actually want to

307
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,440
ask Changge...

308
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,280
I beg you not to hurt him.

309
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,560
He's just a little bit more aggressive.

310
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,520
But he...

311
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,520
Yan'er.

312
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,840
Forget about this world.

313
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,040
There's still Changge.

314
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,360
It's good for you and him.

315
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,560
Father.

316
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,880
Your Highness.

317
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,920
Someone is here.

318
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,280
They're here to see Her Highness.

319
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,240
His Majesty heard that Her Highness

320
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,680
was very kind and willing to marry into the grassland.

321
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,800
He asked me to send him a gift

322
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,400
and a letter of edict.

323
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,240
Please listen to it.

324
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,560
The daughter of the Crown Prince

325
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,120
is pregnant and has a wife.

326
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,640
Tang Mudog has permission

327
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,680
to send Princess Yong'an

328
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,400
3,000 houses to her.

329
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,640
The leader of them will eat her while she's still asleep.

330
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Princess Yong'an.

331
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,360
intercept the edict quickly.

332
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,020
Prince Yong'an.

333
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,120
I hereby thank Heaven for your kindness.

334
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
Let's go.

335
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,040
Yin.

336
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,320
Essence,

337
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,000
do whatever you want

338
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,400
to do v NASA.

339
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,760
Let's go!

340
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,280
No, no, no.

341
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,520
Let's also go to the preventive zone first!

342
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,020
You have to

343
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,520
and Plum Village

344
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,520
good

345
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
my police dad

346
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,100
Ting Zeng is sad

347
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,080
Is that because his highness is still so obsessed with Li Changge

348
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,020
Li Changge

349
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,660
If she's still alive,

350
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,780
she must be in trouble.

351
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,260
I don't understand.

352
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,340
Why would Li Changge

353
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,460
let the Crown Prince,

354
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,340
Princess,

355
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
and the Wei family

356
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,740
care about her?

357
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
The Crown Prince loves her

358
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,860
with all his heart.

359
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,860
The Princess loves her

360
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,260
with all her heart.

361
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,940
As for Young Master Wei...

362
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,100
If Li Changge is still alive,

363
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,340
she'll go to Wei Shuyu

364
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,140
and tell her

365
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,300
to find Crown Prince

366
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,540
and get rid of her.

367
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,460
Understood.

368
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,540
Hao Du.

369
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,020
Remember.

370
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,580
Don't be afraid of the Young Mistress

371
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,100
when you do something big.

372
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,300
Don't be bound by

373
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,700
your love.

374
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,500
Yes.

375
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
(*Li Changge's tomb*)

376
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
This is the place

377
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
where Li Bei died in Chang'an.

378
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,300
I didn't expect

379
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,380
I'd end up here.

380
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
It hurts!

381
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,580
A'Dou.

382
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,020
Master, what's wrong?

383
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,620
Nothing.

384
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,380
Why are you here?

385
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,660
I didn't ask you...

386
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,180
I've been waiting here for a day.

387
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,220
I knew you were going to the north.

388
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,420
I'm sure

389
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,060
you'll pass the Chang'an barrier.

390
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,180
How is it, Master?

391
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,500
I've been following you for days.

392
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm a little nervous.

393
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,940
But if you don't show up,

394
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,300
I'll be suspicious

395
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
if I'm wrong.

396
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,580
A'Dou.

397
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,340
I don't know

398
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,620
where the future is.

399
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,500
You still have a bright future to go.

400
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,500
Although you can't stay in the品香氈,

401
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,540
you still have other choices.

402
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,140
Why are you following me?

403
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,220
Master, you're my future.

404
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,260
I'll follow you for life and death.

405
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
A'Dou said

406
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,700
he wouldn't look away.

407
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,140
You're a hero.

408
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,540
No hero has a general to help him.

409
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,500
I'm your general.

410
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,780
Master, A'Dou is serious.

411
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,020
A'Dou.

412
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,580
Master,

413
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,260
let me follow you.

414
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,180
Ketou.

415
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,300
Since you're going to worship a master,

416
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,140
you should have a proper gift.

417
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,100
Master, please accept my bow.

418
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,740
Thank you.

419
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
From now on,

420
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,820
you're my disciple.

421
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,380
We'll be like a family.

422
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,820
Okay.

423
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,380
Master, where are we going?

424
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,620
To Youzhou.

425
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,780
My father's old horse is there.

426
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,020
The governor of Youzhou, Li Yuan,

427
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,660
used my father as a friend.

428
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,740
And

429
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,660
if I can persuade him to send troops to help,

430
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
I'll have hope.

431
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,100
Then

432
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,300
I'll be a general soon.

433
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Soon.

434
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,540
But

435
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,460
I won't give up.

436
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,080
Kevin Han

437
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,000
It depends in hongmen.

438
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,780
I can't afford to be a

439
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,780
common visitor.

440
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,780
I'm here to apologize to you.

441
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
You're right.

442
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
I scolded you.

443
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
What did you say?

444
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:25,180
This is the gift for the

445
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
wedding.

446
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
You're a good father.

447
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
When Ni Xinmei died,

448
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
did you think about it?

449
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
I'm sorry to bother you.

450
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
I have a few mothers and sons in my family.

451
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
I have a few mothers and sons in my family.

452
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
It's enough to support my children.

453
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
It turns out that people like Mr. Wei

454
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
will also care about their children.

455
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
It turns out that people like Mr. Wei will also care about their children.

456
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
What do you want to say?

457
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
What do you want to say?

458
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
I just said it casually.

459
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I have a son.

460
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
I can't help worrying.

461
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
I have read a lot of holy books.

462
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
I don't know

463
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,540
how to seduce them

464
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,540
as the head of the family.

465
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,540
I'm also a father.

466
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
I'm also a father.

467
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I'm also a father.

468
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
I'm also a father.

469
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,540
I also heard

470
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
that Princess Yongan is getting married.

471
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
If you

472
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
want to do this,

473
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
I have an idea.

474
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,540
I have an idea.

475
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Please say it first.

476
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
What?

477
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
What?

478
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
I have a strange disease?

479
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Yes, you remember.

480
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
The strange disease you have is not going to get better.

481
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
You have to go to Luoyang to treat it.

482
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Go to Luoyang?

483
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Yes. I have arranged everything for you.

484
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
You can leave now.

485
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
The sooner the better.

486
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Go.

487
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
You're crying because you can't say a few words.

488
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
You're crying because you can't say a few words.

489
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,540
How can you be like a princess?

490
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,540
You should think more about Changge.

491
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
Yan'er.

492
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
Because you have this strange disease,

493
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,540
you can't get married for a long time.

494
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
You can't get married for a long time.

495
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,540
You can't get married for a long time.

496
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,540
Do you understand?

497
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,540
Yes.

498
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,540
You should rest in Luoyang.

499
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,540
When you recover,

500
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,540
I will send someone to pick you up.

501
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,540
I know you and that young man Wei have always been close.

502
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,540
I have ordered him

503
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
to escort you to Luoyang.

504
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,540
He will take care of you.

505
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
You can rest assured.

506
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Yes.

507
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
Brother Shouye.

508
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
I will send you to Luoyang.

509
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
Thank you, Brother Shouye.

510
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
You will understand me in the future.

511
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Come here.

512
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Okay. Next.

513
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
Be careful.

514
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Next.

515
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,540
Go there.

516
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Okay. Go there.

517
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Next.

518
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Go there.

519
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
What's in your car?

520
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,540
It's food.

521
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Food?

522
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
You, you, go there and search.

523
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Yes.

524
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Sir, don't search. It's food.

525
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
It's not up to you.

526
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,540
It's not up to you.

527
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Is there any problem?

528
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
No.

529
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,540
Thank you, sir.

530
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Go.

531
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Wait.

532
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
Sir.

533
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,540
Why are you in a panic?

534
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
No, sir.

535
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
What's in your car?

536
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
It's food.

537
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
Sir.

538
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Check it.

539
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Yes.

540
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Don't...

541
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,540
Don't...

542
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Don't...

543
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Don't...

544
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Don't...

545
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
Don't...

546
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
Don't...

547
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Don't...

548
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
General, what's this?

549
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
We didn't find anything.

550
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
You didn't see anything.

551
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,540
We didn't find anything.

552
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
General,

553
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,540
what's this?

554
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
General,

555
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
we didn't find anything.

556
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
You didn't see anything.

557
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Remember?

558
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
Yes.

559
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
Don't forget, sir.

560
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Hurry.

561
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Sir, don't forget.

562
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
Thank you.

563
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,540
You're welcome.

564
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,540
Sir,

565
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,540
you're so smart.

566
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,540
Without the carriage,

567
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
we can't get to Youzhou so fast.

568
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,540
I'm afraid we'll get soaked.

569
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
It's called a lesson.

570
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
Learn it.

571
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
The food is really good.

572
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,540
Be careful.

573
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,540
What are we doing?

574
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
What are we doing?

575
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,540
Let's go to the front.

576
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
We'll live here.

577
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,540
Please.

578
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,540
Coming.

579
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Sir,

580
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,540
what room do you want?

581
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Is there the cheapest room?

582
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
The cheapest room?

583
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
This way.

584
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,540
Sir, please.

585
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,540
Sir,

586
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,540
have a look.

587
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Although the room is small,

588
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
it's not a problem to give you two a room.

589
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Sir, are you satisfied?

590
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,540
Yes.

591
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Okay, take a rest.

592
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,540
I'll get you some hot water.

593
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,540
I'll check around the capital.

594
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Stay here.

595
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,540
Yes.

596
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Sir,

597
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
please be patient.

598
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
It's good that

599
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,540
the manager can sleep in the woodshed.

600
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I'll clean it up.

601
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
I'll give you a comfortable place to sleep.

602
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Don't be too tired.

603
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,540
I won't be particular about going out.

604
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Sir, I'm not tired.

605
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Please have a rest.

606
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I'll go out and check.

607
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
Sir, I'll go with you.

608
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
You're still going out with me.

609
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Have a rest.

610
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,540
I'll bring you some food.

611
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
This is the last stop.

612
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
We can arrive at Luoyang Xinggong tomorrow.

613
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Brother Shuyu,

614
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
are you leaving tomorrow?

615
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
The scenery of Luoyang Xinggong is beautiful.

616
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
All the workers will accompany you.

617
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
The days when we played together

618
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
were like a dream.

619
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
We used to be so happy.

620
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
I'm glad that

621
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
we three used to be so happy.

622
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
I don't know why

623
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
we are now going to the end of the world

624
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
to be separated.

625
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
There is no one in the world

626
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
who can accompany us forever.

627
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Brother Shuyu, I understand.

628
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
The dream should be awake.

629
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
We have grown up.

630
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
Brother Shuyu,

631
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,540
can you

632
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,540
write me a letter

633
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,540
when you are free?

634
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Whenever you have news of Changge,

635
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,540
you must tell me.

636
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
I promise you

637
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,540
I'll find her.

638
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,540
It's getting late.

639
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,540
Go back and have a rest.

640
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Go.

641
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,540
I didn't expect you to be so fast.

642
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
We'll arrive at Luoyang soon.

643
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
Wei Shuyu, listen.

644
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
The crown prince has ordered

645
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
Wei Shuyu to be the special envoy of Chang'an.

646
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,540
No need to go back to Chang'an.

647
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Go to the capital with Hao Du

648
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,540
and go to Youzhou.

649
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Summon Lord Lu Jiang and Li Yuan

650
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,540
to the capital.

651
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Qingrong wants to know

652
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
if you have news of her.

653
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
Do you hope so

654
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
or not?

655
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
Whether it's true or not,

656
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
you can go to the capital with me.

657
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Besides,

658
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Wei Shuyu only needs to be responsible for the incident.

659
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
As for the rest,

660
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
I won't bother you.

661
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Someone saw

662
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
Princess Yongning and a young man

663
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,540
go to Youzhou on the way to the capital.

664
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Listen,

665
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
keep an eye on Wei Shuyu.

666
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
If they meet in private,

667
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,540
they'll kill Yongning.

668
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
If Wei Shuyu is not allowed to go,

669
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,540
do it in the same way.

670
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Yes.

671
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,540
Go.

672
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,540
Master, which iron flag is better?

673
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
Go.

674
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,540
Heart gradually responds,

675
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,540
gradually awakens,

676
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,540
gradually swims towards you.

677
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,540
Before saying goodbye,

678
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,540
I look forward to it.

679
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,540
I'll remember your life

680
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:45,540
and lock it into my dream of longing.

681
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Before dawn,

682
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
through the years,

683
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,540
my longing flows.

684
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,540
There's always a moment

685
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,540
which burns down the wastelands in my heart.

686
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,540
There's always a longing

687
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:13,540
which unites us.

688
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
In different worlds,

689
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
in different worlds,

690
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,540
I'll remember your life

691
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,540
and lock it into my dream of longing.

692
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,540
It'll become the eternal

693
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,540
and the cocoon of time.

694
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,540
There's always a moment

695
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,540
which burns down the wastelands in my heart.

696
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,540
There's always a longing

697
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:58,540
which unites us.

698
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
In different worlds,

699
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
in different worlds,

700
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,540
I'll remember your life

701
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,540
and lock it into my dream of longing.

702
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,540
It'll become the eternal

703
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,540
and the cocoon of time.

704
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,540
It'll never end.
