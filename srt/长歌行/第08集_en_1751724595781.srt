1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My heart is burning

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Still has to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Love and forget

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The memory of this is like a sword

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the hope of the past

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Climbing the river of life and not forgetting the craziness

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't talk

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's going on?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't worry

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
As long as you don't show up now

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your master won't be in danger

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All of this means

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It means that the thing is in Youzhou

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's in your hands

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Take it down

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Take it away

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Search

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My master told me

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Li Yuan is the only person he can trust

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I didn't expect this master

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have to go find my master

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You go out now

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It will only make your master die faster

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The things on your body

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It concerns your master's life

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have to hide it

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I believe your master can escape

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't you believe it?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I believe

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My master has nine lives

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, then listen to me

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Go to the gate now

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wait for your master there

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What about you?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Will you save my master?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mind yourself

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Go quickly

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The one who sells the goods

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I believe you

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me ask you

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Where is the thing?

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't think you are Princess Youning

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I dare not to kill you

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She is Li Jiancheng's daughter

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Princess Youning

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No wonder she can steal the Crown Prince's heart

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It turns out to be the Crown Prince's daughter

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The reason why she stole the Crown Prince's heart

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It turns out that the Fourteenth House

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is to seek revenge on Li Shimin

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Junkuo

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You pinch her to death

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who knows the whereabouts of the thing?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Take it back first

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Go

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hide here secretly

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If anyone comes, take him down

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Princess, you still dare not to tell me the whereabouts of the thing

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think the Princess's face looks good

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But it may not be able to be preserved in a while

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I advise you to be honest

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Tell me the truth

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will tell you the truth

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will tell you the truth

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will tell you the truth

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will tell you the truth

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I advise you to be honest

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In case you will be punished for nothing

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have long understood General Wang's ability to change face

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now I say it

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It will be worse

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are really the Princess

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You would rather die than to hand over the thing

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But since you don't care about your own life

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know if you still care about others' lives

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think the guard at home may not live longer than today

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can kill him if you want

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It has nothing to do with me

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Nothing to do with you?

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I saw how the Princess protected the guard

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How about this

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I send someone to bring him here

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You and your old friend have a good talk

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Maybe you can remember something

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It seems that the Princess is really determined

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
To have a clear line with this Chang'an old friend

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ok, I will send her to Xitian now

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you dare to kill him

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You will never get what you want

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's not a big deal

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It seems that the Princess still can't bear it

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Then I will give you some more time

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let you watch her remember

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If there is no result

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You and her will both die

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wei Shuyu

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Wei Shuyu

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If I cooperate with Wang Junkuo

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Youzhou will fall into the hands of Ashile

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Maybe I can use these rebellious soldiers to kill Chang'an

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Li Changge, what are you thinking?

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That is Ashile Tribe

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If you help Wang Junkuo because of this

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You will be the sinner of Tang

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Come in

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Princess

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are we going to set off today?

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wei Shuyu's work is almost done

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Today is the meeting day

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will send you to the east gate later

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
To meet with Wei Shuyu

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You don't go

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't go

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hao Du

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you really meet Changge

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Can you spare her life?

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hao Du

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will go

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Go

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's late

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Please pack up as soon as possible

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Changge

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I know

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are still angry with me

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why are you in Youzhou?

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are not sure enough about me

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You have to see me die before you give up

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Changge

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Stop talking

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Have a good rest

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No matter you believe it or not

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have never betrayed you in the whole life

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I was set up by Hao Du that day

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I was confused by your interest

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So what?

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You chose to go to the mansion anyway

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I am sorry

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't want you to be in the hell because of me

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You think too much

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I am just a fish in the water

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I am angry and sad

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wang Junkuo

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wang Junkuo wants to give Youzhou to Yan Li

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He is a wolf and a wild bitch

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He is so treacherous

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Lord Lujiang is ignoring him

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Lord Lujiang is behind this

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What?

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What will you do?

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What about me?

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Now the ending

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is not what you and your new master want to see

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Changge

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Lord Lujiang loves you the most

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He never

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Stop talking

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Even if I fall down

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I won't be as weak as you

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You came to Youzhou alone

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I have an appointment with Hao Du for the birthday class

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We will meet at the gate of the city

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But you have to believe me

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I won't tell him I have seen you

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You think you still have the Hao Du?

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you want to get out alive

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You have to rely on him

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Somebody

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to see Li Yue

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Somebody

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Changge, what do you want?

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
None of your business

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Somebody

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You don't want to send the child out, do you?

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What else?

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You?

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I want to see Li Yue

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I want to see him

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Come

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Come

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Come

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Come

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to see him

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to see him

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's the chef in your manor?

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No one can eat

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I advise you to be more upfront

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The person in the capital is limited

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I am the princess

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I can't eat anything

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,800
after you make a scene.

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
I have no appetite.

212
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,000
I think you are looking for death.

213
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
Uncle Tang,

214
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
this is the person you gave it to.

215
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,040
Yong Ning,

216
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
it's useless

217
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,200
if you drag it down like this.

218
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,720
It's useless indeed.

219
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,520
I have made an appointment with Suicung.

220
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,880
Even if I go early,

221
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,280
I can't see him.

222
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,080
If I don't go there safely,

223
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,880
he will execute my previous order.

224
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,360
Then,

225
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
no one can get the Crown Prince's heart.

226
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
Yong Ning is Yong Ning.

227
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,480
I still want to see you.

228
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,880
But we are family.

229
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,640
Why do we have to hurt each other?

230
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,440
Uncle Tang, you are right.

231
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
It's late.

232
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,600
We can go now.

233
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,440
Okay.

234
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll wait for your good news.

235
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,600
Uncle Tang,

236
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
Wei Shuyu is my person.

237
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,800
She has to die in my hands.

238
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,520
If she has any three-way or two-way,

239
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,640
I can do anything.

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,080
Please.

241
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,560
Yong Ning who escaped from Chang'an safely

242
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
is caught by Wang Junkuo.

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,520
Wang Junkuo

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,240
What did Ashile Tribe give you?

245
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,840
You'd rather not be a bandit

246
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,840
than a dog in the eyes.

247
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,680
Princess,

248
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,680
do you really think that

249
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,160
someone will sell you

250
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
some empty words?

251
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,280
Moreover, the so-called bandit

252
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,060
is impeccable.

253
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,200
Now the Trail of The rings of those princesses

254
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
are worth some.

255
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,720
Maybe they can sell you something useful.

256
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,180
Aren't you afraid that

257
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
Assange proportion of troops

258
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
will never work

259
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,060
after you spread the news?

260
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,300
No need for you concern.

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,280
You'd better be worried about yourself.

262
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,420
Go, Go where?

263
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,100
Hao Du,

264
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm sorry for being it.

265
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,040
Let's go.

266
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,680
Why is Brother Shuyu...

267
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,280
Chang... Changge...

268
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,320
Be quiet!

269
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,160
If you shout,

270
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,280
Changge will die.

271
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,480
Look at that man.

272
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
Lin Changge was watched by someone.

273
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
Who are they?

274
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,400
I don't know.

275
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
But Lin Changge is here.

276
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Wei Shuyu should be in trouble.

277
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
Brother Shuyu.

278
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
If you don't want Wei Shuyu to be in trouble,

279
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
just stay here.

280
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,800
Don't move.

281
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:17,760
erness

282
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,920
What to do?

283
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,920
Step aside!

284
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,840
Step aside!

285
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
You want to run away?

286
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Who are you?

287
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
I advise you to hand over the item.

288
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,280
Otherwise,

289
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
I will make your master be beheaded.

290
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,880
It's convenient.

291
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,080
But,

292
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,080
you have to hand over his head to me.

293
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,280
So I can take it back to my master.

294
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,280
You are not on his side.

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Who are you?

296
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,480
You

297
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,680
don't deserve to ask me that.

298
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,500
The

299
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,080
Wei Shuyu is in trouble.

300
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,680
I guessed it.

301
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Hao Du.

302
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Brother Cheng Hao.

303
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Brother Cheng.

304
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,480
Let him go.

305
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,680
You go first.

306
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
It's fair to change one's life.

307
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
Leyan.

308
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Why are you here?

309
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,280
Brother Cheng, I...

310
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
What are you waiting for?

311
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
The one in my hand is the princess of Dateng.

312
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Do you know who I have in my hand?

313
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,080
I don't care who he is.

314
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,080
I just want to know who he is.

315
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
I don't care who he is.

316
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
I don't care who he is.

317
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
Let her go.

318
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,280
I count to three.

319
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,880
If you don't let her go,

320
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,080
this woman will die.

321
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Ah Jun, don't do anything stupid.

322
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,080
Hao Du.

323
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,080
Don't hurt Brother Cheng.

324
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Let him go.

325
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,480
Hao Du.

326
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,080
You.

327
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,480
If you don't go, Wang Jun will come to save us.

328
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
We can't leave.

329
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Who are you?

330
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,280
Three.

331
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Go.

332
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,080
Brother Cheng.

333
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,680
Go.

334
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,480
Brother Cheng, go.

335
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,680
Brother Cheng.

336
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,280
Princess.

337
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,480
Princess.

338
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Princess, wait.

339
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,680
Brother Cheng, go.

340
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:10,080
Now.

341
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,680
Haven't you left for a bit long?

342
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,280
I...

343
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I have things to do.

344
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,680
Things to do?

345
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,360
to take back your horse from Wang Junkuo

346
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
or to collude with Ashile Tribe

347
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,440
for Wang Junkuo's signing?

348
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,560
Ah Chun,

349
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,920
don't force me to be your enemy.

350
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,280
I just want to save you.

351
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,360
Thank you for saving me.

352
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,960
I won't ask you about the past.

353
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,760
But from now on,

354
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,600
don't worry about me.

355
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,800
Leave Youzhou.

356
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,520
I should be the one who said that to you.

357
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,120
Those people won't let you go.

358
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,760
You'll die if you go back.

359
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,080
Come with me.

360
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,560
You don't have to tell me about me.

361
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,680
I won't let Youzhou

362
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,120
fall into Ashile Tribe's hands.

363
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,920
If you follow me again,

364
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,280
I'll report you.

365
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,880
The court wants to kill you.

366
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,200
Why do you still help the court?

367
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,240
I hate those who make me destroy the people.

368
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,320
But I'm still the daughter of Tang.

369
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,760
Don't you always want it?

370
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,400
Take it as a defense.

371
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,760
Let go of me. You hurt me.

372
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
Hao Du, let go of me.

373
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,920
Let go of me.

374
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,000
Didn't you hear Changge say

375
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,920
that something happened to Shuyu?

376
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,080
I only care about where Li Changge is.

377
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,560
But Shuyu...

378
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,480
I'll say it again.

379
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
I only care about Li Changge.

380
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,600
I'm here.

381
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,320
Changge.

382
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,920
Changge.

383
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,560
Changge, why are you back?

384
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,520
If you keep moving around,

385
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,480
I'll kill her now.

386
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,520
Li Changge,

387
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,080
don't run away.

388
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
If you don't listen to me,

389
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,040
we can't run away.

390
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,960
I'll listen to you.

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
You still think you're the princess?

392
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,560
You wronged the king of the army

393
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,280
and colluded with the little Khan of Ashile Tribe

394
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,200
to give Youzhou to Ashile Tribe.

395
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,920
Now the army of Wolf Division

396
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
is in danger.

397
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,840
The army of Wolf Division is coming to Youzhou.

398
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,280
Do you think he can escape from me?

399
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
Don't doubt it.

400
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,120
Wei Shuyu

401
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,920
is locked up in the dungeon of the Governor's Office.

402
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,640
If it wasn't for Youzhou,

403
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,520
I wouldn't stand in front of you now.

404
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,280
Hao Du,

405
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,800
let's go save Shuyu now.

406
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,760
Why should I believe you?

407
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,640
Because the person standing in front of you

408
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,800
is me, not Wei Shuyu.

409
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,600
Wei Shuyu has the whole Wei family behind him.

410
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,040
Do you think he'll take the lives of his family

411
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,480
to play a trick on me?

412
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:44,320
Youzhou is your пос

413
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
to stabilize the situation.

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,920
I'll kill you.

415
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,200
Don't mention my father.

416
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,840
You're a thief who stole the Crown Prince's happiness.

417
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,040
Why are you talking about the situation?

418
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,280
Lv Changge.

419
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,840
Even if what you said is true,

420
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
I won't let you escape.

421
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,160
You don't care about the public and the private.

422
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,840
How can you achieve such a big thing?

423
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,560
Whether I can achieve it or not, you don't need to call me.

424
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,400
It's a big deal to take the Crown Prince's happiness back.

425
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
If Wang Junkuo succeeds,

426
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
it's too late to send troops to the court.

427
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,840
I'll kill you.

428
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,160
Lv Changge.

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't care if what you said is true.

430
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,840
My main task now

431
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,880
is to send Princess out of Youzhou safely.

432
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,120
If you still take Princess as a friend,

433
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,320
cooperate with her.

434
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,160
You're useless.

435
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,120
So many people.

436
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,600
You let him escape.

437
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
I deserve to die.

438
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
I ordered someone to search Lv Changge in the city

439
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,600
and ordered to close the city gate.

440
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,320
I don't care what you do.

441
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,120
I must take the thing tomorrow.

442
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,520
Otherwise, you and I

443
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,840
can't even eat and walk in front of the Khan.

444
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,800
Duoduo.

445
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,560
I have one more thing to report.

446
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,960
I found that

447
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,880
there is another group of people

448
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,920
who are also following Lv Changge.

449
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
They are powerful.

450
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,720
They are not common people like me.

451
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,920
They are not common people.

452
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,800
Are they from the court?

453
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,640
Then you and I...

454
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,280
Duoduo.

455
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
Don't worry.

456
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,160
I found that person

457
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,000
doesn't care about Lv Changge's life and death.

458
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,840
He just wants to catch her.

459
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
So I suspect that person

460
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,560
may come for the Crown Prince's happiness.

461
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,120
Now,

462
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,520
there is no way out.

463
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,720
I want Lv Changge and the court.

464
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,360
I understand.

465
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,320
As long as he is here,

466
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,800
we can't leave Youzhou for a while.

467
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,480
Is there anything about the Khan?

468
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Yanli Khan's army is coming.

469
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,800
We just need to block the news

470
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,200
of Youzhou and other places.

471
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,360
When the army of the Khan's Wolf Division comes,

472
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,840
we will have no other choice.

473
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,040
This is the only way

474
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
for us to get back our glory.

475
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,440
We will follow Duoduo's order.

476
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,240
Hurry up.

477
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,920
Close the gate.

478
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
No one can enter or leave.

479
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Close the gate?

480
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,160
Why are you so anxious?

481
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
General Wang ordered to go straight.

482
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,240
If the prisoner runs away,

483
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
I will kill you.

484
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,720
Yes.

485
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,760
Changge,

486
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,400
I have always liked to lean on your shoulder.

487
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,200
As long as you are here,

488
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,360
I feel very assured.

489
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,080
It's useless to be anxious.

490
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,200
I don't even know

491
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,480
when I can lean on your shoulder

492
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,440
next time.

493
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Untie the rope.

494
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,680
My hand hurts.

495
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,360
Yanli Relaxation Center

496
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,960
取強哥。

497
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,760
你太小看我了吧。

498
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,700
Depend on yourself in return forales

499
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
If you want to escape,

500
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,140
don't think too highly of yourself

501
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,780
and never use the slightest rightください

502
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,560
If you are!!]

503
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,400
And if you are also shameless,

504
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,240
they will dump you

505
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,880
in aЯ pose

506
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,020
캡 혹시

507
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,860
And if you make fun of them

508
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,260
Is it more important than our lives

509
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,340
and the lives of the people of Youzhou?

510
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,420
Youzhou has been sealed.

511
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,460
I can't save the people of Youzhou

512
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,780
nor Wei Shuyu.

513
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,940
Then you just watch Shuyu die?

514
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,700
We'll set a fire and tell the court.

515
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,340
That's the only way.

516
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,420
You mean

517
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,860
Shuyu is saved?

518
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,420
God bless us.

519
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,780
Why is it you?

520
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,820
Get up.

521
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,500
Why are you here?

522
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,300
The seller told me to wait for you at the gate.

523
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
I kept watching

524
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,780
and didn't dare to blink.

525
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,420
Then I saw the soldiers blocking the gate.

526
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,460
There was only one carriage

527
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,660
leaving the city at the last moment.

528
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,820
I thought

529
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,020
this was the last chance for Master to escape.

530
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,180
So I followed him.

531
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,780
I didn't expect

532
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,340
the seller was right.

533
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,020
What did he say?

534
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,100
He said he believed Master

535
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,340
could escape.

536
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,500
Where is the thing?

537
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,380
Here.

538
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,700
The thing is here.

539
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,020
By the way, Master,

540
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,900
who is the person who tied you up?

541
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,340
Chang An.

542
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,100
You're all in Youzhou?

543
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,380
It's urgent now.

544
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,940
I need to go and save the soldiers.

545
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,900
A'Dou, wait for me here.

546
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,700
Master,

547
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,660
don't leave me again.

548
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,420
I'm facing the army of Youzhou now.

549
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,900
If I don't go there now,

550
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,020
Wang Junkuo will succeed.

551
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,700
He will be in a big trouble.

552
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,340
Why are you going there?

553
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,700
Because I know nothing about the other side.

554
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,100
Besides,

555
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
I don't believe the army of Youzhou

556
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,540
will follow Wang Junkuo to be a dog.

557
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,780
Master,

558
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,500
don't leave me again.

559
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,940
A'Dou wants to go to the battlefield

560
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
to see the real army.

561
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:43,900
This time,

562
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,620
he won't let you go alone.

563
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,140
Okay.

564
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,340
I'll take you there

565
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,420
to see

566
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,980
what the real army is.

567
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,420
Yes.

568
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,780
Before I go,

569
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,860
I need to see someone.

570
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,980
Wait for me outside.

571
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,500
Okay.

572
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,260
Changge.

573
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,260
I'll take you back to Chang'an.

574
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,460
It's not a good place to stay.

575
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,260
Changge,

576
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,860
I can't go back to Chang'an.

577
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,940
Grandfather asked me to stay in the prairie

578
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
and have a date with Ashile Tribe.

579
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,500
Okay.

580
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,540
But my father said

581
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,900
I was seriously ill

582
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,660
and asked me to go to Luoyang to recuperate.

583
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,460
Listen to your father.

584
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,060
Stay in Luoyang.

585
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,060
Changge,

586
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,340
I don't want to go anywhere.

587
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,700
I really want to go back to the past.

588
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,580
Where are you?

589
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,420
I can't go back.

590
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,420
Then...

591
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,580
Can we meet again in the future?

592
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,620
I said that lighting the fire was the only chance.

593
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,180
Do you think Brother Shuyu is saved?

594
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,460
I will definitely save Brother Shuyu.

595
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,900
Don't worry.

596
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,500
Go.

597
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,900
Nowadays,

598
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,700
young people are so eager to go on a journey.

599
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,260
By the way,

600
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,460
the city of Youzhou is sealed.

601
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,140
No one is allowed to leave the city.

602
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,340
It's getting late.

603
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,540
There is a post station ahead.

604
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,580
We can go there and rest.

605
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,500
It's natural to follow the trend.

606
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,300
It's hard to predict the future.

607
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,980
Right?

608
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,900
Susu.

609
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,260
Let's go.

610
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,300
Stop.

611
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,860
What are you doing?

612
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,180
The seal is here.

613
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,940
The special envoy of Chang'an, Wei Shuyu, wants to see you.

614
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,900
Let him go.

615
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,700
You said that Governor Li and General Wang have already taken the enemy.

616
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,180
What's the evidence?

617
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,340
The? who followed me

618
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,940
were all locked up in the dungeon of the Governor's mansion.

619
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,900
As long as the Commandant leads the army,

620
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,580
we can go there and check it out.

621
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,740
The army outside the city is not allowed to enter the city.

622
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,940
If there is no other evidence,

623
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,260
I'm sorry, but I can't go there.

624
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,380
But Wang Junkuo controlled the city.

625
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,060
If the army of Ashile Tribe is united,

626
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,860
Li Yuan will surrender Youzhou to us.

627
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,980
Then our country will be safe.

628
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,500
I'm telling the truth.

629
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,260
Please send the troops.

630
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,420
If I don't want to send the troops,

631
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,860
then please forgive us.

632
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,460
You are not the special envoy of Chang'an.

633
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,700
Tell me, who are you?

634
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,420
Governor.

635
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,020
Governor.

636
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,420
Y-Yan.

637
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,540
Yanyan?

638
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,260
The east gate had been lit up.

639
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,940
sooner or later, the army of Ashile Tribe will be souvenir of Li Long's вжеg что

640
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,260
as well as the life.

641
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,740
The central fire applicant wasign applause.

642
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,580
Congressman, please tell the troops to hurry up.

643
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:44,780
Go ahead.

644
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,100
Let's rally the army.

645
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:46,620
Yes.

646
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,080
I will surely see you soon.

647
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,500
Zhang Wei 눈 pierce his throat.

648
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,020
I do not understand anything at the moment.

649
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,320
If I had held hatred,

650
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,300
if I had not told then,

651
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,600
then my son would not have been

652
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,880
young and accursed.

653
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,900
You really want to see?

654
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
It's not a waste of time.

655
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,300
Take Wang Junkuo's token

656
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,100
and go out of the city.

657
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:56,700
Yes.

658
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,820
Stop.

659
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,340
Let's hide first.

660
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,180
We'll talk to them later.

661
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,980
Go.

662
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,780
Ashile Sun.

663
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,180
Don't go, Xiao Kehan.

664
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,700
There are many people in the enemy's camp.

665
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,540
It's hard to escape now.

666
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,500
Xiao Kehan has a special identity.

667
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,860
There must be no accident.

668
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,900
Let's go.

669
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,220
Go.

670
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,220
Go.

671
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,660
There seems to be someone hiding there.

672
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,260
Go and have a look.

673
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,940
Yes.

674
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,940
This is something in the Youzhou Office.

675
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,900
There must be something wrong in the city.

676
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,780
Send a message.

677
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,580
Speed up.

678
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,900
Before dawn,

679
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,220
we must reach the city of Youzhou.

680
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,420
Yes.

681
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,380
Don't think about the wine.

682
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,540
Or you can try.

683
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,780
See if you can shout faster

684
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,980
or my knife is faster.

685
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,020
He is still a child.

686
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,580
Don't scare him.

687
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,020
Su Su.

688
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,220
Don't be afraid.

689
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,260
It's okay.

690
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,020
Why hasn't anyone come back yet?

691
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,180
Can Changge really save Shuyu?

692
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,980
Su,

693
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,420
go and have a look.

694
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,460
Send a message.

695
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,940
Su Su.

696
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,100
Benjo Biomagnetic

697
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,460
Xueyi

698
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,020
Uncle, are you welcome?

699
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,660
Water.

700
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:50,780
Water?

701
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,940
Before saying goodbye,

702
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,940
I hope

703
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,940
I can remember your voice

704
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,940
and lock it into my tender dream

705
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Before dawn,

706
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,940
between the years,

707
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,940
my longing flows continuously

708
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,940
There is always a moment

709
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:54,940
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

710
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,940
There is always a moment

711
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
that is between you and me

712
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,940
and it is all in front of me

713
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,940
Before dawn,

714
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,940
between the years,

715
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,940
my longing flows continuously

716
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,940
There is always a moment

717
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:22,940
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

718
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,940
There is always a moment

719
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,940
that is between you and me

720
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,940
and it is all in front of me

721
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,940
Before dawn,

722
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,940
between the years,

723
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,940
my longing flows continuously

724
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,940
There is always a moment

725
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,940
that is between you and me

726
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Before dawn,

727
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,940
between the years,

728
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:58,940
my longing flows continuously

729
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,940
There is always a moment

730
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:09,940
that burns down the wastelands in my heart

731
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,940
There is always a moment
