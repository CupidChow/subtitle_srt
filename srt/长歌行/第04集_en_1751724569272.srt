1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The dream is a frost, the heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is frosty, the city is a dagger

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the light, the direction

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To forget you

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The memory is the shape of my stubbornness

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To look back at the past

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Lying on the river of life, not forgetting the past

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurry

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hurry up

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Did you find it?

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That way

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hurry

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You really escaped alive

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you here?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Since you want to take revenge

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You will definitely come to Hongyi Palace

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hongyi Palace is heavily guarded

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm afraid that you will encounter trouble

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I've been guarding here for two days and two nights

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look, I'm still useful

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Besides, the chicken feet in Chang'an City

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No one is more skilled than me

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Master, let me follow you

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Master, wait for me

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master, what is this?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not a good thing, don't ask

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Master said don't ask

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then I will never mention a word

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look, I'm so obedient

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Master, can you take me?

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Follow me and you will die

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Go back

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
People all have their own meaning

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Follow the path of the master to go to the heart

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think it's worth it

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are not afraid of death

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm afraid of death

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then you still follow me

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But, but

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The life of a dog is more terrible than death

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Master, you can laugh

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You look so good when you smile

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Since you want to die, don't blame me

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Master, he took me as his disciple

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hurry up

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm afraid that you will die

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm afraid that you will die

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hurry up

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What? He ran away?

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I didn't expect he was so fast

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This guy

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm getting more and more interested in him

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Tegin, this guy is not easy

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Dr. Su

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Does Li Jiancheng have a son or a general who escaped?

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
As far as I know, no

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Jiancheng has no son and no son

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The general is also a family

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That guy

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I guess he is a nobody in the Eastern Palace

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It seems that now

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We don't know how to leave Chang'an

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm guilty

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please allow me to transfer the troops

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And lock the city for three days

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will catch the princess

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will catch the fugitive

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And get the treasure back

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Fang Yi

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You have been with the prince for so many years

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why are you still talking nonsense?

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Commander Fang is catching the fugitive

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why did it become nonsense when he came to you?

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why don't you talk nonsense?

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Although the prince has been sent to the Imperial Academy

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Except for Feng Li and Xie Shufang

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The nobility in the court and the generals in the army

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are involved with Li Jiancheng

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Everyone is watching

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm afraid that the Imperial Academy is a chance to lure the snake out of the hole

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you lead the troops to lock the city at this time

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They don't know how to catch the water

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If you catch the water

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You will break the gate

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And all of you will run out of sight

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You will get hurt if you get angry

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The melon is not sweet

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you don't believe me, try it

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Try it

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Princess Yongan

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Since childhood, she has been timid and timid

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How dare she dare to act boldly

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If someone is not behind her

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To support her

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How dare she

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why are you looking at me?

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Those two princesses have been close to each other since childhood

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They went to visit each other

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They are also in love

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it possible that stealing the Crown Prince's wedding

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is also in love?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't say it

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Princess Yongning

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is more bold than I thought

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you still praising her?

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't talk nonsense

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This matter has nothing to do with me

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I won't support the princess to take the Crown Prince's wedding

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Stop arguing

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Leyan really shouldn't do this

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I punished her to close the door and think about it

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
As for Changge

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You order her to go down

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Call a team of elite soldiers

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Change into uniforms and secretly investigate

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Everything will be full of wind and rain

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Remember to bring her back alive

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Your Highness

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Princess Yongning is powerful in martial arts

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If she insists on arresting

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want her alive

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I want her alive

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will talk to her again

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This matter is not a joke

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't make a mistake

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I obey

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Lord Fang

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You just said that the officials in the capital are still in the official network

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you have a good plan?

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you know that the joy of the wedding is the heart?

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The Shangyang jade reformation law was established in the south gate

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A wooden head

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The person who moved to the north gate can get one billion gold

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Someone tried

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He really got the gold

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Since then, people have believed that the court is really strict

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's easy to say

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But where to find this wood?

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Isn't there a wooden head in the Yongxing room?

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Fight

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Godfather

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Godfather

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What happened?

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Your Highness is too kind

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm afraid that you will rebel

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Godfather, are you referring to Princess Yongning?

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Princess Yongning has always been close to you

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Everyone knows that the relationship between the two is better than the father

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't do anything

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's also in the process

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Foolish

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This Li Changge

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Since childhood, he has been treated as a prince

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
A cultured and fierce teacher

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Since childhood, he has been flying and domineering

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He just got out of the line

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ordinary people must have a golden soul

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He also planned to commit the crime of assassinating the royal court

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have been thinking about it these days

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm afraid that the rumors in the army

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It has nothing to do with him

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you don't go out, it's the root

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In the future, I will be in trouble

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am already late

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But the crown prince ordered

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't hurt his life

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
As long as the crown prince has a good name

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It doesn't matter what my reputation is

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you can protect my Tang dynasty

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let my Tang dynasty be stable

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ten eight Li Changge

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Also kill him

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What does the adoptive father mean?

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This matter

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I only entrust it to you to rest assured

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You will let me down

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will not let the adoptive father go

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
By the way, you ask Changhe

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How is the rumor investigation going?

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If there is no progress

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tell me to give up

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Marquis

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The adoptive father called me over

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Asked you about the rumor

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How is the investigation going?

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Still investigating

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Please tell Mr. Du

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Once there is news

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I will report it immediately

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
According to your investigation

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm afraid I won't be able to find the culprit next year

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Show me the note

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How can there be a fishy smell?

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Marquis

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I am just a common fish

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Doing small business

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know what happened

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know what happened

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Stop talking nonsense

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Say it

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Who ordered you

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Put the note in the fish's stomach

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't understand what the lord said

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If you don't tell the truth

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You can't go back

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Lord, please forgive me

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That man just gave me a string of money

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I touched the feet in the fish's stomach

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know that person

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know the words

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then you should know that it is a man and a woman

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's fat and thin

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I remember

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a man

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But a man with a bright future

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There is no wise young man

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, no

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's a big man

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a little less

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But there are no other features

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't continue to count

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Please forgive me, Lord

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Master

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go south after eating

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The patrols in the south

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's definitely not as busy as here

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can think of it

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They must be able to think of it

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't eat

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Go quickly

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
it is good

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't look around

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All of them are from the Qin's Mansion

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
After the split

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We will meet in the Jiusi in Yining Fang

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There is

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Run after

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Stop

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Step aside

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't run

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Step aside

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What happened

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There is a fish in front of the fish

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's go and see

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Fish

260
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Fish

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tegin

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Tegin

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Tegin, bad news

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That fish was caught by the government

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now it is at the intersection of Zhuque Street

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The price is heavy

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That fish has seen Su Yishe

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Will he give us out

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Everyone on the street

270
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Leave now

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
why

272
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You exposed

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
How can it be

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Shouldn't

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If they really caught the clue

276
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why should you be on the street

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Since they will do this

278
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It must be that there is no useful clue

279
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Will send someone to secretly observe the reaction of the visitors

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When you came back from the street

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Should have been followed

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Tegin

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I should go

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I should go

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Too late

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They are already here

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What to do

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Chase

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's go

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Step aside

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Step aside

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Step aside

293
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Step aside

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How can I meet you in the big city?

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You dare to come with me?

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You came at the right time.

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Go down.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hurry up.

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Go.

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Chang He?

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why did he change to his position?

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Go.

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Chase.

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Go up and have a look.

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Commander Feng.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
General Chang.

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Are you also chasing Princess Yongning?

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Princess Yongning?

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No one.

312
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I saw her running into this road.

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
General Chang.

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Did you see her?

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We chased her for a long time, but we didn't catch her.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I didn't see Princess Yongning.

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Go over there and have a look.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Tegin.

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Thanks to you this time.

320
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I will pay attention next time.

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You are fine.

322
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's really great.

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
God bless you.

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Are you stupid?

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
All right.

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Dr. Su.

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I asked you to find the way out of the city.

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Did you find it?

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Tegin, don't worry.

330
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I have found one.

331
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Go.

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
General Chang is really stupid.

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He even lost the duck in his mouth.

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That man is good at martial arts and is very good at chess.

335
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He got rid of him.

336
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I found it.

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But I found this.

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Fang Yi is chasing Princess Yongning.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If I guess it right,

340
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
this fish suit is on her.

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I didn't expect to lose a fish and lose a fish.

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's you.

343
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you recognize this?

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mr. Hao is right.

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I know you and Li Changge have been childhood friends.

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think you know him best.

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
As the saying goes,

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
know yourself and know yourself.

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

350
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You want me to go catch Li Changge?

351
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Please tell the governor.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Everything else can be discussed.

353
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But this matter is difficult for me to do.

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you know Li Changge's fish suit

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
is yours?

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Stealing Crown Prince's seal,

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
assassinating the Crown Prince,

358
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
committing crimes,

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Crown Prince's seal is lost.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The pig's wine is enough.

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay.

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I know where Li Changge is going next.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you figure it out,

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
come to me anytime.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll go.

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
A'Dou, I've figured it out.

367
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you want to leave the city

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and don't let the guards investigate me,

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
there's only one way.

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's me, not me.

371
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What do you mean by master?

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A'Dou, do you have a way

373
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to fake identity and ID?

374
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Fake identity and ID?

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Master,

376
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know how to fake identity and ID,

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
but I know how to do business.

378
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There are so many businessmen in Chang'an City.

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
They come and go.

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,720
They are all

381
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
easy to find.

382
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll take care of this.

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Be careful.

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, sir.

385
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What do you want?

386
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The shop's sections

387
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
are the most complete in Chang'an City.

388
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
East exit, Canghai Head.

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
West exit, Yumen Pass.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,560
100,000

391
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,000
yuan for the waist-wrapping.

392
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What are you talking about?

393
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Master, this is an excuse.

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

395
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The last amount of money

396
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
has been lost.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Lost?

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So it's gone?

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's a business section.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You should go and see if you're lucky.

401
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's go.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Sir,

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
can you take us out of the city?

404
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No.

405
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I have an emergency.

406
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why are you here?

407
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Normally, the businessmen will always carry some goods.

408
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're not clean either.

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If you don't want to be accused,

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
talk to me about business.

411
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I heard that the King of Qin is arresting the remaining criminals of the Eastern Palace.

412
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You have to behead them.

413
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You think

414
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm the one who's afraid of being accused?

415
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How do you know?

416
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was right.

417
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Why are you here?

418
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Be quiet.

419
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You want to attract everyone here, right?

420
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You idiot.

421
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

422
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You can't stay in Chang'an City anymore?

423
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Since we're all from the same way,

424
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
it's convenient for us to invite the King of Qin.

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But have you ever thought

426
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that in case you're recognized,

427
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
all my brothers in the business team

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
will be killed?

429
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You're a big trouble.

430
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We have no friendship.

431
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
How can I help you?

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The business team has many cars.

433
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They won't investigate it.

434
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
As long as you give me a place to hide,

435
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
if they find out that it's me,

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll say that I hid it myself.

437
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It has nothing to do with you.

438
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When you met Ma Chishi yesterday,

439
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if you're as polite as you are now,

440
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I might have agreed.

441
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I have some emergency things to do.

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're being honest.

444
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If you really want to apologize,

445
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
just forget it.

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't have any common items

447
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that I can exchange with you.

448
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I think this knife is good.

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This knife is not good.

450
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Then it's free.

451
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go.

452
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Master, let's go out of the city first.

453
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
After we leave the city,

454
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yanzhi will not have a chance to take it back.

455
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay.

456
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll exchange with you.

457
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I have to wait until I leave the city smoothly.

458
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Deal.

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
A'Dou,

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
you don't have to take risks with me.

461
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The soldiers won't investigate you.

462
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You go to the city's city hall first.

463
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If I don't arrive within three days,

464
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
it's you and me.

465
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But master, you're alone.

466
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You've called me master.

467
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You still don't listen to me.

468
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I...

469
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay.

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Then master,

471
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you must be careful.

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll go.

473
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll go.

474
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll go.

475
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Go.

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Do you think

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the guy who Tegin met in the Eastern Palace

478
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
seems to have a lot to say?

479
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Didn't Tegin say

480
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that the enemy of the enemy is a friend?

481
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Since he's a friend,

482
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
shouldn't he say a few more words?

483
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It makes sense.

484
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's go.

485
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Sirs,

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
this is...

487
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Did this person

488
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
come to the city to search for a way out?

489
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Sir, you're joking.

490
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We're serious.

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You see it clearly.

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No.

493
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He came here.

494
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Later, a business team passed by.

495
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He went to find that business team.

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Go.

497
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Hurry up.

498
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Wait.

499
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sir,

500
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
we passed by.

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We passed by.

502
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's the same as the goods registered above.

503
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Let's go.

504
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you, sir.

505
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let's go.

506
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Wait.

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Take it.

508
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Give me the lock.

509
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Sir,

510
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I've searched it just now.

511
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
There's nothing wrong.

512
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, I've checked it just now.

513
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Is there nothing wrong?

514
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
These are

515
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
ordinary herbs

516
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and not made of leather.

517
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
anders

518
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
sauce

519
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
investigations

520
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,240
Chair

521
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The abducting bag

522
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
has been found body.

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Nõ

524
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Why do you have to cut off my way?

525
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Can we go now?

526
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Okay, we can go now. Let's go.

527
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Go.

528
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Commander, we've searched everywhere.

529
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But we still haven't found him.

530
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think he's out of town.

531
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What should we do now?

532
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No matter what he does,

533
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
if he wants to go far away,

534
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
he will definitely pass by.

535
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We'll send troops right away.

536
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But I'll go stop him.

537
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And bring Uncle Wei back.

538
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes.

539
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Go.

540
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I deserve to die.

541
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What are you doing?

542
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Your Highness,

543
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I failed to fulfill your request.

544
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But Changge did such a thing.

545
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
She hit you.

546
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm guilty.

547
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You're cunning and weak.

548
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I blame Ke Ming for not taking you into consideration.

549
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's my idea to let you take responsibility.

550
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Now Changge has escaped.

551
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I can't blame him.

552
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Are you trying to mock me?

553
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You know your own fault.

554
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I dare not.

555
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's all my fault.

556
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay, get up.

557
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Don't pretend to be a fool.

558
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't blame you.

559
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I didn't expect a girl

560
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
to be so cunning.

561
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Your Highness,

562
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the Crown Prince is in a big position.

563
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Changge has caused a big trouble this time.

564
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Don't mind it.

565
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Take the road to the palace.

566
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Someone is waiting for us.

567
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes, yes, yes.

568
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll go prepare now.

569
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Come.

570
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
What's wrong with you?

571
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Why are you with Du...

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Why are you with Du Dou?

573
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Pseudocon.

574
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What?

575
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I told you before you went in.

576
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The consequences are unbearable.

577
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Are you going to hide in this box?

578
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
No.

579
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
They will check the goods when they leave the city.

580
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But they won't check the body.

581
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Then,

582
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
you just need to wrap me under this fur

583
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and put me between two bees.

584
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I have a better place to hide.

585
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I will never be found.

586
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You can try.

587
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But

588
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
the consequences are unbearable.

589
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Why are you like a girl?

590
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Do you want to buy some from us?

591
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It can be cheaper for you.

592
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What?

593
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You shameless bitch.

594
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You...

595
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The medicine is ready.

596
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
No need to thank me.

597
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Since you have already agreed

598
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
to leave the city,

599
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
this dagger is mine.

600
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Wait.

601
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
May I ask your name?

602
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We met by chance.

603
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I won't see you again.

604
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I will teach you how to keep this dagger.

605
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I will definitely get it back in the future.

606
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm really scared if you don't tell me your name.

607
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Su Yishe.

608
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Leave him a horse.

609
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

610
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I will compensate for a horse.

611
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
This deal is already worth it.

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Don't waste it.

613
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Let's go.

614
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Go.

615
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Thank you for your horse.

616
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But I will still get my stuff back.

617
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Xian Cheng.

618
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm here again.

619
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm sick.

620
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't want to see anyone.

621
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Get out.

622
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You're still mad at me?

623
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Last time,

624
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I didn't even get to drink a cup of tea

625
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that I didn't like.

626
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Today, I'm just like that.

627
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The tea for the horse is really bitter.

628
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Perfect.

629
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Today, I brought you a person

630
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
who can cure your illness.

631
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Your Highness.

632
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The King of Han

633
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Mr. Wei is still unwell.

634
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The citizens came to visit.

635
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Go.

636
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Brother Yuchang.

637
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We really have a fate.

638
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The person who cured me with him

639
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
was you.

640
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Brother Cheng.

641
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Wei Shuyu.

642
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You are indeed a good friend of the Princess.

643
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You knew right away that she would die.

644
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Thank you for notifying me in time.

645
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Go.

646
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Chase.

647
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Go.

648
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Stop.

649
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Go.

650
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Brother Li Chang.

651
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You have no way to escape.

652
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hurry and turn around.

653
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Wait for me to return and ask for forgiveness.

654
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Go.

655
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Go.

656
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Go.

657
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Go.

658
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Go.

659
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Go.

660
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What's wrong?

661
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Are you sad?

662
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Don't pretend that you are being used by me.

663
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Since you came here,

664
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
why don't you just make your choice?

665
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I don't have time to waste time on you.

666
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
If you want to clean up for her,

667
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
hurry and go down.

668
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Brother Cheng.

669
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The people came here

671
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to ask for Mr. Wei's leave.

672
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Zheng

673
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
has a heart like a rock.

674
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Prince Qin,

675
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
please return.

676
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Mr. Wei,

677
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
if you don't want to leave,

678
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
you can return.

679
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But,

680
00:39:42,000 --> 00:40:04,040
So are you going to be a

681
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,240
朵

682
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
to go to Chang'an and see my brother

683
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,720
I'm talking about my brother

684
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,520
Back then

685
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,480
I didn't tell the crown prince

686
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,840
so I didn't get the truth

687
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,520
Get out

688
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,240
Get out

689
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't come back

690
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,080
One of the users

691
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,080
will definitely meet you

692
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,400
I'm afraid

693
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,560
once this matter got to state

694
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,640
you could face the end of the world

695
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,160
My king

696
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,680
Your majesty

697
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,800
Lord Zheng

698
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,240
When I was pinned to death

699
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
with hisimes

700
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,280
I, Lan Вazlü

701
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,440
Please wait and see.

702
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,000
What are you doing?

703
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,560
Don't stop me.

704
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,880
Get out. Get out.

705
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,400
Gu Chong Chen is a man of his word.

706
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,800
I'll be waiting for you here.

707
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,440
Tegin, the water is ready.

708
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,120
Dr. Su and Nuer went to the road ahead.

709
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,080
They've found the person who helped us.

710
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,440
They'll go back to the grassland with the team.

711
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,160
But according to our current plan,

712
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,000
we should be there in half a month.

713
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,400
Half a month?

714
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,760
It's too long.

715
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,400
We have to hurry.

716
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,400
Yes.

717
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,080
Yes.

718
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
In the dream

719
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Before dawn

720
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Before the years

721
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,280
The longing flows constantly

722
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,280
There is always a moment

723
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Burn the wastelands in my heart

724
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,280
There is always a longing

725
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
In the past

726
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Between you and me

727
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
Everything

728
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
In each other's world

729
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
In different worlds

730
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,280
I am always missing you

731
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Over the years

732
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Became eternity

733
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,280
The cocoon of the night sky

734
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,280
There is always a moment

735
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,280
Burn the wastelands in my heart

736
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
There is always a longing

737
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Between you and me

738
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Everything

739
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
In each other's world

740
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
In different worlds

741
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,280
I am always missing you

742
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Over the years

743
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Became eternity

744
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,280
The cocoon of the night sky

745
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Immortal

746
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,280
The cocoon of the night sky
