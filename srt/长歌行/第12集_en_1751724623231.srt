1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The dream is a frost, the heart is boiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To the distance

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The past is frosty and cold

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This broken wing

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Still have to fly

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To forget you

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Memories are like a stronghold

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Climbing the river of life, never forget the madness

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Legend of Chusen

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The commander of the military is here.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He ordered me to collect Gongsun Heng's military uniform.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where is the military uniform?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hurry and bring it to me.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The bandits are coming so fast.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hurry.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please be more practical.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hurry and move aside.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't force your brothers to act rashly.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is the private property of my Gongsun family.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Not the Shuozhou government.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do you want to collect? What do you want to do?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't be the master of a woman's family.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't wait for my husband to come back.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
To give you an answer.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Madam, you should cooperate.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you hand over the thing earlier,

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You can clear the suspect of the governor earlier.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your family can also reunite earlier.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Gongsun's governor is now under pressure.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is the result?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The decision is all up to the general.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
At this time,

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Please don't come to our front.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What a coincidence.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Gongsun Heng won the battle and won half of the city.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My wife's family is used to seeing soldiers with him.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your few words of goodwill

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can't scare me.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Then don't blame my wife for being rude.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Who? Who is standing there?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you have something to say,

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't be rude in front of my master.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The governor is not here.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The wife can't be the master.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you have something, just come to me.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You old man, can you be the master?

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My master is in your hands.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You have to do it.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Madam, if you can trust the old man,

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Leave it to me.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please go back to the interior to look after Yuanniang.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you, sir.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Everyone, follow me.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is bad.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is bad.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is bad.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The house is being robbed.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Nonsense.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How can the governor's house be robbed?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What kind of joke is this?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The loss of property in the house has not been counted.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But the governor's uncle and the account book are very seriously damaged.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you want to reduce the loss,

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have to immediately lead the army to chase the thief.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Enough, stop talking.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You don't know the rules.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is the guard of the Si Ma's general.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hurry up and stand up.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The guard of the Si Ma's general is here.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Please don't be rude.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Guard Wang, please help me get rid of the thief.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The guard of the Wang's general is here.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please help me chase the thief immediately.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Joke.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The thief from the governor's mansion has nothing to do with me.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hurry up and hand over the military uniform.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Military uniform.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The military uniform is in the governor's study.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is bad.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Where is the study?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's there.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Go.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Qin.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is really a thief.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Search.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What should I do?

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is...

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is...

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is...

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is...

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is...

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is...

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Guard Wang, we didn't find the military uniform.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't play tricks on me.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't care if the military uniform was stolen by the thief.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Within three days,

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
if we can't hand over the military uniform,

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the entire governor's mansion will be in chaos.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How did Mr. Qin know they would come?

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sima Tu has been forcing the governor to hand over the military uniform.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This time, he detained the governor

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
to get the military uniform.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm just doing this to return the military uniform.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What should we do now?

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Should we hand over the military uniform?

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you think that Sima Tu can transfer the military horse

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to Shuozhou with the military uniform?

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can try to go to the camp with the military uniform

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and see if those soldiers will listen to you.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How can they say that?

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't the soldiers in Shuozhou listen to the token?

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Not only the military uniform,

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
even the emperor's son's jade seal

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
can't transfer a soldier's family to Shuozhou.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If they want to get the jade seal,

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
they can do it willingly.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not just the four objects.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Only the governor and Sun Kang.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mr. Qin.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mr. Qin.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Any news?

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sima Tu sent someone to open the mansion.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They want to get the wealth of the family

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and make peace with the Ashile Army.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We can't let the governor in.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He will only kill himself.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The governor is now in prison.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He can't command the army.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What should we do now?

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We can just go in there

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and save the governor.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You want to take soldiers to the prison?

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are so scared.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can't save the governor

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but you can put Shuozhou in danger.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The governor sent you to the mansion as his assistant.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I hope the governor won't see it.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I didn't expect Mr. Qin to be a little bit smart.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He is walking around.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He can't even walk steadily.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He is smart.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right, master?

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Master.

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Master.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What are you thinking?

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I am thinking how to save the governor.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We can choose thousands of soldiers

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and put the governor in prison.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will go there in person.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You are so annoying.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We are new to Shuozhou.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We don't know much about it.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Even Mr. Qin can't do anything.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Gongsun Heng trusts me so much.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How can I not save him?

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How can I not save him?

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What else can we do except for robbing the car?

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We can't kill Si Maotu.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have an idea.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master, where are you going?

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am going to find Qin.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You know I will come.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You must have come up with some plan.

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Time is limited.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Tell me.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have an idea.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I need to call someone.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Tell me.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I need some reinforcements from the governor's home.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I will go there in person.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is too risky.

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We are not good at it.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We lost the whole game.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But now,

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we have no choice.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Master didn't see you wrong.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He guessed he might be trapped

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
before he went to the governor's house.

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He ordered me to give you this

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
when the time is right.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I will give you this.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I will not let you down.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What do you want me to do?

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Tell me.

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I want some reliable reinforcements

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
from the governor's home.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I want them to come to my house.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But I want to tell you.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I am not helping you.

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I am doing this for the governor.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Master.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Aren't you going to discuss with Mr. Qin?

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why did he leave?

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have the result.

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What result?

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The governor left me a note.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What note?

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's the heart.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I finally know

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
what the old lady said.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's time for the act.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's go.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm from the mini- politics of Song.

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
General Guo.

219
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
We want to ask you to help us

220
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,720
and break through the trap together.

221
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
The headquarters only has orders.

222
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,680
As long as we can stop the city

223
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,040
and bring back Governor Gongsun,

224
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
we will do our best.

225
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,400
In that case,

226
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,480
I'll be polite.

227
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
How many Qingqis are there in the city?

228
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Six thousand.

229
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,080
General Zhang Hui and I

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,040
lead three thousand each.

231
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Then send out a thousand soldiers.

232
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,960
General Guo will command

233
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,240
to split the city into two groups.

234
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,960
At half past ten every day,

235
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,600
they will disturb the city

236
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
and the Ashile Tribe's camp.

237
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
Once they attack,

238
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
they will retreat immediately.

239
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,520
Don't lose a single soldier.

240
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,800
Yes.

241
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,160
What about me?

242
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,040
What should I do?

243
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
I need General Zhang Hui

244
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,360
to secretly send out some people

245
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
to the city.

246
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,080
They will fight in the mountains

247
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,720
in the northwest and northeast.

248
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
They will fight with the army in the city.

249
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,200
There are only 30,000 soldiers in the city.

250
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
It's not a big deal to guard the city.

251
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
Why should we send soldiers out of the city?

252
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,640
If something happens in the peace talks,

253
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,360
the soldiers led by General Zhang Hui

254
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,640
can be used as an excuse.

255
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,600
They can be used as a warning.

256
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,560
I see.

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,920
Don't worry, Master.

258
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,600
We will

259
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
arrange it well

260
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,600
before the city is opened.

261
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,920
Thank you, General.

262
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,160
Master,

263
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
a little trick

264
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,320
can really move thousands of soldiers.

265
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,520
It's not a trick

266
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,480
that can move thousands of soldiers.

267
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
It's human nature.

268
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,520
Master, you're not good at this.

269
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm afraid the governor's office

270
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
will be accompanied by it.

271
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,840
There are troubles in the court.

272
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,280
This is the only way

273
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,880
I can think of

274
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,320
to get the heart of the people.

275
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,800
By the way, Master Qin,

276
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,160
can you find a place

277
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,200
to hide from me?

278
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,320
Except you and Xu Feng,

279
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,800
you can't let others know.

280
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,720
All right.

281
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm willing to read the governor's judgment.

282
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,160
I hope he's right.

283
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,400
Come with me.

284
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
There's a secret room in the mansion.

285
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,600
Come on.

286
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,800
May I ask your name?

287
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,360
We just met.

288
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,760
We won't meet again.

289
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,960
You said we would be friends?

290
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Aren't we friends now?

291
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,760
The prairie?

292
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,560
I don't know the place.

293
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,160
Let's not meet again.

294
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
You know me?

295
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,480
What's wrong?

296
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,720
Sun,

297
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,520
since you came back from Tang,

298
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,200
you've been acting like a different person.

299
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,360
You're still smiling when you're free.

300
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,840
But you're smiling so...

301
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,360
like a human.

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,280
Are you hiding something from me?

303
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,120
Nothing.

304
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,040
Ashile Sun,

305
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
do you like

306
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
any Tang Emperor?

307
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not a Tang Emperor.

308
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,320
I'm a man.

309
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm a man.

310
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm a man.

311
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm a man.

312
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm a man.

313
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm a man.

314
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,240
Do you like any Tang girl?

315
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,600
God bless us.

316
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,240
Sun is finally free.

317
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,640
Are you free to do nothing?

318
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,200
Don't talk to me about this.

319
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
Just tell me if I'm right.

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,640
Yes.

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Useless.

322
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
Hurry up.

323
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,560
Help!

324
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
Hurry up.

325
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,720
Hurry up.

326
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
Help!

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Help!

328
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Hurry up.

329
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,760
What's wrong?

330
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,040
Tegin.

331
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,800
Didn't you say Gongsun Heng was arrested?

332
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,600
I...

333
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,400
Where did the night attack come from?

334
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,280
I...

335
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,440
I'm sorry.

338
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm sorry.

339
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,680
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm sorry.

343
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,560
I...

344
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,440
I...

345
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,480
Report!

346
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,840
Tegin.

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
Tang's men have set fire to our food.

348
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,120
Have you saved them?

349
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,280
Go to save me if you're set on fire.

350
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,880
Why did you help me?

351
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,720
Yes.

352
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,200
What's the use of helping me?

353
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,400
Go!

354
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,680
You'd better tell me.

355
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
Or I'll kill you first.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,320
And then we'll take Shuozhou.

357
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,280
Yes.

358
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,160
I'll go to the Four Seas Map now.

359
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Go now!

360
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
What did you find?

361
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,840
The Bear Division has set fire to our food.

362
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,920
They're setting fire to our food.

363
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,840
We only set fire to a few tents.

364
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
It's fine.

365
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,520
These two are like flies to me.

366
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,600
They want to kill me.

367
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,040
But they can't catch me.

368
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,680
But it's funny.

369
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,560
The Bear Division is always unlucky.

370
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,040
They should be more careful.

371
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,960
What are you thinking?

372
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,680
Gongsun Heng has been in the army for ten years.

373
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,480
He's always been unruly.

374
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
He's really abnormal.

375
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,640
It seems that

376
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
there are masters in Shuozhou.

377
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,720
Masters?

378
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,520
It's said that there's a secret passage.

379
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,880
There's something like this under the Four Seas Map?

380
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,040
This should be the secret room

381
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
left by the Qian Sui period.

382
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
It's not bad.

383
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
A'Dou.

384
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,600
You must remember every word I say now.

385
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,520
From now on,

386
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
you must remember every word

387
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
and every word you hear here.

388
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,240
You can't tell others.

389
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,040
Do you remember?

390
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

391
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,640
Although I still don't understand it,

392
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,760
since you're a master,

393
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,440
I'll do as you say.

394
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Little Head.

395
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,400
How is it?

396
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,600
Are there any casualties in the army?

397
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,320
None of them were injured.

398
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,800
We'll follow the plan and fight them.

399
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
It's good if we fight them.

400
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,280
They're repeatedly attacked.

401
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,680
They're so angry and sleepy.

402
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,280
If this continues,

403
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,920
they'll be tired of fighting.

404
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,000
We've achieved our goal.

405
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
We should change the plan.

406
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,080
What plan?

407
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,920
But this plan

408
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
will be hard on you.

409
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,480
Chief.

410
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,360
Chief.

411
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,120
I told you not to come here.

412
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,040
Why did you...

413
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,880
If you change your mind,

414
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,760
you shouldn't surrender.

415
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,880
Then I'll go back to Tegin.

416
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,400
If you have any consequences,

417
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,200
please take it on yourself.

418
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,800
The Shuozhou Office is calculating.

419
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,880
In less than two days,

420
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
we'll have the surrender order.

421
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,640
How can we let Tegin do that?

422
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,640
Our camp is being attacked

423
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
by the Shuozhou Army.

424
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,320
The whole army is in a panic.

425
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,800
They're all in a panic.

426
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,360
Is this the sincerity

427
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,200
of your brother Yi He?

428
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,920
How could this happen?

429
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,200
Brother has four military forces.

430
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,040
Gongsun Heng is in your hands now.

431
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
If you don't know,

432
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
will I believe you?

433
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,200
Gongsun Heng is in my prison.

434
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,400
He's a man of his word.

435
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,880
He has no chance of commanding me.

436
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Brother.

437
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,240
It's said that a few days ago,

438
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,040
Gongsun Heng's military uniform was knocked down by a thief.

439
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Now it seems that

440
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,640
the thief must have been the one who knocked down the ghost.

441
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,080
These days,

442
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,360
my men have guarded this place.

443
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
All my family members are here.

444
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,040
I'll send Wang Li

445
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,840
and the whole city to find him.

446
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,760
I'll find him as well.

447
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,040
In that case,

448
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
I'll do you another favor.

449
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,000
I already know the whereabouts of this thief.

450
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,560
It seems that the General Manager's Mansion

451
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,640
has been guarded by someone.

452
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,520
Brother, have you noticed it?

453
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Did Gongsun Heng ask you to do this?

454
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
I knew that Gongsun Heng

455
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,160
has been hiding the evil intentions

456
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,560
and plotting against the ghosts.

457
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Come on.

458
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Take him away.

459
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,320
Brother.

460
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,200
Leave him to me.

461
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,120
I promise to make him beg for life

462
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
and death.

463
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,560
Go to the prison.

464
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,760
I'll return you to your hometownaway a few어서

465
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,200
if you've managed to catch a wrong person.

466
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,480
Sentimental Dream

467
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,400
It's fine now.

468
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,960
You can't die.

469
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,680
It's not easy to live.

470
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,560
You...

471
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,440
You bastard!

472
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,960
So you just won't tell me?

473
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,200
Are you sure you'll only take these people with you tomorrow?

474
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,680
The dangerous army of Mount Shuozhou is everywhere.

475
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,280
No one has been attacked.

476
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,920
Gongsun Heng is a man of his word.

477
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,600
He's never taken any precautions.

478
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,360
These people are enough.

479
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,120
Just now, Chi Hou came to help.

480
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
The military counselor of the Central Plains, Xiong Shi,

481
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,840
went to Shuozhou City again tonight.

482
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm afraid that tomorrow,

483
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
the story of Na Xiang is fake,

484
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,880
and the story of Gong Cheng is true.

485
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,840
If the story of Gong Cheng is true,

486
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,280
it's a good chance to cooperate with us.

487
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,400
But the head of the Li's Department of Shuozhou

488
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,840
will definitely not sit idly by.

489
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
I wonder if this Tu Kashe

490
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,960
can handle it.

491
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
Head of the Li's Department?

492
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,360
I've checked.

493
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,440
He's the new head of the Shuozhou Department.

494
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,560
He's from the outside.

495
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,840
He hasn't been here for a few days.

496
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,160
Xu Feng.

497
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,720
It's not good to show up.

498
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,840
It's exposed.

499
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,640
The target has found out.

500
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,960
The target has found out.

501
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,800
The target has found out.

502
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,920
He took half a night to escape.

503
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,520
He's been around for hours.

504
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,080
He's definitely not afraid of being followed.

505
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,440
Forget it.

506
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,840
You go down and heal yourself.

507
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,280
The banner is inside.

508
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,640
You...

509
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,560
I said...

510
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
Is that right?

511
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,400
I know where the Li's Department is.

512
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
I can take you to find them.

513
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,160
I know

514
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,920
where they are hiding.

515
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,360
I won't run away.

516
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,120
Good.

517
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,680
If you catch the head of the Li's Department,

518
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,560
you'll be rewarded.

519
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
If you run away,

520
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
you should know what will happen.

521
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,440
Is this the Li's Department?

522
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,960
Is that right?

523
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,920
Those who know the truth are the best.

524
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,760
Kill him.

525
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,240
Kill him.

526
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,800
Come on.

527
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,840
I didn't expect

528
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,240
you to be so cruel.

529
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,760
Okay.

530
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,000
I like it.

531
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,120
Kill him.

532
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,000
Kill him.

533
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,200
You're here to congratulate Yibukan?

534
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,360
I've ordered the Li's Department to handle it.

535
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,640
The gift list is ready.

536
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,560
The whole Shuozhou is ours.

537
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,920
Why do you need this?

538
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,120
I'll reward you with the bonus.

539
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,120
Thank you, Si Qin.

540
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Thank you, Si Qin.

541
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,880
Let's go.

542
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,680
The military counselor said

543
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,360
he has handled the Li's Department.

544
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,280
The gift list is ready.

545
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
What's the name of the Li's Department?

546
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,840
I don't know the exact name.

547
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,840
Is your Shisi Lang also named Li?

548
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,120
Li?

549
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,480
There are so many people with the same last name.

550
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
It shouldn't be your Shisi Lang.

551
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,200
Find a team of people to follow Tukash.

552
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,120
Don't let him die.

553
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,360
Got it.

554
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,160
You've done it.

555
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,640
The commander Simatu

556
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,080
Tem edges the superior Di Biao

557
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,520
in the city on behalf of the governor of Shuozhou.

558
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,920
Lord Ashile

559
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,040
for the virtue of living.

560
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,440
I will sacrifice my life for it.

561
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,560
I'm grateful and grateful to you, Huai De.

562
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,000
Bring me the money.

563
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,920
This is the gift for you and His Majesty.

564
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,360
Please have a look.

565
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,600
OK.

566
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,560
Go.

567
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,160
How could this happen?

568
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,400
He didn't die.

569
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,640
Is it a surrender or not?

570
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
What do you mean?

571
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,120
You're trying to ambush me?

573
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,800
Let me explain.

574
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,160
You don't know how to drink.

575
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,800
I don't.

576
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,920
Move.

577
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I'll kill you.

578
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,080
No.

579
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,240
There's a change in the city.

580
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,720
Warriors.

581
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Tang army is not patient.

582
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
Don't blame us for being ungrateful.

583
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,640
Come on.

584
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,680
Attack.

585
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:15,000
Kill.

586
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,480
Kill.

587
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,560
Kill

588
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,040
Shoot

589
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,240
Go!

590
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,440
The Qi army is 5,000 people.

591
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,640
Let's get them all to the river.

592
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,880
Qi,

593
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,200
Gongsun Heng's main force is leading the battle.

594
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
They set up an ambush.

595
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
We don't have enough people.

596
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,960
Let's retreat to the river

597
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,160
and meet with the army first.

598
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,280
Didn't you say

599
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,520
Gongsun Heng was captured

600
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,720
and his army was dead?

601
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,720
I...

602
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,520
Stop the attack!

603
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,680
Retreat!

604
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,520
Those who don't know the plan of the Marquis

605
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,520
can't meet with the army.

606
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,160
Those who don't know the mountain forest's danger

607
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,320
and the punishment of the punishment

608
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,480
can't march.

609
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,680
Next,

610
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,800
let's depend on General Guo.

611
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,960
Yes.

612
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,880
The marches are to fight in front of the formation.

613
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,480
The army can't be without a commander.

614
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,320
The highest position in Shuozhou

615
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,880
must be replaced by the highest position.

616
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,560
Yes.

617
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,440
I'll go to pick up the Master now.

618
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,720
You're right, Sima Jian.

619
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,760
The water is dry in July.

620
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,360
It's convenient for us to march.

621
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,720
Brothers,

622
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,360
hurry up!

623
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
When we enter Shuozhou,

624
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,360
that's our world!

625
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
What do you want?

626
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,120
Go.

627
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,400
Siqi, help!

628
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,480
Tang Bing is ambushed!

629
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
They're chasing us!

630
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,080
Tegin.

631
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,880
Remind me.

632
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,360
Attack Shuozhou.

633
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,760
If you don't leave Li Chu to me,

634
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,920
I'll kill him myself!

635
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Tegin.

636
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,240
They stopped attacking.

637
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,920
Come on!

638
00:33:48,280 --> 00:34:09,720
Come!

639
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,960
Fall, fallahaha

640
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,440
Hurry up

641
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,320
This time I really have to thank Master Li

642
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,720
So you never momentarily

643
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,360
Go

644
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,080
Hurry up

645
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,080
rain

646
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,080
Take Go

647
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,120
Take

648
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,040
Matrix

649
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,600
So

650
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,700
I expect

651
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,320
It is

652
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,760
If it wasn't for you,

653
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,240
I'm afraid Shuozhou City would be in danger.

654
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,600
You're good at planning.

655
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,000
You used the Bear Division to kill Sima Tu.

656
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,080
But I have a question.

657
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,800
Why did you expect

658
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,240
Bear Division to attack the city?

659
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,880
Sima Tu is afraid of death.

660
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,880
This time, the alliance with Ashile Tribe

661
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,400
is just to lure wolves into the city

662
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
and make a fool of the tiger.

663
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,040
Ashile Tribe's ambition

664
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,640
is not only to take over the goods.

665
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,760
They want to use this alliance

666
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,080
to attack the city

667
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,800
to satisfy their wolf's ambition.

668
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,120
I'm just a pushover

669
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,720
who can kill people with a sword.

670
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,360
I see.

671
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,040
If we succeed this time,

672
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,400
Xu Feng will be very successful.

673
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
If Xu Feng hadn't cooperated with me

674
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,440
to play this trick,

675
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm afraid he wouldn't have easily

676
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,040
fooled Sima Tu.

677
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:42,260
It's just a little bit of a

678
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,540
I'm impressed that

679
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,220
the head of the tribe has just come to Shuozhou

680
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,540
to take care of the personal safety.

681
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,300
But I still have a question.

682
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,540
If I stab the head of the tribe's chest

683
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
one more time,

684
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,300
I'm afraid I'll pierce my blood

685
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,380
and stab my heart.

686
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,980
Why do you trust me so much?

687
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,220
I trust

688
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,300
your loyalty to the governor.

689
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,260
Well said.

690
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,340
I'm really lucky

691
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,900
to have you

692
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,100
by my side.

693
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,580
I'm really lucky.

694
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,660
Commandant Li,

695
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,780
I also want to thank you.

696
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,500
Master Qin, what do you call me?

697
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,740
Commandant Li Shisi of the Qingche Commandery.

698
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,900
There is a barren water on the upper side.

699
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Then there is a pond.

700
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,780
Then there is a pond at Xiehong Yan Di.

701
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,220
Commandant Li,

702
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,980
you have a good plan.

703
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,580
This time,

704
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,900
Shuozhou is in danger

705
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,740
of being in danger.

706
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,820
You are a high-ranking official.

707
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,380
Please take me here

708
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,500
to help the people of the city.

709
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,340
Governor.

710
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,780
Governor, Shisi is terrified.

711
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,580
He is still a burden to be burdened.

712
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,020
Tu Kashe was rescued.

713
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,500
Come on, stand up.

714
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,700
Stand up.

715
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,020
The Bear Division should be

716
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,300
in the middle of the action.

717
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,300
But I didn't expect that in the end...

718
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,420
Master is afraid that Eagle Division will come too.

719
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,100
Eagle Division?

720
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,020
Eagle Division is the strongest force of Ashile Tribe.

721
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,860
They are not as incompetent as

722
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,340
Tu Kashe's men.

723
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,020
If the enemy still has the advantage of attacking the city,

724
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,420
the river can't be strong.

725
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,140
The southeast is a mountain.

726
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,380
Moreover,

727
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,260
the east gate is full of mud.

728
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,060
Even people in Shuozhou have to be careful.

729
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,380
In this case,

730
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,220
the guards outside the east gate

731
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,700
should be transferred to the west of the city.

732
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,020
Good.

733
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,780
Listen up, everyone.

734
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,900
We will do as Commandant Li said.

735
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,340
Yes.

736
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,620
Yes.

737
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,420
Tegin,

738
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,060
that Tang god is sly.

739
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,980
set up a trap,

740
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,700
and even used the hand of the special forces to kill my brother.

741
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,020
I will avenge

742
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,420
Gongsun Hang's master and I.

743
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,420
What's wrong?

744
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,620
Do you feel bad that I killed Simaotu?

745
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,300
No.

746
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,420
It was my brother's fault.

747
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,540
As the chief of the army,

748
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,300
I couldn't even control the governor.

749
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
It was his fault.

750
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,940
I'm loyal to the special forces.

751
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,020
I can see it.

752
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,380
Although Simaotu is dead,

753
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,940
I can still provide information about Shuozhou

754
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,660
to the special forces.

755
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,180
Please give me another chance.

756
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,420
Remember,

757
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,020
I can take your life at any time.

758
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,700
Yes.

759
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,500
I will never let you escape again.

760
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
Report!

761
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,820
Sir,

762
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,260
Ashile Sun called the Eagle Division and left suddenly.

763
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,260
I don't know where he went.

764
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,900
Come on.

765
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,180
Everyone.

766
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,780
Today,

767
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,700
I will tell you a story.

768
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,140
I saw it with my own eyes.

769
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,860
Master Li came to turn the world upside down.

770
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,860
He shot the heavy sword

771
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,580
of the Black Iron.

772
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,420
He avoided our soldiers

773
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,300
and shot the Eagle Division

774
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,100
without hesitation.

775
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,180
He shot the Eagle Division

776
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,980
in Ashile's hand.

777
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,540
Good.

778
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,620
Good.

779
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,100
You can't call him Master Li.

780
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,260
The governor has already made a public oath.

781
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,180
He has been promoted to the position of the Qingcheng Commandant.

782
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,820
Yes.

783
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,580
Yes.

784
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,420
You are so young and promising.

785
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,620
How can you become the emperor's assistant?

786
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,260
It's the blessing of our Shuo State.

787
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,180
Yes.

788
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,900
I didn't expect that in just a few days,

789
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,340
you can share my burden

790
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,780
and defeat the enemy.

791
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,620
I'm so lucky.

792
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,100
I'll serve you with tea and wine.

793
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,900
Thank you.

794
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,100
You are too kind.

795
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,420
It's my pleasure to be able to

796
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,900
guard Shuo State with the governor.

797
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,300
You are so thin.

798
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,420
It's cold in the north.

799
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,580
You should wear more clothes.

800
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,780
I'll find some suitable fabrics

801
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,420
and sew more clothes for you.

802
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,540
You treat me so well.

803
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,380
I'm so touched.

804
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,020
It's a gift from you.

805
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,340
I think you shouldn't be polite to me.

806
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,540
If you don't mind,

807
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,460
this is your home from now on.

808
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,020
Thank you, governor.

809
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,220
Thank you, madam.

810
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,140
This is the first time

811
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,820
I feel so warm

812
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,020
since my mother passed away.

813
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,260
Madam, I'm sorry.

814
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,820
I want it, too.

815
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,260
Yes, you have it.

816
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,340
Make more for her.

817
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,420
Eat it. It's cold.

818
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,300
Yes.

819
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,660
Governor, the food is on fire.

820
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,980
It's turned into ashes.

821
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,980
What?

822
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,020
It's Eagle Division.

823
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,260
How's the fire?

824
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,540
It's spreading rapidly.

825
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
The guard has led us to put out the fire

826
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,460
to keep the people from getting hurt.

827
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,700
Xu Feng did a good job.

828
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,660
You may leave.

829
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,660
Yes.

830
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,660
Governor, is Eagle Division

831
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,340
the elite army you were worried about?

832
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,180
They are finally here.

833
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,260
I didn't expect them to come so soon.

834
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,460
Master, we found these

835
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,420
cannon wood boards at the quarry outside the east gate.

836
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,340
Eagle Division is fast in the battle.

837
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,020
I'm afraid they have already

838
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,980
crossed the quarry.

839
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,420
Governor, it's all my fault.

840
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,740
I lost my ground

841
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,500
and led the people from the east to the west.

842
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,700
I'm willing to make up for it.

843
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,180
Please send me to the east camp.

844
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
All right.

845
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,420
I'm glad to see you again.

846
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,820
I'm glad to see you again.

847
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,020
Before we part,

848
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,020
let's meet again.

849
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,620
I'll remember your name

850
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:49,020
in my dream.

851
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,820
Before dawn,

852
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,020
before dawn,

853
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,020
my longing flows.

854
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,420
There's always a moment

855
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,220
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

856
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,820
There's always a longing

857
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:17,420
that freezes everything between you and me.

858
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,620
In different worlds,

859
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,020
in different worlds,

860
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,820
I miss you.

861
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,620
My longing

862
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,620
has become a cocoon

863
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:37,620
in the dark night sky.

864
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,820
There's always a moment

865
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:51,620
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

866
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,020
There's always a longing

867
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:01,620
that freezes everything between you and me.

868
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,020
In different worlds,

869
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,420
in different worlds,

870
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,020
I miss you.

871
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,820
My longing

872
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,820
has become a cocoon

873
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:22,020
in the dark night sky.

874
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,020
I miss you.
