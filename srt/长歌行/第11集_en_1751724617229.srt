1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who is stubborn

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will use the light in the dark night

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To return to the long yearning in the rain

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Climbing the river of life and the river of hope

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Legend of Chusen

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Legend of Chusen

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Legend of Chusen

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Governor

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Governor

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Master Li

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Governor

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
As the new head of the governor's office

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am not familiar with the Shuo state affairs

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I should accompany you to go there

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No need

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Xu Feng can accompany me

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Master Li

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You can go to the forest

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I thought if Gongsun Heng took me to see Sima Tu

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I could adapt to it

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And learn about the border defense of Beijing

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now it seems that I can only make some efforts in the future

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then we should follow him now

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Forget it

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Since he refused

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If we go now

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It will be more useful

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Master

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Where are you going?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Xiume

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Xiume

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Tegin

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The scout is here

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ashile Sun

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He went to the direction of Shuo last night

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Eagle Division's army hasn't moved

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ashile Sun only took Mu Jin

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Guards

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tegin

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Gather

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If they dare to give us a chance

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We will let them know

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Who is the descendant of Wolf God

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tegin is wise

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Good

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Good job

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How is it?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If it's not what I saw

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't believe it

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are thousands of soldiers on both sides of the east and south

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not surprising

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Of course

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's hard to defend against the enemy when they are on both sides of the east and south

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The situation in Shuozhou is mainly in the northwest

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I just checked

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There are less than 20,000 soldiers

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How did the reputation of Shuozhou City come?

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Tu Kashe said these people are all useless

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is it true?

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When I entered the city

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Did you pay attention to the city wall?

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Much later than other cities in the Central Plains

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And the soil is sad

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It can be seen that the situation is getting stronger

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Usually people from all sides come and go

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But once it starts

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No one can enter the city wall

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
As long as there are enough food and clothing in the city

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's not hard to stay alive for years

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Interesting

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You have a plan

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We have to buy some fat head wood

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You don't care about learning, you will die

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you can help Gongsun Heng analyze the factory

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And make him the future

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He is a regular official of the Li Tang

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Won't he be moved?

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm afraid that's not what Gongsun Heng wants

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How old are you?

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You still want to eat noodles

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Master

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why does it seem that the noodles are not cooked?

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just want to eat

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm afraid you can't eat

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm afraid you can't eat

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm afraid you can't eat

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm afraid you can't eat

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm afraid you can't eat

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm afraid you can't eat

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why is there no money?

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Last time I gave the beggar money

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I used up all the money

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you go to the bank?

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Didn't you say that?

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We should drink water and make a living

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If the beggars didn't tell us where the bandits were

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How can we enter the Governor's mansion?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Since there are food and clothing in the Governor's mansion

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why do we need money?

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Master, this is your original words

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've received three

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's run together

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How do you like the food?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Two bowls of noodles, ten yuan in total

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No, no, no

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We haven't finished eating yet

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We'll pay later

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sorry, storekeeper

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We went out in a hurry

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We forgot to bring our bags

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How about this?

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll ask my brother to go home and get it

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll wait here

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay, I'll get the money now

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't run

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, run one first

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Run one more time

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Run one more time

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've seen a lot of tricks like this

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go to see the Governor

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, storekeeper

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Listen to me

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My brother will get the money

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He'll be back soon

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How do I know what you're talking about?

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Storekeeper, let go

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How much do you have?

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll give it to you

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why are you here?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ten yuan

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The extra money is for this young man

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thank you, thank you

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Sorry for the trouble just now

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's go

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's go

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ah Chun

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We meet again

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's the 14th

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Who is this?

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I told you not to come to Shuozhou

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But you didn't listen to me

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What about you?

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're here too

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How's your wound?

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know he's injured

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I bandaged him

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Of course I know

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So you're the vet

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's better if you don't bandage him

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You bandaged him

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's okay

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You don't have to mind it

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's okay

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
By the way

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Shuozhou is a fast city

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A businessman like you

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You'll be paid for everything

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How long are you going to stay in Shuozhou?

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Forget it

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We'd better not ask about each other

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Master

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You escaped

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're a salesman

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Who is this?

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A'Dou

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ah Chun helped us to get the money

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We're leaving the city

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Would you like to send us a picture?

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Of course

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I won't leave you

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I won't send you if you leave me

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Ah Chun, I wish you a successful business

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Shisi

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like last time

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you don't have a reason to stay in Shuozhou

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You'd better leave earlier

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Where can I go if I leave?

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Have you ever thought about going to the prairie?

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Prairie?

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know the place

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'd better not

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You know me

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I'd better leave

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Who are they?

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They're the money of Ashile Army

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They're going to attack the city

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Shisi

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I have some men to stay in the north

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going back to take care of them

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You'd better leave Shuozhou as soon as possible

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Goodbye

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Take care

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Master, what should we do now?

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Back to the city

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Tu Kashe wants to take advantage of your absence

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and take the lead

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do we really have to do nothing?

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you want to see Tu Kashe's mess

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just stay

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm not interested in the Sang family

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You think he's a fool?

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This stupid Tu Kashe

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Not to mention he's still here

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He?

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Stop

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Who dares to break into the city?

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hurry up

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ashile Army is coming

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hurry up

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hurry up

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The Ashile Army is coming

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Move away

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you miss the chance

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Can you afford it?

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hurry up

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Li Zhugu

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let him come up

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes

231
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Li Zhugu

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why are you here?

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Master

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The Ashile Army is coming

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hurry up

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No hurry

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No hurry

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You mean

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No hurry to attack the city now

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No hurry now

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let them get closer

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's okay

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Master

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Have you thought it through?

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Once Ashile Army comes into the city

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Shuozhou will be in a disaster

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And the whole Tang will be in danger

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Stop

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
How dare you attack the master?

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
All right, Xu Feng

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's just a little bit of a plot

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Now the enemy is attacking

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't have time to explain it to you

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Guards

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Take them back to the mansion

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Get out of here

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Gongsun Hang

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Go

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You won't use your soldiers

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let me go

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Gongsun Hang

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Go

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm not going to the city

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't go shopping in the mansion

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The governor ordered you not to fight

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If you believe him so much

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What if his decision is wrong?

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The governor has his own arrangement

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I think Gongsun Hang

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
is just a commoner

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know what he's doing

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He's got the whole city's residents

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He's so dedicated to support him

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Did you hear that battle drum?

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's only been a while

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This battle

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
is probably the only one

279
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A'Dou

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you think

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
we came to Shuozhou city wrong?

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
A person who doesn't even know the basic military tactics

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I even asked him to help me

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Even I know the cultural and cultural affairs are urgent

286
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He's the governor of Shuozhou

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He doesn't understand

288
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm afraid he did it on purpose

289
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If

290
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
he dares to give Shuozhou city to Ashile

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I won't let him go

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I won't let him go either

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Governor

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Master Li

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I…

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why don't you ask me?

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ashile's cavalry attacked the city

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We can't deal with it

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The situation will be dire

300
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Tell me

301
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How many casualties?

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ten thousand?

303
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Twenty thousand?

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Or more?

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Master Li, we…

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Since you don't know the tactics

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Why don't you listen to me?

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why do you have to do it on purpose?

309
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Did you do it on purpose?

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You…

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why do you

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
kill the people of the city?

313
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Master Li

314
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This battle is a disaster

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We won

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We won?

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How did we win?

318
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, Governor

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Tell us

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
How did we win?

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How did we win?

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Please calm down

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Listen to my information

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The reason why you

325
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
refused to attack the city

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
is of another meaning

327
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
At that time, there were three thousand

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
workers hidden inside and outside the city

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ashile's cavalry was running away

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They entered our

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
archery range very quickly

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You ordered

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to fire ten thousand arrows

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ashile's cavalry

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
couldn't catch up

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They changed their formation immediately

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
At this time

338
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you ordered again

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Pass the order

340
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Open the city gate

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and draw the horses

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Our soldiers are hunting

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to attack the enemy

344
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's the Yanyue Formation

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You know the army tactics

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I learned it before

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Come on

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Sit down

349
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Then you can tell us

350
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you were to lead the army to the formation

351
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
what should you do next?

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Next

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yanyue should change to the snake

354
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The snake is horizontal

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and the tail is straight

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The foot

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And then?

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Guard Xu, go on

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Then

360
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
After the series of heavy battles

361
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ashile's cavalry

362
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
was actually already defeated

363
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But the leader Tukashe

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
didn't give up

365
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and tried to attack us again

366
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Knock on the battle drum

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and light the smoke

368
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At this time

369
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
our ambushes

370
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
were on the opposite side of the city

371
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the northeast and northwest

372
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They were fighting

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and lit the smoke

374
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The soldiers shouted

375
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and didn't notice

376
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Tukashe was surrounded by four sides

377
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and ran away immediately

378
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He fell off the horse head

379
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and ran away in a hurry

380
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The governor is really powerful

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the northwest and northeast

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
each has ambushes

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why didn't the governor

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
shout and attack the cavalry?

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why did it

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
make such a big noise?

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Could the governor be...

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Be what?

390
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
A false reputation

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The minister Li

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
is indeed a young talent

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You have seen through my plan

394
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You are right

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The ambush

396
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
was only for two thousand people

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The governor is really good at using troops

398
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why?

399
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You don't say that I'm not good at using troops

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and act on my own?

401
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry, your highness

402
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I've learned the art of war

403
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and told lies to you

404
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry, your highness

405
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm not qualified

406
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry, your highness

407
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm sorry, your highness

408
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I won't

409
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
take this kind of little thing

410
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But you risked your life

411
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and took the risk

412
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can feel

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
your love

414
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want to

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
thank you

416
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
for your help

417
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Governor

418
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Governor is good at using people

419
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm flattered

420
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
After this battle

421
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I finally understand

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
why you never give up

423
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and how the iron wall of Shuozhou

424
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and the people's peace and happiness

425
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
came about

426
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you don't mind

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I want to

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I want to

429
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You want to fight with us

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
to defend Shuozhou

431
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm willing to

432
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm willing to share the burden

433
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're a young and talented man

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know the art of war

435
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm really happy

436
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Get up

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm willing to learn the art of war from you

438
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay, you should defend Shuozhou too

439
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Get up

440
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Congratulations, master Xiong, you're back safely

441
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This time

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you all came to see me

443
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Of course

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
In order to get the head of the army

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
in the early morning

446
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I took the cavalry to attack the city without any reason

447
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Although it was not good

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but at least the army didn't die

449
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm in a bad mood

450
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'd better

451
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
put an end to your bad mouth

452
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Xiong Shi's first battle

453
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
has been a shock

454
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If the future battle is in a passive state

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the future battle will be a shock

456
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm afraid

457
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm afraid

458
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm afraid

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm afraid

460
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If the future battle is in a passive state

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
it will be your fault today

462
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What's wrong?

463
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll take Xiong Shi out for training

464
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why are you talking so much?

465
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I know what I'm doing

466
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't need you to care about it

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We don't want to care about your business

468
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Today's battle

469
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
we will report to Khan

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
in full force

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't need you to report

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll report it myself

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Send this letter

474
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
to the commander-in-chief of the march

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Ashile Tribe

476
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is in a bad mood

477
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If I guess it right

478
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
they will definitely

479
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
attack again

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We need reinforcements

481
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll go now

482
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Commander

483
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Master Li

484
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Commander

485
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is the map of the new meeting

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Please check it

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes

488
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why are you so worried?

489
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
After all, we won the battle

490
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Why don't you feel happy to win?

491
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's just a small victory

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's there to be happy about?

493
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I've sent Xu Feng

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
to ask for reinforcements from the commander-in-chief of the march

495
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Reinforcements?

496
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This Shuozhou Gu-er Jin soup

497
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
needs reinforcements?

498
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The real enemy of Ashile Tribe

499
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
hasn't appeared yet

500
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Look

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This Wuding River

502
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is deep and wide

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It should be the natural direction

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
between Shuozhou City and Ashile Tribe

505
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But now

506
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Shuozhou's military supply is not enough

507
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We can't send troops to guard the river

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is the enemy's

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
natural direction

510
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
to the city

511
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Since they will pass

512
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
through this river

513
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
why don't we change this river

514
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
into a battle route?

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Change it into a battle route?

516
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
For the Ashile Tribe's army

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
who are not good at water

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
they should prefer to

519
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
cry in the water

520
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Of course

521
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If the river cries

522
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
there will be no problem

523
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They will be able to

524
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
pass through the river

525
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They will be able to

526
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
pass through the river

527
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In that case

528
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
we should give them

529
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
a chance to cry

530
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Give them a chance to cry?

531
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What do you mean?

532
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I heard

533
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that the water in the past seven months

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
was full of rain

535
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and the water in the gold

536
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The chance to cry

537
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
will be more than half a month

538
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But coincidentally

539
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
there is a secret forest

540
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
on the river

541
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If we send the army

542
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
to block the river

543
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
with stones and stones

544
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
we can finish the task in a few days

545
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Your Highness

546
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
what do you think?

547
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You

548
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You are so good

549
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You have such a good plan

550
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You are too kind

551
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I am sorry

552
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Your Highness

553
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You are so smart

554
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I admire you

555
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Ashile Tribe's Bear Division has just been defeated

557
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
They are in a panic

558
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I guess they will not

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
send troops to fight for a while

560
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Even if they dare to send troops

561
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
it will be a big danger

562
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It seems that

563
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
we need to think about

564
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
how to let them relax

565
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and be careful

566
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If the army of Ashile Tribe

567
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
is not so strong

568
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
there is actually a more reliable way

569
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
A more reliable way?

570
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Tell me about it

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The ancient teacher Sun Zi said

572
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The one who fights is the winner

573
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
if he is the one who wins

574
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
he will win

575
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
If he is the one who leads the army

576
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
to attract the enemy's main force

577
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and send more cavalry

578
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to go around the road

579
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and attack them from behind the enemy

580
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
to break through the enemy

581
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and then defeat them one by one

582
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
it will be more satisfying

583
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Good

584
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You are so young

585
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
but you have such a strong spirit

586
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I really admire you

587
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It reminds me of another person

588
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Who?

589
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The one who was the leader

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
was the King of Qin

591
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and now the Crown Prince

592
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
In the end, the army of Ashile Tribe is defeated

593
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
At that time, the young army

594
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
led thousands of troops to attack the enemy

595
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This is the result

596
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a great achievement

597
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I didn't expect that the army of Ashile Tribe

598
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
could hear the same tactics

599
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
from the army of Li Zubu

600
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Li Zubu

601
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It seems that

602
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
what you said in front of me

603
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
is a little bit

604
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's just a word of apology

605
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The Crown Prince is famous

606
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I just said the same thing

607
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's not worth it

608
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Li Zubu

609
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You don't have to apologize

610
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's a good thing that Shuozhou has you

611
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
One more thing

612
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Li Zubu

613
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This is the report from the court

614
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You have to arrange a day and night

615
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
to send it to Chang'an

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I just don't believe

617
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
the new general

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's not about what you believe

619
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and what you don't believe

620
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's just about the safety of the people

621
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We have to take one more step

622
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
closer to the situation

623
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes, I'll do it right away

624
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Li Shimin

625
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I can't get rid of your shadow

626
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I remember now

627
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You are from Shuozhou

628
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know nothing about Shuozhou

629
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You knew that you would fail today

630
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Are you trying to collude with the enemy?

631
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm innocent

632
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm willing to be punished

633
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I have a plan to give to you

634
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Listen to me

635
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
If you kill me

636
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm willing to do it

637
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Say

638
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
How much do you have this time?

639
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
If this plan is successful

640
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Shuozhou will not be defeated

641
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The Qin army will be the first to attack

642
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What?

643
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Master

644
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Si Ma Zongguan asked you to come to his mansion

645
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Si Ma Tu

646
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sorry

647
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Did he say anything else?

648
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No

649
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Could it be that he agreed to the reinforcement?

650
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Want to discuss with you

651
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Since Ashile Tribe's invasion

652
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There is no movement there

653
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He has been guarding against me

654
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's not that simple

655
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay, you can leave first

656
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes

657
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Qin Lang

658
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Si Ma Tu invited me

659
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It must be a red door banquet

660
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But he is the commander-in-chief

661
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I can't let him down

662
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to go

663
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Master

664
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll go with you

665
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
No need

666
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think it's more useful for you to stay in the mansion

667
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Qin Lang

668
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
If I can't come back this time

669
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You can add these four words

670
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Give it to the Ministry of Rites

671
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Master, is that true?

672
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
These two young men have a lot of background

673
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I have always been a person who does not doubt

674
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't doubt people

675
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
As for this thing

676
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What time to give it to them

677
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You decide

678
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Master

679
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Qin Lang

680
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I have to go

681
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm leaving

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Qin Lang

683
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I know your worry

684
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I believe him

685
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But I believe you more

686
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Master

687
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
This

688
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Listen to his words and watch his actions

689
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You can know his heart

690
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I know

691
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He may be a little hidden

692
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But I believe more

693
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
He is a person who is harmless to the people of the Tang Dynasty

694
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
These years

695
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I led the army to defeat the enemy

696
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I have fought many battles with the enemy

697
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Maybe the enemy has already figured out my route

698
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But he is not enough

699
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I see the army and the craftsmanship of the people

700
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
There are changes

701
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a strange route for the enemy

702
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Maybe it can be a little bit more

703
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Just that his current experience in combat is still ahead

704
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It still needs you to help

705
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Even if I can't come back this time

706
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I can't come back

707
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I believe

708
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
As long as you two work together

709
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I can think of a way to save the people of Shuozhou

710
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And the pillar of danger

711
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Here

712
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I thank you first

713
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Master, you don't have to do this

714
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I obey

715
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Master

716
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Commander

717
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Stop

718
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What

719
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Xu Feng

720
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You just wait for me here

721
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes

722
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Go

723
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I am Gongsun Heng

724
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Greetings to the commander-in-chief

725
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I am afraid

726
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I hope the commander-in-chief can think about it

727
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I want to ask you

728
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Did you go to war today?

729
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes

730
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Today the military situation is urgent

731
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
When I found the enemy

732
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Ashile Tribe has already arrived

733
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I am really in a state of emergency

734
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I can't send a man to report to the commander-in-chief

735
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I have to go now

736
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I will wait for you

737
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I will wait for you

738
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I will wait for you

739
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I will wait for you

740
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I am here to report to the commander-in-chief

741
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I have to go now

742
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Please forgive me

743
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I will wait for the emperor to look for the troops around the four states

744
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You go to the army

745
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Listen to my order

746
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
No one can change the troops privately

747
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't understand the reason for going now

748
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But today's battle lasts two hours

749
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
In these two hours

750
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Gongsun Heng is too busy to find someone

751
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't think he can find someone to inform me

752
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I was careless

753
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
People see you as Gongsun Heng

754
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
How can you be careless?

755
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
After all

756
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Gongsun's governor never paid attention to me

757
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think he has been with the official for a long time

758
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He forgot the world and celebrated the ceremony

759
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I am filial

760
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I am sincere

761
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I hope the governor can see it clearly

762
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I have no doubt

763
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You say that

764
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I framed you

765
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I dare not

766
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You are the only one who can get the troops

767
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You have been a mountain doctor in Shuozhou for decades

768
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You are so arrogant

769
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What are you afraid of?

770
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Today you tear off the troops in Shuozhou

771
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't care about the troops

772
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
If I don't do anything

773
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The other three states will also fight against each other

774
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I am so ignorant

775
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Come

776
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Governor, the war is urgent now

777
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Please allow me to withdraw from the enemy

778
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I will come to your house again

779
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I will ask the governor for forgiveness

780
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Come to apologize after you are done

781
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You have a lot of face

782
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why do you say that?

783
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Governor, I value the war

784
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I value the people

785
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Take them away

786
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Take them away

787
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Governor Gongsun said

788
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
The governor of Liu Su will send you back tonight

789
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Governor

790
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Have you received the war report from the governor?

791
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yes

792
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The news from Shuozhou will not reach Chang'an

793
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Send someone to guard the south

794
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The news from the north will not be spread

795
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Before Ashile Tribe withdraws

796
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Any news from the north will not be spread

797
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes

798
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Come out

799
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's done

800
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You should go

801
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I don't welcome you here

802
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I have a message for you

803
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Gongsun Heng who released the army

804
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
He made the army angry

805
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If he attracts the main force

806
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
He will send the four states of Beijing to the hot oil pot

807
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I am afraid that the position of governor

808
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Can't be kept

809
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I helped you so much

810
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You are in a hurry to drive me away

811
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's not appropriate

812
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You have nothing to do with my family

813
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You are the leader of the enemy

814
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Don't get me involved

815
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You killed me

816
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I did it for your good

817
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I don't want to see you die

818
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I want to sacrifice my life

819
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
To fulfill the reputation of the people

820
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Don't say you killed him

821
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You can kill him

822
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
How can I kill Gongsun Heng?

823
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's none of your business

824
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Ok

825
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's a long story

826
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You will be the head of the military

827
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I am so grateful to Ashile Tribe

828
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I have seen the situation

829
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We are brothers

830
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I won't forget your benefits

831
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You have a grudge with Gongsun Heng

832
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
If you don't want to see him

833
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
He has a grudge with Gongsun Heng

834
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
If he turns around

835
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Do you have a place to live in Shuozhou?

836
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I can only advise you

837
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Give up the case and seek fame

838
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's not too late

839
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's getting dawn

840
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Get out

841
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Master

842
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's late. Go to bed

843
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I will sleep after I finish the documents

844
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Mr. Qin

845
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You are old

846
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You should tell others to do the night search

847
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You are so considerate

848
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Mr. Qin

849
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I have only one word

850
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I have no regrets

851
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Ok

852
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Ok

853
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Mr. Qin

854
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Xu Feng

855
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You are back so late

856
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Where is master?

857
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Sima Tu's subordinate told me

858
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Master will stay in the government house tonight

859
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think something is wrong

860
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He should come back

861
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
He is caught by them

862
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Why?

863
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I am afraid he will send troops to fight the enemy in the daytime

864
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
The enemy?

865
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Sima Tu

866
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
He has always regarded you as his eyes

867
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
He never answered the order

868
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He asked for reinforcements

869
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
He had to send troops to fight the enemy

870
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I am afraid they caught him

871
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Mr. Qin is right

872
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Since he joined the court

873
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You are the only commander in the army in Shuozhou

874
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The government has appointed a new general to rule the four provinces

875
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
To restrict your power

876
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
In order not to let him lead the army

877
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So today

878
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Although we get the bandits

879
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
We will be the scapegoat for them

880
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes

881
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The official is so ignorant

882
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I will send someone to the government house to save master

883
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Stop

884
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You can't go

885
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Why?

886
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They are so stupid

887
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
They dare not to tell the truth

888
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Because they haven't caught master's evidence yet

889
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If we attack the commander in chief

890
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They will accuse master of treason

891
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Is there any way to save master?

892
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Master is the governor of Yizhou

893
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Although he is a traitor

894
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
He won't be killed for now

895
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But it's only for the three of us

896
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
We can't let the wife know

897
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Otherwise she will be worried

898
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes

899
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Xu Feng

900
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You are the son of the Chihou

901
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You are good at investigating

902
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You keep an eye on the commander in chief

903
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You never leave

904
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You always tell me everything

905
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Tomorrow I will go to see Sima Tu

906
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
To find out the truth

907
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes

908
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Master Qin, I will go with you tomorrow

909
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Li Zhubo

910
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You can stay in the mansion

911
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's a great help for my master

912
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Sima Tu

913
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Where is the military counselor of Tu Kashe?

914
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
His surname is Sima

915
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
He is a Central Plain official who was with Great Khan during the war

916
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He was a little bit stupid

917
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So he left a man

918
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
As a military counselor of Xiong

919
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
In Central Plain dialect

920
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
He is a little man

921
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't know what he has done to Tu Kashe

922
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
The Chihou reported

923
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Gongsun Heng was taken away by the commander in chief

924
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Gongsun Heng was taken away?

925
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So what?

926
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Gongsun Heng has been in Shuozhou for so many years

927
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
He was locked up by his own people

928
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
He is giving us the city

929
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What a pity

930
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Once the famous general is destroyed

931
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Listen to Sima

932
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Don't let him burn us

933
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yes

934
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes

935
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I congratulate you

936
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
My brother has taken Gongsun Heng down

937
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But I will make a good plan

938
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I will surrender one day

939
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Great

940
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
If it's true

941
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's not just my Tu Kashe's crazy Tengda

942
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's also your day

943
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I want to see that bastard

944
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
How can I prove it?

945
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You are...

946
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Just tell me what you are doing

947
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The government is in chaos

948
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Master

949
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Sima Tu blocked me out this morning

950
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But my Chihou reported

951
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Sima Tu called the governor to collude with Ashile Tribe

952
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
He ignored the military order and had a chance to rebel

953
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So he was arrested and interrogated

954
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Isn't this nonsense?

955
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Where is the justice?

956
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Justice?

957
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
If there is, then the world will be peaceful

958
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm sorry

959
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm sorry

960
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm sorry

961
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm sorry
