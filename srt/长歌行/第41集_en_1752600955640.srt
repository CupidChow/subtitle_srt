1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am the one who has passed through the stubbornness

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am the one who has passed through the stubbornness

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am the one who has passed through the stubbornness

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am the one who has passed through the stubbornness

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the one who has passed through the stubbornness

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Princess

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
An Rong

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you think I will be sent to Ashile Tribe?

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Princess, you are the pearl on His Majesty's palm

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I believe His Majesty will not let you go away

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Princess

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Everything is not over yet

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't worry too much

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You saw Ashile Ketun today

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I heard the old man in the palace talk about his story

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He has been married to the grassland for so long

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He changed his husband one generation after another

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Today it looks like a glorious day, but what about the back?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Who knows what he has been through?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hao Du, tell me

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Am I too selfish?

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I only think of myself

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Princess

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you are willing

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Leyan

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Brother Shuyu

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are here

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't say it

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I heard about the matter in the temple

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Brother Shuyu

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What should I do?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know what to do

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Brother Shuyu

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Brother Shuyu

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't be afraid

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I will go back to the emperor

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My sister Qianyan said

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I will let the emperor take back the order

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If not

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If not, I will go to call A Yan

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let him talk with me

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The emperor must be in the face of A Yan

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No use

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Now is the critical period of the Mohe Alliance

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ashile tribe people have done this

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If A Yan regrets

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They will make an article

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If the alliance is affected by me

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How can I face the world?

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Princess of the Tang Dynasty

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If dead

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No one will let a dead person go to the alliance

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Leyan

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't do anything stupid

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother Shuyu

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not doing anything stupid

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
King of Zhou Nan is in the Wei family

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The oil market is in a mess

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The goods are fake

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Changge

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Changge is the most experienced in pretending to die

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He must be able to think of a way for me

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As long as Princess Yongan is not there

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No one can force me to go to the alliance

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It won't implicate A Yan

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is Xia Xia's fault

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What should I do?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you want to die?

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There will be a way

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If Ashile people put this matter

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Officially sent to A Yan

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
After everything is settled

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I really want to marry to the grassland

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There must be a way

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There must be a way

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There must be a way

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother Shuyu

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it my family going to the grassland?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Actually for you

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It doesn't matter so much

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Of course not

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because we grew up together

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I always treat you like a real sister

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Treat you like a real sister

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sister Qin

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sister Qin

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So that day

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I express my feelings to you

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You still treat me as sister Qin

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Leyan

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You go out first

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to go in alone

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Wei Shuyu

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you going to do now?

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can't answer

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So this matter

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
From start to finish

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You never thought about how to deal with it

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The grassland and the Tang Dynasty are one

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Of course, a powerful hostage is needed

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Princess Yuan'an is the pearl in the emperor's palm

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This matter falls on her head

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Anyone can think of you

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You never thought about it

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I ask you now

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can't even answer

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hao Du

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hao Du

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You are overreacting

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you only treat yourself

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As a courtier

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I won't ask

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But you don't know

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She likes you

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She always cares about your feelings

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your thoughts

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you want to make her sad?

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
None of your business

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't fight anymore

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You go back

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I want to be alone

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Mimi

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Mimi

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are they here?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't worry

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I won't let them find you

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's okay, Changge

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm not afraid

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I think it over

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Since I'm alive

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They will find me sooner or later

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's no use escaping

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Since people are alive

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They should live happily

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If he didn't come

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have to hide

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Like a ghost

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sniffing

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Eagle Division sent a letter

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Mu Jin has entered the tent successfully

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now he should have entered the Dingxiang Palace

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Really

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then they already know

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Mu Jin lied to them

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If they find Mu Jin

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Entering the Dingxiang Palace

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Will they

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mu Jin saved a soldier in the tent

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They have an old friendship

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He should go to him this time

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
God bless me

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I hope Mu Jin can save him

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But it seems very bad now

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yicheng must have come prepared

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's not good for Leyan

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm here

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you disappointed

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Leyan is not a micro fish

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I order you not to find him

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Princess

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If you really like him

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll tie him up for you

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can leave

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will bear all the consequences

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How do you bear it

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
With your position

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If I leave

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Leyan will be furious

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How do you bear it

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm a man

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I care about the world

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I care about the world

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I care about the world

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I care about

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I care about my friends

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I hope you don't mind

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you think of me as a friend

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll ride your horse for you

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can leave

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I won't leave

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm Princess Yongan

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
From the moment I buried Xiao Wu

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I decided

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
To be a princess of Tang

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So I can't leave

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have to face all this

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then the princess is going to the peace treaty

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I won't go

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I don't want to rely on anyone

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have to fight for it myself

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hao Du

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Will you stand behind me

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll go

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Khatun

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Didn't you say you wanted to hide from me

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why did you come to the door

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why did you come to Chang'an

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You are questioning me

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So what

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The internal affairs of Ashile Tribe

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
When did you manage it

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
As Khatun of Ashile Tribe

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Am I just a decoration

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In your eyes

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Except your father

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who else can you see

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm asking you

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No matter what

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm your elder

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It doesn't matter if you don't see me

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You have to save your father's face

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
My father sent you here

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Otherwise

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
How is he

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You just have to be willing to bring the Eagle Division back

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
To serve the grassland

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Your father will make you return to the tent

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The past is better than the past

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The past is old

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
As always

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm afraid this is just your idea

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Is there a difference

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This time I went to Chang'an

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's enough to prove

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can represent your father in full

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Pity

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You are here

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Nothing is missing

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What about Li Changge

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The famous Eagle Division of Ashile Tribe

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The Eagle Division of Ashile Tribe

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm so worried about being Li Changge's bodyguard

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sun

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sometimes

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I really can't see you

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What's so good about Li Changge

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How did it become

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The soft tears of the grassland god

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Want to be on the battlefield

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The war is in the face of the people

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The enemy's long knife

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The cold sword of the same sword is not scary

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What's scary

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is that you have a weakness

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Your weakness

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Is on the stage

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If you touch him

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will make you die

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I saw the princess

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What's up

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Mimi Guli is still alive

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
In the team of the Mobei emissary

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Princess

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't you think it's an accident

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Since I saw

269
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Ashile's first act

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I knew Mimi Guli

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Must be alive

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Do we want

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All the news

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm afraid it's too late

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm afraid it's too late

276
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm afraid it's too late

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Send a message to the soldier

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Tell the thunder

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The one who should die

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
None of them died

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes, princess

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How is the investigation

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You asked me to investigate

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I have checked

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Those medicine are poisonous

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Poisonous

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But it will slowly

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Go into the person's organs

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Six

290
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
People will die of a fall if time goes by

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This woman is really cruel

292
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You saved my life before

293
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This time I will be the king's grace

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will keep it secret

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
About your incense

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I hope

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I know

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This matter

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Won't bother you anymore

301
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Uncle Lei's patrol is very strict every day

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't let him find you

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wait

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There is one more thing

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Have you heard

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A man named Buzhen

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is a child

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Child

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There are no children in the prison

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In Dingxiang Palace

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There may only be children in Suiwang Palace

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Suiwang Qi Palace

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know about the rest

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Take care

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What did Anna ask you to do

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I ask you

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What did Anna ask you to do

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Step aside

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Does she want you

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Bring the Eagle Division back

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Come back

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Your Anna in Mobei

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The cold sword almost killed me

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am not a child

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I am a child

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I am a child

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Tell me

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How is Fuhan

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Anna took good care of him

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You don't have to worry

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What are you looking at me for

332
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you really going to live like a fool

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Say it again

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You never thought

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Fuhan is strong

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why did you suddenly fall ill

337
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And move the toothed barrier to Dingxiang

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Fuhan

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't know

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't know

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't know

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Fuhan is sick

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The whole disease is set in Dingxiang

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
All this

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you really think it's natural

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't try to slander our house

347
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't bring yourself

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just you

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Can't do such a bad thing

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I have confirmed

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yicheng is now the real master of Ashile Tribe

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So it is

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It turns out that he has been scheming against me before

354
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He has already targeted you

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Your identity

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He will know sooner or later

357
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The army is coming

358
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Nothing to be afraid of

359
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If I didn't take you to the prairie

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If you didn't take me to the prairie

361
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I would have been in a bad mood

362
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How dare you protect me like this now

364
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You are a high-ranking special envoy

365
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Can you still look at me

366
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Such a Li Tang traitor

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You are here

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
what

369
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you not willing to be found by me

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You think you can escape

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
By reporting a false news

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You should understand

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Death is not the end

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A person who lives in hell

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If you want to die

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That other living child

377
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You have to live in hell

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
How do you let me bear with it

379
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What's wrong with you

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Why are you

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He is your child

383
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He is a child

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why are you so cruel

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Because you betrayed me

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You are good

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I won't treat him badly

389
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But you betrayed me

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I just took one of his fingers

391
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't you think

392
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I am already very kind

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Mimi

394
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Mimi

395
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Mimi

396
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Mimi

397
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What happened

398
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Sun, Mimi is missing

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
She was scared

400
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm afraid she

401
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't worry

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We will find it separately

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It can be found

404
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
it is good

405
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I will go to the hospital

406
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can find it

407
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it is good

408
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Mimi

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
A Ye

410
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
A Ye

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
A Ye is going to discuss with the emperor

412
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Is it about the marriage of the princess

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I beg A Ye to persuade the emperor

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let the princess

415
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Shuyu

416
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I ask you

417
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You and the princess grew up together

418
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Did you do something

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
A Ye

420
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Whether Princess Yongan is far away from marriage

422
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Is the key to the court

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You have no right

424
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Talk to the emperor

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Understand

426
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If you really love the princess

427
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You have to fight for it yourself

428
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Now there is only one suspicious identity

429
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Prince Consort

430
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You have grown up now

431
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Know what you want

432
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Think clearly

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Just fight for it yourself

434
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Puyi

435
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's my fault

436
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I didn't protect you

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You must live well

438
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
When I reunite with you

439
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry

440
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you want to see your brother

441
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just listen to me

442
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Princess

443
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let you do something for her

444
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If you don't do it

445
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The consequences are not as simple as a finger

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I will not do it

447
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I will not do it

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I will not do it

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Mimi

450
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Mimi

451
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's really you

452
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Ashile Sun was killed

453
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I knew you were still alive

454
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I go back first

455
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't you want to see me so much

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Xiaohe is noble

457
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Why do you have to be a slave to me

458
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I never treated you as a slave

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Mimi

460
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Can you go back with me

461
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I promise to treat you well

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Mimi

463
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Listen to me

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Marry the princess of Tang is just

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I promise

466
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I will never have any sincerity for her

467
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Who are you sincere for

468
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why are you telling me a slave

469
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Of course I have to tell you

470
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I have to tell you I

471
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I like you

472
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
When I was a kid

473
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You rode a horse beside me

474
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I just thought your hair was so beautiful

475
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The floating look is like the silk of the Central Plains

476
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in this world

477
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Also the best

478
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
When I play with you

479
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Are you happy

480
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Happy

481
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
As long as you play with me, I am very happy

482
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's because I dare not make you unhappy

483
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Because if you are not happy

484
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I am very worried

485
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I and Bu Zhen don't know what kind of punishment to be punished

486
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
In fact, every time I see them

487
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I will be afraid

488
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I even hate

489
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Why are you saving me

490
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'd rather die than live

491
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I am a living person

492
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I am not a toy without feelings

493
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I don't want to stand up every day

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Go to please anyone

495
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I just don't want to be a little bit sick every day

496
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Will be beaten, beaten, scolded

497
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you understand these feelings

498
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You don't understand at all

499
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So little Khan

500
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I can't go back with you

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Mimi

502
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Mimi, where are you?

503
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm looking for you everywhere

504
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm fine

505
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'll walk around

506
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Don't be afraid

507
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You still have us

508
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Changge, Xiaoguang

509
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm fine

510
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm fine

511
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm fine

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm fine

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm fine

514
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm fine

515
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I will always be careful

516
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If the princess really goes to the prairie

517
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I will suffer in the future

518
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You can rest assured

519
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I will definitely ask Leyan to marry Ashile Tribe

520
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Great

521
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Changge

522
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Shuyu

523
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,280
Shouldn't you be in Taiji Palace

524
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
to discuss the marriage proposal?

525
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,480
Why are you here?

526
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,720
Shuyu.

527
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,360
I want to stop the marriage proposal.

528
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,840
But I'm not qualified.

529
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,080
You want to stop the marriage proposal

530
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,280
for Leyan's happiness.

531
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,320
Why do you still want to talk about the qualification?

532
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,280
What are you thinking about?

533
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,560
Aunt said

534
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,480
if I try to persuade her as the husband's son,

535
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
it might hurt.

536
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,120
That's right.

537
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
With your affection for Leyan for many years,

538
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,280
he will think about it.

539
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,960
And Leyan will be happy.

540
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,320
You know,

541
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,160
he's always...

542
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,840
I know.

543
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,240
He confessed to me.

544
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,320
Then why are you hesitating?

545
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,360
This is the most effective way

546
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,840
to stop the marriage proposal.

547
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,480
But how can you break your promise now?

548
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,800
Shuyu,

549
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,360
this is not a right past.

550
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,040
You need to prove it to me.

551
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,320
Ifroposy is the official position in Taiji Palace.

552
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,400
Auntie Shuyu

553
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
can't lamatise people's love.

554
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
And the most valuable thing you have is

555
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,680
joins the love of her homeland,

556
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,020
and all of our country's people,

557
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,480
as well asul completely hold her tight.

558
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,240
Yes.

559
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
to make you suffer.

560
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
To me,

561
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
she's really my sister.

562
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,600
I see.

563
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,120
In that case,

564
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,440
Leyan doesn't need

565
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,520
a forced love.

566
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,920
We can only wait and see

567
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
what Ashile Tribe will do.

568
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,120
Then we'll know what to do.

569
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,720
Changge,

570
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,080
since the Eastern Palace was born,

571
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
I feel that you and I

572
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,160
are getting further away from Leyan.

573
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,600
You can't catch up with us.

574
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
Actually, when you said these words,

575
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,960
you're already different from before.

576
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
Sometimes, the most difficult thing

577
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,320
is to face yourself.

578
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
You've done it.

579
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,960
Actually, you don't have to worry too much.

580
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,680
Because the person who wants to stop this

581
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,880
is not only you and me.

582
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,920
You mean...

583
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,200
His Majesty...

584
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
He may be the king of a country,

585
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
but he's also a father.

586
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
He definitely doesn't want to

587
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,080
end Leyan's happiness.

588
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,400
But

589
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
now, we may need a chance.

590
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,120
What chance?

591
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,440
Let's wait and see.

592
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,080
It's hard to make a decision now.

593
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,240
Your Majesty,

594
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
the marriage of Princess Yongan

595
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
can't be changed.

596
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,800
It's already been decided.

597
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,200
If Tang breaks the contract,

598
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,080
Ashile Tribe will

599
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,600
change the marriage.

600
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,600
They won't keep their promise.

601
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,680
How will they do it?

602
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,600
They'll trust all the tribes.

603
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
What Zhang Shilang means is

604
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
that Princess Yongan

605
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
is not a common daughter

606
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
of the imperial family

607
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,080
because of His Majesty's bloodline.

608
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,440
Ashile Tribe

609
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,520
will not use this marriage

610
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,360
as a cover story.

611
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,000
Your Majesty,

612
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,280
marriage is indeed a good thing.

613
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,880
But it's also a matter of the future.

614
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,040
Now,

615
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,240
only the marriage contract

616
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,440
is the fastest way to trust

617
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,760
all tribes of the desert.

618
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,760
Your Majesty,

619
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,760
I'm deeply grateful to you.

620
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,320
If we keep our promise

621
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
to Ashile Tribe,

622
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
and don't keep our promise,

623
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm afraid

624
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,120
they'll be caught up in this matter.

625
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,360
And we

626
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
can't

627
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,000
talk about the alliance with all tribes of the desert.

628
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,960
Your Majesty,

629
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
I think the marriage contract is a must.

630
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,320
If the marriage contract is a must,

631
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
it can't be Ashile Tribe.

632
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,800
That's right.

633
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,120
If we keep our promise,

634
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,440
Ashile Tribe will

635
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
be in a bad position.

636
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,600
Your Majesty,

637
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
Ashile Tribe is

638
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
clearly using the marriage contract

639
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,480
to attack Tang.

640
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,760
If we don't keep our promise,

641
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,160
how can we make all tribes of the desert

642
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,080
believe in us?

643
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,400
Your Majesty,

644
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I thought

645
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,800
the marriage contract with Princess Wan

646
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:35,080
was just a matter of

647
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,720
the future,

648
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
and soplease register the marriage contract

649
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,440
I've read the book.

650
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,040
I've only learned how to resist others.

651
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
Your Majesty.

652
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

653
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,400
I failed to stop Her Highness.

654
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

655
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,640
Why is Her Highness here?

656
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,680
You said it was a false alarm.

657
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,360
Your Majesty.

658
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
Her Highness told all the officials

659
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,320
that I've read the book.

660
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,840
But Her Highness told all the officials

661
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,400
that she was going to get married.

662
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,320
She has a right to be married

663
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,880
and she's being unreasonable.

664
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,080
I wonder what's the truth.

665
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,680
Her Highness is

666
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,360
the son of the Grand Imperial Envoy.

667
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,200
How could she be rude

668
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,480
to talk about the marriage of a princess?

669
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,200
It's the Grand Envoy of the Ministry of Rites, right?

670
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,880
Since my marriage

671
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,280
has become a big thing in the court,

672
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,880
as a subject of His Majesty,

673
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,400
I should be responsible for it.

674
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,120
Your Majesty.

675
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,640
I have something to say.

676
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,080
Go ahead.

677
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,720
Your Majesty.

678
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,040
Please forgive me for my misdeed.

679
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,640
Yongan is His Majesty's daughter.

680
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,000
But Yongan

681
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,880
is no different

682
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,320
from other concubines in Tang.

683
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,440
We came to this world

684
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,680
to serve our father, our king

685
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,280
and our country.

686
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,160
But we can't

687
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,520
live only for these.

688
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,760
We have a home and a country.

689
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,280
Tang is a prosperous country.

690
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,360
The prosperity can only be given to the people.

691
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,960
If Tang's prosperity

692
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,440
is a compromise,

693
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,600
how can we

694
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,040
serve the country

695
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,640
and our country?

696
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,080
That's right.

697
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,560
That's right.

698
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
That's nonsense.

699
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,120
Her Highness is clearly unwilling to get married.

700
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,760
Yes.

701
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,360
Your Majesty.

702
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,600
Princess Yongan is unwilling to get married.

703
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,360
You don't have to say it so openly.

704
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,560
The one who came to the Golden Ashile Tribe

705
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,640
is Princess Yicheng,

706
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,920
who was with her in the past.

707
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,680
Her Highness's actions

708
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,720
are admirable.

709
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,880
Is the princess of our dynasty

710
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,280
inferior to the princess of the previous dynasty?

711
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,200
You are so brave

712
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,680
and I admire you.

713
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,640
But what you said

714
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,120
really humiliated all the men in Tang.

715
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,520
You are so cruel.

716
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
You are so cruel.

717
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,600
You are so cruel.

718
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,080
Please speak.

719
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Do you know

720
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,360
how Princess Yicheng was hurt until today?

721
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,400
She is a princess of the previous dynasty.

722
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,920
She is living like a mule

723
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,440
on a strange grassland.

724
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,440
She has no dignity to speak.

725
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,440
She is weak and can be married.

726
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,840
She is afraid that the Ashile Tribe

727
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,240
will make such a sacrifice

728
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,640
to a weak girl.

729
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,960
There are thousands of good sons in Tang.

730
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,840
Are they afraid of being defeated by the strong enemy?

731
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,320
If Tang

732
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,720
can't even protect its own children,

733
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
how can the tribes of the desert

734
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,840
believe that Tang

735
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,080
can protect them?

736
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,440
Yes.

737
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,760
Why are you so sure?

738
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,480
What you said is right.

739
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,440
Come.

740
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,080
Lord.

741
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
Please rise.

742
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,200
Sit down.

743
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

744
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,920
Your Majesty.

745
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,360
I think what you said

746
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,440
is just a excuse to get married.

747
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
Du Qing.

748
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,200
What do you think?

749
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,960
As a weak girl,

750
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,440
you don't want to bow to the strong people

751
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,040
who come from the grassland.

752
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
I am very impressed

753
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,480
by what you said.

754
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
That explains a lot.

755
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,680
Fine.

756
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,200
In Asule's words,

757
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,040
Tang

758
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,520
is going to be handed over

759
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
to the princess with both hands.

760
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,920
Your Majesty is wise.

761
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,640
There are two contrary sides.

762
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,600
I think

763
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,440
Asule Tribe

764
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
is willing to take the thee decision

765
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,280
and will flee from

766
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
is a big deal.

767
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,240
If Ashile Tribe

768
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,640
betrays our Tang,

769
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,520
it's a small matter.

770
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,800
Our Tang

771
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,760
will never sacrifice a woman

772
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,280
to change the situation.

773
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,040
This is not

774
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,240
because Yongan is my daughter.

775
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,160
All the women in the world

776
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,200
are my people.

777
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,440
I

778
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,040
will never sacrifice anyone.

779
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,280
Yongan,

780
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,880
three days later,

781
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,840
you will go to the private library with me.

782
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,760
If Ashile Tribe

783
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,360
dares to mention this again,

784
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,840
you can tell them

785
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,680
that the deal is cancelled.

786
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:55,560
Awu...

787
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,560
Your Majesty!

788
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

789
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

790
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

791
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

792
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

793
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

794
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

795
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

796
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

797
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

798
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

799
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

800
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

801
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
I'm not afraid of anything.

802
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
You.

803
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Officials,

804
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
you've come a long way

805
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
to form a alliance.

806
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Thank you, everyone.

807
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Your Majesty,

808
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Yanli Khan is in a critical situation.

809
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Yanli Khan is in a critical situation.

810
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
So I asked you to ask Your Majesty

811
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
if you could

812
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
arrange the marriage of the whole family

813
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
and it will be decided.

814
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
It's not too late to talk about it.

815
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Khatun is not giving

816
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
His Majesty the face of the Tang Dynasty.

817
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Since Khan is sick,

818
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
he can't rest assured about this marriage.

819
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Then I'll give him an answer today.

820
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Tell Khatun for me.

821
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Thank you, Khan.

822
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Khatun, Ashile Bu Xiaokhan,

823
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
for your kindness and kindness.

824
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I can't match you.

825
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
I'm so grateful to you.

826
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
What's going on?

827
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
What's going on?

828
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
What's going on?

829
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
What's going on?

830
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
It's a matter of talent.

831
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Her Highness is getting married.

832
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Khatun is talented and beautiful.

833
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
What Yongan can do

834
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
is not as good as Khatun.

835
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
So I have to

836
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
give him a big chance.

837
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Do you think

838
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
now that the desert is everywhere,

839
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
you can give up

840
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
the old contract with me?

841
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
If there is another change,

842
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
will the Tang Dynasty

843
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
treat you like this?

844
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
It's impossible.

845
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
How can they treat us like this?

846
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
It's a happy thing.

847
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
It's clearly the Tang Dynasty

848
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
who wrote the engagement contract.

849
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
It's a good proof that

850
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
they are friends with Ashile Bu.

851
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Now the Tang Dynasty is ready to give up.

852
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
No matter what happens in the future,

853
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
we can't blame them.

854
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Why is everyone hesitating?

855
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
When everyone came to

856
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
the Chang'an Trade Union,

857
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
they said they were willing to fix it.

858
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
That means

859
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
everyone has the chance

860
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
to become the prince consort.

861
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
I can be the prince consort?

862
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
I can be the prince consort too?

863
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
What do you mean?

864
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
The Khan said that the marriage contract

865
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
is a proof that you are friends.

866
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Everyone here wants to be friends with Tang Dynasty.

867
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
If so,

868
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
the one who can do it will know.

869
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Why don't we let the Tang Dynasty hold a competition?

870
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
It's fair for us.

871
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Great.

872
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Only the winner

873
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
can match Princess Yongan.

874
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Khan, do you dare to come to the competition?

875
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
What's wrong, Khan?

876
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Are you scared?

877
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

878
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
How can I be scared?

879
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Great.

880
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
You are a young hero.

881
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
If so,

882
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
I will set up a trap here tomorrow.

883
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Where are the heroes from?

884
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
They can all compete.

885
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
The one who is not the winner

886
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
will be my Yongan.

887
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,440
In my dream,

888
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
before dawn,

889
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
before the years,

890
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,440
my longing flows.

891
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,440
There is always a moment

892
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,440
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

893
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,440
There is always a longing

894
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,440
that is in between you and me.

895
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
In each other's world,

896
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
in different worlds,

897
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I am missing you.

898
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,440
My longing is like a cocoon

899
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
that is getting deeper and deeper.

900
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:47,440
It has become a permanent cocoon.

901
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,440
There is always a moment

902
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,440
that burns down the wastelands in my heart.

903
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,440
There is always a longing

904
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,440
that is in between you and me.

905
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
In each other's world,

906
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
in different worlds,

907
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,440
I am missing you.

908
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,440
My longing is like a cocoon

909
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
that is getting deeper and deeper.

910
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:33,440
It has become a permanent cocoon.
