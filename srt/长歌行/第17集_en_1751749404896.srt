1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
My heart is burning

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Like the distance

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
The past is like a dagger

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
This broken wing

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Still have to fly

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Following the direction of light

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Forgetting

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,600
The memory of this is the look of my stubbornness

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,600
I want to use the light in the dark night

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
To return to the long hope in the dark night

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Climbing the river of life and the crazy of the past

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,800
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
The Asher Tribe's women

14
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Hao Du sent people to follow

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
The Chihou saw it with her own eyes

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Princess Yong Ning was killed by the Asher Tribe

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Get up

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
What time is it? Still sleeping

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Get up

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
What time is it?

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
This kid

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Let's go

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Little lady

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
After this dinner, you should leave

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
I can't afford this kind of case

26
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Lady

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I don't dare to go out

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Or you take me in

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I can do anything

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
I said I would leave in one day

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Why are you still here?

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
No

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Leave after dinner

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Lady

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm going back to Chang'an

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I will leave in a few days

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
I can do anything

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
You have done something

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
But I can embroider

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Embroider

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
The bag you embroidered

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Is the ugliest bag I've ever seen

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
If you embroider it

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
My branch will be closed sooner or later

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
No, no, no

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Lady

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
That bag

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
That bag was embroidered by my best friend

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I really know how to embroider

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
You are delicate

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
You don't look like a rough guy

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm talking about the front

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Staying is not impossible

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I don't have much salary for you

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Right?

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Stop

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Come and listen to me

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I want to introduce to you

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
This lady is

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Li Leyan

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
From today

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
She will work with you

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
You said yesterday

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
She will leave in one day

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm in a good mood today

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Can't I?

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Yes, you can

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
But she doesn't know how to do anything

70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Don't tell anyone

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I told her

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Because she has the lowest salary

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
She is the most beautiful

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
She likes it

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Enough

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
She has never done anything

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
So today

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
She will help you

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Leave

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Come

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Go, go, go

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Master Wei

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
From today

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I will teach you

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
She will learn from you

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
You teach her

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
You learn from her

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Okay, I will teach her

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
This is a rope

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
This is a rope

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Step on your feet

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Pass through

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Like this

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Step on it

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you know how to do it?

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Tegin

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
The camp in Shuozhou has been set up

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Do you want to send it to the tent?

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I don't think so

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Find some more reliable people to send it

101
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Yes

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
You go there in person?

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Such a big attack

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You don't go to the big man

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
To show your loyalty

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Otherwise, with his suspicious personality

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
He will think you have other ideas

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I have never been to the king

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
This time

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
He will have an idea

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I have something to tell you

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
You see

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Sun doesn't want to talk to you

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
You go

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I can be your military counselor

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
You are so arrogant

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Who do you think you are?

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Is it your call to be a military counselor?

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't provoke my relationship with Sun

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
You

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Reason

123
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Since you are a special envoy for Tegin

124
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
You are the chief of Tegin

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Then I will be useful

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I learned it in the plan

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Tegin took me back to the grassland

128
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Must have been interested in me

129
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Shisi is not talented

130
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Can't recognize himself

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
The underlings are defeated

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I don't want to talk

133
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Tell me

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Why should I invite you

135
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
An outsider like you

136
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Be my counselor

137
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Actually, this way

138
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I have been thinking about a problem

139
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Great Khan let Eagle Division

140
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
As the vanguard of attacking Shuozhou

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
But

142
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Tegin didn't bring it

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
To attack the city

144
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
And

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
He didn't fight with Tang before

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
So it seems

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Great Khan doesn't care about the result

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Maybe

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
He hopes you lose

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Nonsense

151
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Go on

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
It reminds me of

153
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
The situation in Shuozhou

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Eagle Division is fighting with Bear Division

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Even in Ming Chu

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
If no one supports Bear Division

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
It's hard for him to move your army

158
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
After all

159
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
You are Great Khan's foster son

160
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
What do you want to say

161
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
It seems I guessed right

162
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Tegin is in Ashile Tribe's position

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Not as stable as outsiders think

164
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
But after all you are Great Khan's foster son

165
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
And hold the heavy army

166
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
You don't have any thoughts, do you

167
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm loyal to Great Khan

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Great Khan trusts me

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You don't have to argue with me

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Tegin said this

171
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Does Great Khan believe it

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Does Great Khan's son believe it

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
How do you know this

174
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
So now

175
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Tegin thinks I have the right to know everything

176
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
What's your condition

177
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
I can help you to make three wishes

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
But

179
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I can't hurt Tang

180
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I can't do anything bad

181
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
After I finish three things

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Please let me leave the grassland

183
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Ok

184
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Sun

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
From today

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
You are no longer a slave

187
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
But I won't help you

188
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
You need to live on your own

189
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
After you finish three things

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I will let you go

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
After

192
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
If you still want to take revenge on me

193
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I will be at your service

194
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Have you made up your mind to make three wishes

195
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
No

196
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
But it's like a wish

197
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
When I think it over

198
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
When

199
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
You help me make it

200
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Ok

201
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I promise you

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
But as I said just now

203
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Can't harm Tang

204
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Can't do anything bad

205
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
During this time

206
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I will rely on my own ability

207
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Stand firm in the Eagle Division

208
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Please wait and see

209
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
It's a deal

210
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Unleash his iron chain

211
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
The Eagle Division

212
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Stop working

213
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
It's been a long day

214
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I bought some pastries

215
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Let's share

216
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Pastries

217
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Pastries

218
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Come on

219
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Come on

220
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Thank you

221
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Thank you

222
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Thank you

223
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Why are you so generous today

224
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Yes

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
You can't bear to sell pastries

226
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
But there is a deal

227
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
That's right

228
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
There is a businessman named Hu

229
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
He ordered a batch of pastries

230
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
It's delicious

231
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
He made us eat for months

232
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Really

233
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Great

234
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
So you need to work hard

235
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
After eating pastries, you need to work

236
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Ok

237
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Let's go

238
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Let's go

239
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Delicious

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Miss Li

241
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
You should eat some pastries too

242
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
We will work later

243
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Don't worry

244
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
You are a newbie

245
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I don't have any requirements for you

246
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
It's not a big deal

247
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Just do it

248
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Miss Chai

249
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
If it's not done

250
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I can make it again

251
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
It's ok

252
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Eat some pastries first

253
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
We will do it later

254
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Li Leyan

255
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
What did you make for me

256
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Look

257
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Look at it

258
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I will make it again

259
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Don't

260
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Don't do it

261
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
My ancestors

262
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I beg you

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Look at it

264
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
It's full of blood

265
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Really

266
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I

267
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Forget it

268
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Great Khan suddenly came

269
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
And brought Sher with him

270
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Great Khan never comes to us

271
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
In the first place

272
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I have a big thing to do

273
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Could it be Shuozhou

274
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Shuozhou

275
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
It's a deal that I made with Gongsun Heng

276
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
You don't know anything

277
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
It has nothing to do with the Eagle Division's brothers

278
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Do you understand

279
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
What do you want

280
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
I have promised Gongsun Heng

281
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I have long thought of today

282
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
I made all these decisions

283
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
If Great Khan insists on making troubles

284
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
You just need to keep your name

285
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Have you thought about it

286
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
A way to get back on your feet

287
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
No one is completely sure

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Try your best

289
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Prepare a strategy

290
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
To welcome Great Khan

291
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Hurry up

292
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Li Shisi

293
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Don't bother me

294
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Tell me what happened

295
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I don't know

296
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Don't play dumb with me

297
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What are you doing

298
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I want to know the truth

299
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
It's a single decision to pardon Shuozhou

300
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Great Khan doesn't know

301
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
If it were Great Khan

302
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Shuozhou would have been lost

303
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
It looks like

304
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
It's a big deal

305
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Sun Ping'er looks like

306
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
It's really a heartless look

307
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
But in private

308
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
The one who values friendship the most

309
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
He knew that the leader of Shuozhou was you

310
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
The one who was on the wall

311
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
He deliberately shot him

312
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
He was afraid that his own swordsmanship was too good

313
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
He kept pulling me to confirm

314
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Are you okay

315
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
And before you left Shuozhou

316
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Zhang Tie reported

317
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Said you assassinated the leader of Ashile Tribe Wei Guo

318
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
You have been executed and donated to the people

319
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Just to keep your reputation as the leader of Shuozhou

320
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
What about you

321
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
How did you treat him

322
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I won't give you a free ride

323
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
This time Great Khan came

324
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
He did disobey Great Khan's order

325
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
And Sher

326
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Is Sun's enemy

327
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
If he succeeds

328
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Sun will be dead

329
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I have to find a way to save him

330
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Did Ashile Sun say

331
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
How to deal with him

332
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I don't know

333
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Great Khan

334
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Welcome Great Khan

335
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Get up

336
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I don't know what father ordered to marry Eagle Division this time

337
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
No need to be anxious

338
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Sit down

339
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Yes

340
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Sun

341
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
It's been a long time since we met

342
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I'm just having a moment to come and see

343
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Now Eagle Division is strong and strong

344
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
The military is very strong

345
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Not bad

346
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I am very worried

347
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Ashile Tribe is prosperous

348
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
It's all because of father

349
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
What I rely on

350
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Is also father's grace

351
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
My Sun said that

352
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
It's too much

353
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I dare not say that

354
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Father has always heard

355
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Said Sun is the god of war on the grassland

356
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I thought it was just a compliment

357
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Never thought

358
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Eagle Division first fought with Great Tang

359
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Within ten days

360
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Take over Shuozhou City and return

361
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
My Sun

362
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Really have no qualms about the god of war

363
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Ashile Tribe is famous

364
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Eagle Division can successfully capture Shuozhou

365
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
That's natural

366
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Ashile Sun

367
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
What you said is getting more and more beautiful

368
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
But you don't seem to be telling the truth

369
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
What do you mean

370
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Shuozhou has always been a hard bone

371
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Shu Han has been punished for many years

372
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Never been able to get it

373
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Why did you go

374
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
They just opened the city gate for you

375
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Shu Han

376
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Don't you think it's strange

377
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Shier

378
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Then you tell me

379
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
What's strange

380
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Just say it

381
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Great Khan once had a command

382
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
After taking the city

383
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Must destroy the military power in the city

384
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Is the military source

385
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Shuozhou is the place where the North Pass is located

386
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Only in this way

387
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
We can give Li Tang no trouble

388
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
But how did I hear that after you attacked the city

389
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Not only buried the governor Gongsun Hang

390
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Also let go of everyone in the city

391
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Ashile Sun

392
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Is it your greed for life and fear of death

393
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Let you want to betray me

394
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Sun

395
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Is there such a thing

396
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Yes

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I ordered it

398
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Shu Han, you heard it

399
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
He admitted that he betrayed you

400
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Betrayed Ashile

401
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Is Fu Han suspecting my loyalty

402
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
He knew that the leader of Shuozhou was you

403
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
The one who was on the wall

404
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
He deliberately shot the film

405
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
He was afraid that his own swordsmanship was too good

406
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Always pulling me to confirm

407
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Are you okay

408
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
And Sher's guy

409
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Is Sun's enemy

410
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
If he succeeds in his plan

411
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Sun will definitely die

412
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Even if Ashile Sun

413
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Didn't fully fulfill Great Khan's order

414
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
But after all

415
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Win at such a small price

416
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
No matter what

417
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
It's not a crime

418
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Great Khan specially went to the door to commit crimes

419
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
It won't be so simple

420
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
What is it for

421
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Go get some water

422
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes

423
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
If it's not because Great Khan wants to use you

424
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I will beat you to death

425
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
You are from the Central Plains

426
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
If you want to be like this

427
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Or like that

428
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
You really take yourself as a person

429
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Sooner or later you will have a chance to clean up

430
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Central Plains

431
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Why did Great Khan bring a Central Plains person

432
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh no

433
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
If Great Khan doesn't trust you

434
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
He won't give you a chance to change yourself

435
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Thank you, Great Khan

436
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
This is a letter from the governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng

437
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Written by me

438
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm sorry

439
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm sorry

440
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
This is a letter from the governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng

441
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Written by me

442
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Please check it out

443
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Gongsun Heng has been guarding the border for many years

444
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Our tribe repeatedly lost to this person

445
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
We lost heavily

446
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
If we want to attack Shuozhou this time

447
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
I don't know how much damage I will suffer

448
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
This time Gongsun Heng pleaded for peace

449
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
He is willing to ask for a change of people

450
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
He means

451
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Not only can it pull out the new thorns in our tribe

452
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
And we can at the lowest cost

453
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Replace the biggest victory

454
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
So Sun agreed

455
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
You even let the Tang army go

456
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Still here to quibble

457
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Shuozhou army is badly injured

458
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
The city is old and weak

459
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
There is no fighting power

460
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
If not

461
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Gongsun Heng will not make this request

462
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Gongsun Heng sent his own head as promised

463
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Take the initiative to open the city

464
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
As the son of my father

465
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
How can I be a person who believes in the seven wings

466
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Father

467
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Please see

468
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
This is Gongsun Heng's first level

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
And all the list of occupants

470
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Please check it out

471
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I am confident

472
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
OK

473
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
No more contract

474
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Sun

475
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
You did the right thing

476
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The descendants of our grasslands

477
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Every generation is upside down

478
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,880
You're so bold.

479
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,680
Gongsun Heng

480
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,280
is a worthy opponent.

481
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,000
You should bury him

482
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,720
in the grassland

483
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
as I said.

484
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,920
Yes, father.

485
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,320
Sun.

486
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,320
I have another question

487
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
for you.

488
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,760
The

489
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
The

490
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
The

491
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
The

492
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
The

493
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
The

494
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
The

495
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
The

496
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
What are you doing?

497
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Don't think you're not a slave now.

498
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
You can do anything to me.

499
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Nu'er.

500
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
You have to help me.

501
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
You really don't take yourself as an outsider.

502
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Listen.

503
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
If you don't help me,

504
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
you, Tegin

505
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
and the whole Eagle Division

506
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
will be in trouble.

507
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm sorry.

508
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Ashile Sun.

509
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
If you confess,

510
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
I can ask Shu Han for punishment.

511
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

512
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
You really don't see the coffin and don't cry.

513
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Shu Han.

514
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Ashile Sun.

515
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
He colluded with Tang

516
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
and stopped me.

517
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
You're lying.

518
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I was going to win in Youzhou.

519
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Ashile Sun.

520
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
You secretly sent a envoy

521
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
to take him back to the garden.

522
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
You know that Youzhou is back to Tang.

523
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
You let my Wolf Division lose.

524
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
You actually

525
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
betrayed Great Khan and colluded with Tang.

526
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Why are you pretending to be loyal?

527
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Sun.

528
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Is this really true?

529
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I swear to the God of Heaven.

530
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
This is definitely not true.

531
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Shu Han.

532
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
There is a rebel general.

533
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
He escaped from being taken by the Tang army

534
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
back to Chang'an.

535
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
He was finally taken by me.

536
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
This man was Wang Junkuo,

537
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
the son of King Lujiang.

538
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Little Khan.

539
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
You messed up the Youzhou thing.

540
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Now you're throwing dirt on Sun Tegin.

541
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
What are you doing?

542
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Father.

543
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Back off.

544
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Ashile Sun.

545
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
You should be very familiar with him.

546
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
If you haven't done anything,

547
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
do you dare to fight him?

548
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Shu Han.

549
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
My brothers in the Wolf Division

550
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
died too far away.

551
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I won't let him get away with this.

552
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Come.

553
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Bring the rebel here.

554
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Yes.

555
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I probably went crazy

556
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
before I came here with you.

557
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
It's impossible for you

558
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
to do anything

559
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
under Great Khan's eyes.

560
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Sun Tegin can't protect you.

561
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Who said I was going to do anything?

562
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
You're not going to do anything?

563
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
You're going to do something?

564
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
I really am going to do something.

565
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
I'll call Little Khan's

566
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
cavalry later.

567
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
I'll distract the guards.

568
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
You'll take care of the rest.

569
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
What do you mean?

570
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I'm just here to help.

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
The man that Little Khan brought

572
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
is the general of Youzhou.

573
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
He's seen me before.

574
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
I can't go in.

575
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
You have to come.

576
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Are you serious?

577
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
I'll teach you how to do it.

578
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Come.

579
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Wait until I go in.

580
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Can I do this?

581
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
I'll leave it to you.

582
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Little Khan's horse ran away.

583
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Little Khan's horse ran away.

584
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Go after it.

585
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Ashile Sun,

586
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
have you thought it through?

587
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
If you confess your crime to Shu Han now,

588
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
maybe Shu Han will

589
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
spare your life

590
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
for the sake of old feelings.

591
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
When the King's army is ready,

592
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
we'll tell everything clearly.

593
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
But it's not

594
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
as simple as it seems.

595
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
You can't do anything

596
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
without me.

597
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
I'll go.

598
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I'll go.

599
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
It's not easy to admit it.

600
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
You don't think for yourself.

601
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
You should think for Eagle Division.

602
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Sun,

603
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
as long as you confess your crime

604
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
and tell everything clearly,

605
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Father Khan will forgive you.

606
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
I have no qualms.

607
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
I didn't do anything

608
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
that would hurt Father Khan.

609
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Great Khan has arrived.

610
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Bring him in.

611
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I'm Wang Junkuo.

612
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Greetings, Great Khan.

613
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Tell everything clearly

614
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
about Youzhou.

615
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Wang Junkuo,

616
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
did you see Ashile Sun

617
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
in Youzhou?

618
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Great Khan, please tell me clearly.

619
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
I really don't have those things.

620
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
I gave the key to Young Khan.

621
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
All the things

622
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
were taken by Young Khan.

623
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
The stockade was lost.

624
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I think

625
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
only Young Khan knows it best.

626
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Tell everything clearly.

627
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Wang Junkuo,

628
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
what are you talking about?

629
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Tell everything clearly.

630
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
What did you do

631
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
when you saw Ashile Sun

632
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
in Youzhou?

633
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Great Khan, please tell me clearly.

634
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I really don't have those things.

635
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
How could I

636
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
take the stockade without permission?

637
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
The things...

638
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
The things must be with Young Khan.

639
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
He followed Sun Tegin all the way.

640
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I think he must have something on him.

641
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Great Khan.

642
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Ashile Sun

643
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
took the city of Shuozhou

644
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
within ten days.

645
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
You deserve a great reward.

646
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Take half of the war power

647
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
of Shuozhou.

648
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Thank you, Great Khan.

649
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Song'er,

650
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
I think

651
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
you are short of men.

652
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
When I go back,

653
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I will select

654
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
a good female slave for you

655
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
and send her to your tent.

656
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Thank you, Great Khan.

657
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Sher.

658
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Great Khan.

659
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
You did a great job this time.

660
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Great Khan.

661
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Great Khan, please listen to me.

662
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Youzhou

663
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
It's scary.

664
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
You did a great job.

665
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
How do you know

666
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
about the stockade of Youzhou?

667
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Wang Junkuo listened to Young Khan

668
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
and wanted to

669
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
keep the stockade of Youzhou

670
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
on his waist.

671
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
he was so nervous.

672
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
He didn't expect that he would lose the chance.

673
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,200
Actually, the silver wasn't with him.

674
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,240
But Wang Junkuo didn't know anything.

675
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
He has nothing now.

676
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
That's why he's more careful.

677
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,440
He was afraid that Great Khan would suspect that he stole the silver

678
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
and tried to bite him.

679
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,040
Actually, I just wanted to bet.

680
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,680
I didn't expect that I would win this time.

681
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,160
It must be your luck

682
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
that you bet on me.

683
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,800
God bless you.

684
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,160
Military counselor, you're so good.

685
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,240
You not only saved Tegin,

686
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,520
but also the whole Eagle Division.

687
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,600
I'm so happy for you.

688
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,640
From now on,

689
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,200
we're on the same side.

690
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,840
I knew you were here.

691
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
Every time Great Khan did something to you

692
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
because of Sher,

693
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,160
you were just here,

694
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,440
saying nothing.

695
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,760
You didn't solve

696
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,120
today's problem, right?

697
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,760
What?

698
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,600
You look down on me?

699
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,760
Fine.

700
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,240
Li Shisi solved it.

701
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,480
He's the only one who's good at using people's hearts.

702
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,440
I don't know where he got it from.

703
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,160
But the most important thing on the grassland

704
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,480
is to take the advantage.

705
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,960
It's just a matter of luck.

706
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,640
Thanks to my wisdom,

707
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
I told him everything

708
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,480
you did in Shuozhou.

709
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
Otherwise, he wouldn't help you.

710
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,840
You...

711
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,120
Wait.

712
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,640
Where are you going?

713
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,040
Sun.

714
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
Good sheep are here.

715
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,840
Come.

716
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,120
You told me to keep an eye on Li Shisi.

717
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,560
I think it's too late.

718
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,360
What do you mean?

719
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,880
They were living in the same tent.

720
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,520
Today, they broke Sher's conspiracy.

721
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,240
They're just having a fight.

722
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,360
Look at Nuer.

723
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
He's giving her food and drinks again.

724
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,040
Good wine.

725
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
Good wine.

726
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,960
Wuji.

727
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,880
Arrange a separate tent for Li Shisi.

728
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,840
Okay.

729
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,880
I'll go tomorrow.

730
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,160
When?

731
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,280
Right now.

732
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,000
What's wrong with me

733
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,520
if I don't arrange it?

734
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,080
Forget it.

735
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm a man of great power.

736
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,000
Here, another one.

737
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,920
Here.

738
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,760
It's delicious.

739
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,360
How is it?

740
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,720
Why are you here?

741
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,160
The lamb leg is just roasted.

742
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Come and try it.

743
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
What's wrong with you?

744
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
You've been bribed

745
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,280
for just one day.

746
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,320
B...b...bribed?

747
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,360
Don't talk nonsense.

748
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,480
What's wrong?

749
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,120
You don't like me

750
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,000
getting along with you?

751
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,640
I don't.

752
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,320
Some people don't.

753
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,880
Pack up and come with me.

754
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,480
Where are you taking me?

755
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,720
Now that you're a military counselor,

756
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,920
how can you live with Nuer?

757
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,680
Come on.

758
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,640
I've prepared a big and good tent for you.

759
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,960
Interesting.

760
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,680
Try it.

761
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,720
Feeling better?

762
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,560
Yes.

763
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,400
Forget it.

764
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,800
I have no room.

765
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,240
Then when can I sleep with you?

766
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,520
I can go first.

767
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,920
Thanks.

768
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,280
I'll come back to you.

769
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Don't you feel ashamed to buy me a drink?

770
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I know you look down on me

771
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,720
You think I'm just a cowardly young master

772
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
If it weren't for my father

773
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I might be inferior to a civil official in your eyes

774
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Right?

775
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,720
I'm asking you, right?

776
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Yes

777
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
You're drunk

778
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
I'll tell you another thing

779
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Actually, Changge looks down on me

780
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Otherwise, for so many years

781
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
She wouldn't understand my feelings

782
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
You still think about Li Changge

783
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I thought you were worried about the princess

784
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm worried

785
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I'm afraid

786
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I feel guilty

787
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
I lost Leyan

788
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
I haven't found her yet

789
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Changge is dead

790
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
I didn't see her for the last time

791
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I look down on myself

792
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Come on, sit down

793
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Drink with me

794
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Drink

795
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
No

796
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
You look tired

797
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
You're drunk

798
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
You're sad

799
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Hao Du

800
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
I pity you

801
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
You're just a puppet

802
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,720
A puppet of your father

803
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,720
A puppet of your father

804
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Wei Shuyu

805
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
If you talk nonsense again, I'll be rude to you

806
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Answer me

807
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
I want you to beat me to death

808
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
If I can't find Leyan

809
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
I won't go back to Chang'an

810
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,720
I'll be ashamed to see my father

811
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Go

812
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Young master, you're awake

813
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
How is the princess?

814
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I didn't find her

815
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
She left

816
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
What?

817
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
She left?

818
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Yes

819
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
She said it was a waste of time

820
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
She left early in the morning

821
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Where did she go?

822
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
I don't know

823
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Young master

824
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Young master

825
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Where are you going?

826
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
I'm going to find the princess

827
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Go

828
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Your Majesty

829
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Wei Qing

830
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Come

831
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
We've known each other for a long time

832
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
You don't have to stand on ceremony

833
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm ashamed to say that

834
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
The citizens need your help

835
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Your Majesty

836
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I'll do my best

837
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Come

838
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Your Majesty

839
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
I know everything about Jingzhou

840
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Luo Yi and Jiancheng have always been close

841
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
I know everything

842
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I know

843
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Luo Yi and Jiancheng have always been close

844
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Tianjie Army under his command

845
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
have done a great job for Tang for years

846
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
The citizens know

847
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Wei Qing doesn't want to see the court

848
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
do these meritorious deeds

849
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
But now

850
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
You're wrong

851
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
I'm not a fool who only thinks about old feelings

852
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
and doesn't know loyalty

853
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
No

854
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
The citizens just think

855
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,720
You don't want to see me

856
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
kill Luo Yi

857
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
On the contrary

858
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
After the emperor ascended the throne

859
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
He has already set up the world

860
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Luo Yi didn't care about the grace of heaven

861
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
and revolted

862
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Jingzhou is the place to defend

863
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Ashile Tribe

864
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
If you don't kill Luo Yi and his Tianjie Army

865
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,720
now

866
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
I'll kill Wang Junkuo and his army

867
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
I'm afraid

868
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,720
I'll have to repeat the same thing again

869
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
In addition

870
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
I also got the news

871
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,720
The traitor Wang Junkuo escaped to Ashile Tribe

872
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
But I don't know why

873
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
he was killed by Ashile people

874
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Your Majesty

875
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
You can't hesitate now

876
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Wang Junkuo

877
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,720
I'm really ashamed of myself

878
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm not afraid of death

879
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
I heard Wei Qing say that today

880
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
The citizens are relieved

881
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,720
But if Tianjie Army is defeated

882
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Ashile people will be defeated

883
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
If you don't move Jingzhou

884
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Is our Tang stable?

885
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Without Jingzhou

886
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Ashile people

887
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
won't move troops to our Tang

888
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Your Majesty

889
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
No matter it's soft or hard

890
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
You can't let Ashile people give up

891
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,720
their ambition for Central Plains

892
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I understand

893
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,720
I'll summon General Yuchi to the palace

894
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Your Majesty, don't worry

895
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
No matter what the result is

896
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,720
We will advance and retreat together

897
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
By the way

898
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,720
When Wei Qing was looking for Yan'er

899
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
He must have suffered a lot

900
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
I'll arrange more people to look for him

901
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Let him come back first

902
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
I have other arrangements

903
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,720
I haven't received his letter for many days

904
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,720
I didn't find the princess

905
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I can't face her

906
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,720
You are usually too strict with Shuyi

907
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,720
I think she is eager to find Yan'er

908
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,720
She will hurt her body

909
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Fang Qing's family needs a supervisor

910
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I think she is suitable

911
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Your Majesty, don't do that

912
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Shuyi has made many mistakes

913
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
It's settled

914
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Your Majesty

915
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,720
I thank you for your kind words

916
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I'm going to go back now

917
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
I'll go back to the palace

918
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Li Leyan

919
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
You are so full

920
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
What are you doing?

921
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Just embroidering

922
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
You are so considerate

923
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Why didn't you put more effort

924
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
to be more active?

925
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
I will learn it soon

926
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm worried about these things

927
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
In the palace?

928
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
She is dreaming about being a princess again

929
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Princess

930
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Are there gold beads in the palace?

931
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Little lady

932
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Have you ever had a stroke

933
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
or had a serious illness?

934
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Why are you talking nonsense?

935
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Let's invite the doctor to see the child

936
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Let's talk to Lady Chai

937
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
Don't shoot her head in the future

938
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
It's stupid

939
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm sorry

940
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I'll leave these maids to you

941
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
You can take care of the rest

942
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
What's going on?

943
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
This is a female slave from the battle

944
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
She said it was a reward for our special Qin

945
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
There is no female slave in the special Qin battle

946
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Take her away

947
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Great Khan really gave us a slap

948
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
It's a pity

949
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Who knows if it's poisonous

950
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
The things sent by the war

951
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
are always difficult to deal with

952
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Send someone to keep an eye on them

953
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Don't walk around

954
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
OK

955
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Mother

956
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
Look back at me

957
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Mother

958
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Look back at me

959
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Look back at me

960
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Let me go

961
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Let me go

962
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Let me go

963
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
