Episode 16

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello, aunt.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you the boy on the court today?

4
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,000
I didn't mean to go on the court.

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
But the situation was not good for us.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,600
So,

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
I had to sing.

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Well done.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You not only got the sword today,

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
but also gave me a gold medal.

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Your grandfather heard this news and called me to the palace.

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
He praised me a lot.

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,400
He even gave me many awards.

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,600
I didn't expect that you, a little girl,

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,800
would be more righteous than your five brothers.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Thank you for your praise.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Changge,

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,800
where is the sword of Ashile Tribe now?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Send it to my room.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to take a closer look.

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,600
I'll give the sword to my uncle.

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,400
What?

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Good.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
You're a filial child.

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
The Crown Princess has raised you up.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Now you have a baby.

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
You even send it to someone else's house.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Uncle is not someone else's house.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Li Shimin is not someone else's.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm someone else's.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
How dare you speak for him?

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Changge,

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
from now on,

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I don't want to hear you mention

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,600
anything about the Qin's Mansion.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Uncle, you misunderstood.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,400
I...

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
Calm down, Your Highness.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Calm down, Your Highness.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Mr. Wei.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Mr. Wei,

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
you finally remember to see me.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,000
Your Highness,

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
the Princess is still young.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
Why do you have to be angry with her?

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,600
This bastard.

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
He has a heart for the King of Qin.

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
I think

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,800
he will be fine after growing up.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,200
Your Highness.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
Wei Zheng,

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
cut the crap.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Come with me.

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Yes.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Go.

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Go to the King of Qin's Mansion.

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Tell Yuan Ji and Su to come to see me.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Yes.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Mother.

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,200
Stop.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,000
You won't listen to me, will you?

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
How did I tell you yesterday?

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
I just...

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,800
You just went out of the palace and pretended to be a player

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,800
and went out in front of Ashile people, right?

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Mother,

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
I won that game today.

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
I won.

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
I won that game today.

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Father said

71
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Grandfather praised me...

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
You've never played the game before?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You've been out of control since childhood.

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,000
You've been causing trouble everywhere.

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
It's all because I didn't teach you well

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,400
that you're more and more fearless now.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,200
You actually went to fight against the men.

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
So what if I'm a man?

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
So what if I'm a woman?

80
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Mother, you're born to sing.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Why do you always think singing is inferior to men?

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm good at both singing and dancing.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
I can go wherever I want.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Mother.

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Come with me.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come with me.

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Come with me.

89
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Kneel down.

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Mother.

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Kneel down.

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
I want you to rise up here.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
From now on,

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,400
no matter what happens,

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
no matter what happens,

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
I want you to have no regrets in your life.

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
I've never hated anyone.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
I want you to swear.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Okay.

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
I swear.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
But if anyone dares to hurt mother,

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll hate him.

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
No one hurts mother.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
I just hope you

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,400
can live happily and freely in this life.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
May you be separated from your family

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
and live a peaceful life.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,000
As long as you're by my side,

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
I'll be the happiest.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
I want you to remember

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
what you said here.

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay.

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,200
I'll remember it.

114
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Okay.

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Go back and pack up.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,200
I'll send you to Piyou Ming Hall tomorrow.

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
You'll be in the study for ten days.

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
You can't escape.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Mother.

120
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
This is a must.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
You can't change it.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Mother.

123
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,400
Report to the imperial doctor.

124
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,200
The Crown Prince has been the enemy of the King of Qin for a long time.

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,800
I wonder which prince is the Emperor of Tang.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,800
The King of Qi is about to lead troops to Wucheng,

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and his army is on the way.

128
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't know yet.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Has the King of Qi made any movements recently?

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Nothing special.

131
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
He just goes to the Eastern Palace every night.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's said that the King of Qi and the Crown Prince have always been friends.

133
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,200
It's not a common thing.

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not a common thing?

135
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Keep an eye on them.

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Don't reveal the whereabouts.

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
All the details

138
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
must be reported to me.

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Including

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
the whereabouts of the Crown Prince.

141
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes.

142
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
The new life is different.

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
The change of the King of Zheng

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
is the world.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Wei Che.

146
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm going to the palace to see the Emperor.

147
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Yes.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Princess.

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
This is the pastries that Madam made for you all night.

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,400
They are your favorite food.

151
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
And

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
these are the clothes that Madam sewed herself.

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
I just went for a few days and came back soon.

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
Mother...

155
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Madam didn't sleep at all.

156
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
She cares about you more than anyone else.

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,000
If that's the case,

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
why didn't Mother come?

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Madam

160
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
is very worried about you.

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
She is worried about you.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
Why didn't you come?

163
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Madam is tired.

164
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,600
Third Mother,

165
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Leyan doesn't know that I'm leaving.

166
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Tell him

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,800
to wait for me.

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't worry.

169
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
You and the Princess have been friends since childhood.

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
He won't be angry.

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,600
Third Mother,

172
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm leaving.

173
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Take care of yourself

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
and Mother.

175
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I will.

176
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Here.

177
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Take it.

178
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Mother.

179
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Mother,

180
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
you asked me to leave.

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
You came to see me off.

182
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Changge,

183
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Piyong Hall is not like the Dugu.

184
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
The servants are not so meticulous.

185
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Can you take care of yourself?

186
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
The food is not to your liking.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Can you make yourself

188
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
a few delicious dishes?

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
If your clothes are torn,

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
I can't sew it for you.

191
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Just follow what I taught you

192
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
and learn it slowly.

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
If it rains or snows,

194
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
don't touch it.

195
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Mother,

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
I won't leave.

197
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
I won't leave you step by step.

198
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Okay?

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
No.

200
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
Leave now.

201
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
You can't come back

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
without my permission.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
Mother.

204
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
Mother.

205
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm leaving.

206
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Mother.

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Changge,

208
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
can you

209
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
call me Mother again?

210
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Mother.

211
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Madam,

212
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
why is this?

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
I can't bear to part with Her Grace.

214
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Only by doing this

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
can she live well.

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Tomorrow, the delegation will leave the city.

217
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
It's Xin Sili

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
who will lead the horse to the north.

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
The situation in the capital will be very difficult.

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll stay here

221
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,800
and continue to investigate the military situation.

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sir.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Close the Xuanwu Gate and lock it.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Go.

226
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
No.

227
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,200
This is not the way to the north.

228
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
It's not the direction of Piyong.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
Did we go the wrong way?

230
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Isn't this the way to Piyong?

231
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
It is Piyong.

232
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Don't worry, Your Grace.

233
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Her Grace ordered me

234
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,600
to send you

235
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,400
to the right place safely.

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Mother has been acting strange since yesterday.

237
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Where is she sending me now?

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Go.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No.

240
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Mother never does this.

241
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,200
She must be hiding something from me.

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Go.

243
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Blood.

244
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
What's going on?

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Where is she?

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Why is there so much blood?

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why?

248
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Why?

249
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
Why is there no one?

250
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Mother.

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Mother, don't be hurt.

252
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Go.

253
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Go.

254
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Go.

255
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Go.

256
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Go.

257
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
What's going on?

258
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
Is there something wrong?

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Mother.

260
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Mother.

261
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Uncle.

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,960
The

263
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
Report.

264
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
All the beads of Li Jiancheng have been taken out.

265
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
General Yuchi has gone to protect the emperor.

266
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Mother.

267
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Guards.

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Master.

269
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
Send someone to the Eastern Palace.

270
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
The Crown Prince must get up there.

271
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Yes.

272
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,200
Go.

273
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
It's too late.

274
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
It's too late.

275
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,200
Jiancheng, it's too late.

276
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You.

277
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Leave.

278
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Go.

279
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Go.

280
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Jiancheng.

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,600
You and the Crown Prince have spoken less.

282
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
What's the meaning of this letter?

283
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
You come to interrogate.

284
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I come to save you.

285
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,600
I don't need you to save me.

286
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,600
Then why do you still want to speak to the Crown Prince again?

287
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Since then, I have been loyal to the emperor.

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,800
This is the duty of my Wei Zheng Yingjing.

289
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,800
I have done everything you should do.

290
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
You.

291
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,200
I came here to stop you.

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
I appeared in your mansion.

293
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
The outside world will think you have been softened.

294
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
You can save your loyal people.

295
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
You can also save your life.

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't need it.

297
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Jiancheng.

298
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Don't let your brother down.

299
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
You go out.

300
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Go out.

301
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Jiancheng.

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,800
You and I can't go out today.

303
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,400
What's the meaning of last night's morning?

304
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Prince Qi entered the Eastern Palace last night.

305
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
Today, the emperor is out of power.

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Xuanwu Gate is closed.

307
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
There are 300 cavalry officers.

308
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
They are out of town near Xuanwu Gate.

309
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,800
But they left in a moment.

310
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
Who ordered to close Xuanwu Gate?

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Crown Prince's subordinate.

312
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Xuanwu Gate's chief general Chang He.

313
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
Crown Prince controlled the palace?

314
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Tegin.

315
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,600
This was found outside Xuanwu Gate.

316
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
This is the jade sword of Youzhou.

317
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
The horse of Youzhou is Li Jiancheng.

318
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Since Chang He guarded Xuanwu Gate,

319
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,600
why did the crown prince's soldiers

320
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
go outside Xuanwu Gate?

321
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,600
It seems that the king of Qin is not simple.

322
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,000
Chang He is a bad guy.

323
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,800
Mother.

324
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Mother.

325
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Mother.

326
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Mother.

327
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Mother.

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
Mother.

329
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Mother.

330
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
What happened, mother?

331
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,800
Mother, wake up.

332
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Mother.

333
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,800
Mother.

334
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Do you hear me?

335
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Mother.

336
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Wake up.

337
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
Don't scare me.

338
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Don't scare me, mother.

339
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
What happened?

340
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
What happened?

341
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Mother.

342
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Mother, speak.

343
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
Mother.

344
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
Mother.

345
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,600
Mother.

346
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Princess.

347
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Princess.

348
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,000
Princess.

349
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Third Mother.

350
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,000
Princess.

351
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Third Mother.

352
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
What happened?

353
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,800
What happened, Third Mother?

354
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Mother, they...

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,600
Princess, go.

356
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,600
They...

357
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,600
They...

358
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,600
Who are they?

359
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,200
Shi...

360
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Shi Shan.

361
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,600
Shi...

362
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Shi Shan.

363
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,800
Shi...

364
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Princess.

365
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
Chang He, save Third Mother.

366
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Hurry.

367
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,400
And my mother.

368
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
My mother is lying there.

369
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,800
Take her.

370
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Princess.

371
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
Hurry, go.

372
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Princess.

373
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Since Yong Ning was seven or eight years old,

374
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
he has been riding and training with you.

375
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I'm grateful for your gift.

376
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm sure you'll give it to me.

377
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
There's no sound in the city.

378
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Now all four sides are under the King of Qin's control.

379
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
I'm afraid you can't get out.

380
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Princess, hurry.

381
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Princess.

382
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,400
Princess.

383
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Princess.

384
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
The King of Qin is on the horse of the Chang'an City.

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,400
Hurry.

386
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,200
It's hard to break the order.

387
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
Don't blame me.

388
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The Crown Prince has gone.

389
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Princess.

390
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Princess, you must live

391
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
as the old man.

392
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I want to go.

393
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Hurry.

394
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
The past is not like the moonlight

395
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I can't forget

396
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,000
but I look back to the past

397
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Stop.

398
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,200
Stop.

399
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,600
Stop.

400
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,200
Stop.

401
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,400
Stop.

402
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,000
Stop.

403
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Stop.

404
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
Stop.

405
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Stop.

406
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,600
Stop.

407
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
Stop.

408
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,200
Stop.

409
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Stop.

410
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,400
Stop.

411
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Stop.

412
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,400
Fire.

413
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,800
I can't forget

414
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
but I look back to the past

415
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Brother.

416
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
After the emergency,

417
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
spread the news

418
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
in the suburbs of the army.

419
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Especially

420
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
the army that is about to escape.

421
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
The news is that

422
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,400
the Crown Prince and Prince Qi are dead.

423
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
The Crown Prince and Prince Qi are dead.

424
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
They are trapped in the Qi Tribe.

425
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
In the Northern Shang Army,

426
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
they are both saved by the Crown Prince and Prince Qi.

427
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
After the news spreads,

428
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,000
the army in the Tang Dynasty will be in danger.

429
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
In this way,

430
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Great Khan will be at ease.

431
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
I'll go now.

432
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Go.

433
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
I'll wait for him to come back.

434
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Impossible.

435
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
Something must be wrong.

436
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,400
I'll go to find A Yan.

437
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Your Highness.

438
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Your Highness.

439
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
I'm afraid I don't have time to see you now.

440
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,600
Mr. Wei.

441
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,400
How is it?

442
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
According to your order,

443
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
I secretly asked the guards of the Qi Mansion

444
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,600
about the news about the Princess.

445
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
The Princess has escaped from the chase for now.

446
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
But she is not aware of her whereabouts.

447
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Changge, be careful.

448
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
If she escapes,

449
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,000
she should be fine now.

450
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,800
I'm afraid...

451
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
I'm afraid she won't be afraid of this.

452
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Keep an eye on her.

453
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
If there is any news,

454
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,600
report to me at any time.

455
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Yes.

456
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
Go now.

457
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
You can't come back

458
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
without my permission.

459
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
I'll go now.

460
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Changge.

461
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Can you

462
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
call me mother again?

463
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Mother.

464
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Mother.

465
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Mother.

466
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Mother.

467
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Mother.

468
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Mother.

469
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Mother.

470
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Mother.

471
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Mother.

472
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Mother.

473
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
I must live on.

475
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
I'm sorry.

477
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
I misheard it again.

478
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Could it be that

479
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
there is a monkey in the building?

480
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Maybe.

481
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I'll go back and check.

482
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
You can go back and check.

483
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Okay, I'm going now.

484
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm going now.

485
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Go.

486
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Go.

487
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Thank you for saving my life.

488
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Young hero, I'm sorry.

489
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
I didn't mean to save you.

490
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I'm afraid you'll get me in trouble.

491
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Young hero.

492
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Do you have nowhere to go

493
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
to hide here?

494
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,280
It is defender.

495
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,200
Neck pangs so much.

496
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:26,160
After arguing about the

497
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
It's easy to smell.

498
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,440
But don't call me.

499
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
It will attract people.

500
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,360
Come on.

501
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,160
Try it.

502
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,160
Try it.

503
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,960
Young hero.

504
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
What's your name?

505
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,920
Are you from Chang'an?

506
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,160
Or are you from outside?

507
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Why are you here?

508
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,440
Young hero.

509
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,800
You don't like chatting?

510
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,160
Where did you learn Kung Fu?

511
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,360
You learn Kung Fu for justice

512
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,720
or to support the martial art world?

513
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,600
If you say one more word,

514
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll cut off your tongue.

515
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
Young hero.

516
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
I'll ask one last word.

517
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Just one word.

518
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,560
You've been here.

519
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I guess you don't know much about Kung Fu.

520
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
How about

521
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,160
you learn Kung Fu this well?

522
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,160
How about we go

523
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
to the burial place of the Eastern Palace?

524
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
There must be

525
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,760
countless treasures there.

526
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,560
Whose burial place do you mean?

527
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,760
I heard about it.

528
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
It seems to be the wife of the Eastern Palace.

529
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Where is that place?

530
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Where is that place?

531
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
Tell me!

532
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Rongyuan Temple.

533
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Young hero.

534
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,160
Why are you so nervous?

535
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Young hero.

536
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,160
What's wrong?

537
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I heard that the King of Qin was guarding the temple.

538
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Even a horse officer in his army was rewarded.

539
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,160
We both became the blood sisters.

540
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
We were photographed here.

541
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,960
We watched the dead every day.

542
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,760
Who told us to be blind

543
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,160
and go to the King of Qi's home?

544
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,960
Now it's good

545
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,360
to keep our heads.

546
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Speaking of which,

547
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,760
why hasn't the delivery man come today?

548
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
That's right.

549
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Your Highness.

550
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,560
The gift box of the品香斋 has arrived.

551
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,960
Please receive it.

552
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
The品香斋?

553
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
It's ten o'clock.

554
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I don't know.

555
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Who told you to deliver it?

556
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm only responsible for the duty.

557
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
The guest didn't leave a name card.

558
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
This is the legendary

559
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,160
20 taels of silver dessert.

560
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
It's so delicious.

561
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
It's so delicious.

562
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
It's so delicious.

563
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
It's so delicious.

564
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
It's so delicious.

565
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
It's so delicious.

566
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
It's so delicious.

567
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,760
It's 20 taels of silver dessert.

568
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Your Highness.

569
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,760
Desserts can't be left for long.

570
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
If it's not yours,

571
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
I'll give it to you.

572
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,560
Wait.

573
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,160
This is 20 taels of dessert.

574
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,160
How about we...

575
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,360
Be careful of the old age.

576
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,960
We can't make any more mistakes.

577
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,160
You try one first.

578
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,560
I can really eat it.

579
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,760
Then I'll eat this.

580
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,560
No.

581
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
You eat this.

582
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,160
Wait.

583
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,960
That one.

584
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
It's decided.

585
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
It's so delicious.

586
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It's so delicious.

587
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,160
It's the signature dessert of the品香斋.

588
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
That's right.

589
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
It's so delicious.

590
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
It's so delicious.

591
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
It's the signature dessert of the品香斋.

592
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
It's the signature dessert of the品香斋.

593
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
No.

594
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
It's...

595
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
No.

596
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
That's enough.

597
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
It's delicious.

598
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,960
It's really high-grade wine.

599
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
It's so delicious.

600
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
It's delicious.

601
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
It's delicious.

602
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
It's delicious.

603
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Mother.

604
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
It's really you, mother.

605
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
How can I leave you alone

606
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
in this wilderness?

607
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
I can't cooperate with father.

608
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Mother.

609
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
It's them who are too cruel.

610
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
They are so cruel.

611
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
They are so cruel.

612
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
They are so cruel.

613
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
They are so cruel.

614
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
They are so cruel.

615
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Mother.

616
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,160
You and Changge have no hatred in this life.

617
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Did you already know the result?

618
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
But I would rather

619
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
die in the dark night than die.

620
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
The whole Donggong is locked up.

621
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Grandfather is in the palace pretending to be deaf.

622
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Everything is in vain.

623
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Everything is in vain.

624
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm a murderer.

625
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,160
If mother didn't send Changge abroad,

626
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Changge would have died by now.

627
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,160
How can I live without hatred?

628
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Changge is a person who can't be killed.

629
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
No matter how dangerous

630
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
and difficult it is,

631
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Changge will definitely be the murderer.

632
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
I'm not afraid of death.

633
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
What's the point of being sad?

634
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Now the rumors have spread.

635
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Don't say it's a swear.

636
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Even if His Majesty asks to clarify,

637
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,160
I'm afraid it's just getting darker and darker.

638
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,160
This rumor is really vicious.

639
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Someone must want to take the opportunity to make a scene

640
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
and let Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji's old general

641
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,160
worry about you and disturb the morale of the army.

642
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Your Highness should make a decision as soon as possible.

643
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Your Highness,

644
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,160
the Jin's army is the main force supporting the city in the north.

645
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
We can't move around.

646
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
How about we use the title of reward?

647
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Let the generals attack.

648
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Let the generals separate and deal with them.

649
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
It's not worth it.

650
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
If they are not evil,

651
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
how can they enter the palace?

652
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
If they don't enter the palace,

653
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
they will expose their evil intentions.

654
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
That can only cause a stir

655
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
and ruin our country's economy.

656
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Your Highness, you are too arrogant.

657
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
You are too fast.

658
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
You can't do that.

659
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Your Highness, you should be more gentle.

660
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Let's wait and see.

661
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
Your Highness.

662
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Let's leave it at that.

663
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Commander Hao.

664
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
We were poisoned by the bandits.

665
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Please forgive us.

666
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Who did it?

667
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
An ordinary man.

668
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
He is handsome and handsome.

669
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
He sent us some snacks from the品香氈.

670
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
We saw that he ate something unusual.

671
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Please forgive us.

672
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
What else?

673
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Nothing.

674
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
We are in a coma after eating the snacks.

675
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Commander Hao.

676
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
We have checked the memorial tablet

677
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
and the tribute of the Eastern Palace's wife.

678
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
We haven't found any missing.

679
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Father.

680
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
The poison case in Rongwen Temple

681
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
has shocked you.

682
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
I should die.

683
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,160
This is not an ordinary poison case.

684
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
The Eastern Palace's wife is lying here.

685
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Father, please look.

686
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,160
The guards ate these poisoned snacks.

687
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Besides,

688
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
there is nothing stolen in the temple.

689
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
He dared to kill the emperor's commander.

690
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,160
But he didn't get the message.

691
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
It seems he is an old friend.

692
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
My heart is gradually responding

693
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Gradually waking up

694
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Gradually missing you

695
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Before saying goodbye

696
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm feeling light

697
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,160
I'll remember your figure

698
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,160
And lock it into my dream of longing

699
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Before dawn

700
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Before the years

701
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,160
I miss you constantly

702
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
There is always a moment

703
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:57,160
That burns down the wastelands in my heart

704
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,160
There is always a longing

705
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,160
That unites us

706
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
In our world

707
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
In different worlds

708
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,160
I miss you constantly

709
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Over the years

710
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:27,160
It has become a permanent cocoon

711
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,160
There is always a moment

712
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,160
That burns down the wastelands in my heart

713
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,160
There is always a longing

714
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,160
That unites us

715
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
In our world

716
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,160
In different worlds

717
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,160
I miss you constantly

718
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Over the years

719
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:12,160
It has become a permanent cocoon
