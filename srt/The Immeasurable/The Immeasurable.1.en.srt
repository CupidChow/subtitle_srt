1
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,125
I can't hear that

2
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,792
is your voice? or my own?

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,792
I can't hear.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,833
I can't hear, either.

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,083
I can't hear.

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,542
I can't hear.

7
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,833
I can't hear.

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,458
I can't hear.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
《Inaudible distance》

10
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:30,958
Hello.

11
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:32,958
I'm calf.

12
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,000
Put an ice compress on it
you can recover faster.

13
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,167
Thank you.

14
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,292
Let me help you to bandage it.

15
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,958
Just a slight injury, it will heal soon.

16
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,500
I usually get hurt because of my work.

17
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,292
So I've learned how to deal with it by myself.

18
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,458
Do you work for a debt collection agency?

19
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,708
Maybe.

20
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,167
If I meet you on the street someday

21
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:23,792
Please be merciful.

22
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,708
It must extremely twinge to be beaten by you.

23
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm quite gentle, okay?

24
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,458
Do you like a person like me?

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,333
Well... you're... not bad.

26
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,833
I mean, my ability in emergencies.

27
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,833
OK.

28
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,083
I give you a ride.

29
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:45,958
Hello, Hi

30
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:47,917
Hi

31
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,625
You seem to forget to bring something.

32
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,958
Do you want to date today?

33
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:04,708
Do you drink?

34
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,625
OK.

35
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,625
Bye

36
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,208
Bye

37
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,167
Who is it? You look happy.

38
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,333
Nothing

39
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,708
Director, should we make a Chinese version?

40
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,125
Something like using development
as a pretext for plunder.

41
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,042
- Using development as a pretext for plunder?
- Yes... otherwise, it's all in English.

42
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,000
I think we need a Chinese version, right?

43
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,208
Sounds great.

44
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,375
- Yes.
- Can we…?

45
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,083
Or we can make other colors of the version.

46
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:37,958
Okay, sure.

47
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,083
Vic

48
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,208
Your fish looks lonely.

49
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,958
Don't you know that
some kind of fish can't keep together?

50
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,583
It looks pretty and just like you.

51
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,917
So I bought it.

52
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:32,750
Looks like me?

53
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,250
Like what?

54
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,833
Yeah, right!

55
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,042
Lat's be together.

56
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,458
What kind of restaurant is so mysterious?

57
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,917
Just a gourmet restaurant.

58
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:17,875
Gourmet restaurant.

59
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,708
Auntie.

60
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,958
Hey, here.

61
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,542
Come to help, why are you standing there?

62
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,375
Apron

63
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,958
Apron, put it on.

64
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,625
What can I help?

65
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,833
Help me cut the side dishes.

66
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,708
What to cut?

67
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,792
Dried tofu and kelp
it's the lady behind ordered.

68
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,542
For one serving?

69
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:37,875
For one serving.

70
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,125
How?

71
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,917
You look nice in pink.

72
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:43,833
Very beautiful.

73
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,208
The whole set of clothes looks great.

74
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,833
Go through it by your arm.

75
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,500
- Hurry up.
- Okay

76
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
Collect all the bowls.

77
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,667
Cut it.

78
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,667
Come on! There are no customers.
What should I cut for?

79
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,583
We're going to eat it later.

80
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,833
I sit right here and you sit there

81
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,417
- scoot over a bit...
- Okay

82
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,792
Yeah, if you like him, you must cherish him.

83
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:26,625
I know

84
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,833
Really?

85
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,000
Let me tell you that

86
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,667
this beer is the best for a drink after work.

87
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:31,792
Yup

88
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,542
Yup? This is mine!

89
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,125
I'm afraid you'll lose control when drunk.

90
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,500
Kids can't drink.

91
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,667
It's okay.

92
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,542
Let me tell you that Vic,

93
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,625
except for muscles, everything else is weak.

94
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,833
Tell Auntie, I am adept with
both the pen and the sword.

95
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,792
Adept with both the pen
and the sword? Is he fond of you?

96
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,792
Yes

97
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,333
Really? For example?

98
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,458
How is he fond of?

99
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,375
The sort of engraved in your heart.

100
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,583
You are old-fashioned!

101
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,542
Yeah, right!

102
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,125
I have a gift for you

103
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:03,792
What?

104
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,083
News from this station

105
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,417
The development project of
Dream Paradise Resort

106
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:24,292
The sixth review of environmental differences
starts from today.

107
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,958
Environmental groups lodged protests in
front of the Environmental Protection Agency.

108
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,042
There are sporadic conflicts with
people who support development

109
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,000
Fortunately, the police
control the order immediately.

110
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,625
No one was injured.

111
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,375
The police appeal to
all walks of life to calm down.

112
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,792
And environmental groups emphasize that

113
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:39,333
The government handed over the water source
to the consortium for the development

114
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,292
It seriously violates the
ecological environment.

115
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,125
It should be reviewed.

116
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,458
Another protest is expected on Sunday.

117
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,750
The EPA said that after the review
the EIA committee believes that

118
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,250
There is uncertainty
in the ambiance of this case.

119
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,250
The development unit is requested to contact
the relevant competent authority to clarify

120
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,375
Besides, the ecology in summer
and autumn should be supplemented...

121
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,625
Come on!

122
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:02,958
Play with me

123
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,292
Do you think they are happy?

124
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,958
Why do I think there seems to be this story

125
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,708
in my textbook when I was young.

126
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,750
I am not a fish, how could I know that?

127
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,667
I just know that

128
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,958
Can you distinguish
whether I'm happy or not?

129
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,375
Of course you are

130
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,958
Because you are with me

131
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,250
Do you want to add extra dishes?

132
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:34,958
No need

133
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm full

134
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,333
Full?

135
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,958
My appetite is not as big as yours

136
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,250
- director
- director

137
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,333
Are you at a secret rendezvous?
No wonder I didn't see you today.

138
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,958
We are waiting for you to decide the slogans

139
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,125
and applying for the right of way.

140
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,833
By the way, do you know the news just said

141
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,250
that the development proposal
will be passed soon

142
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:52,958
How could we let them pass
the development?

143
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,333
We must block it

144
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,167
Okay, okay, we talk tonight.

145
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,583
We discuss tonight

146
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,708
Is he your friend?

147
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,292
Hello! Do you want to join us?

148
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,583
He has such a good body. Standing
in the first row with us, it must be imposing.

149
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,833
- Yeah, it must be imposing if he goes together.
- Is he shy?

150
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,042
Guys

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,917
Do you really know
what you are protesting at?

152
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,292
The project of development.

153
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,875
Well, if there is a conflict
it will be dangerous, right?

154
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,375
Let's eat first, we talk about it tonight.

155
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,625
Vic

156
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,917
Vic, Vic

157
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,917
ignore them

158
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,583
Don't go with them

159
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,917
You are about to graduate

160
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,417
You need to think about your future work.

161
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,292
I don't understand

162
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,958
Why are you busy protesting all day?

163
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,625
Do you think you can change the world?

164
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,708
Where do you think you are

165
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,333
ten years later?

166
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,125
I don't even know where is myself tomorrow.

167
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,333
Not to mention that ten years later.

168
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,958
Where do you think you are ten years later?

169
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,958
I will be here

170
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,125
Both of us will be here

171
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,708
What's up, dad?

172
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,292
Do you know how much I invested

173
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,667
in this development project?

174
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,125
Why do you protest with others?

175
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,292
Do you want to let us have to live on air?

176
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,792
I've told you several times

177
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,500
As a student, all you need to do
is studying hard.

178
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,958
Do you know I was raised by my aunt?

179
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,417
So, I just want to deposit more money

180
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,375
and let her not be so exhausted.

181
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,542
So, do you know that a peaceful life

182
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,292
is already a happy life for me?

183
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,583
Anyway, just be obedient to your dad

184
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,792
Don't protest, okay?

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,750
My dad hasn't understood me anymore

186
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,750
Why don't you try to stand by my side?

187
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,875
I can't.

188
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,417
Hey guest, here comes your savory tangyuan

189
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:37,333
Thanks.

190
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,042
What's wrong?
Are you in a bad mood?

191
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,583
Once you get in a bad mood
you want to eat the savory tangyuan.

192
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,250
Yeah.

193
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,583
What's wrong?

194
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,750
Auntie

195
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,917
Am I weird?

196
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:05,958
Weird?

197
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,083
I can't understand what others
are thinking about.

198
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,500
That is not weird

199
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,375
Do you think I am weird?

200
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,833
You are the strangest

201
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,333
You could say that too.

202
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,375
You know that I came here 23 years ago

203
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,958
When the noodle stand opened,

204
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,083
People around here

205
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,125
thought I was weird.

206
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:28,667
But half a year later

207
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,958
Everyone is just like brothers and sisters

208
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,375
Do you like a person like me?

209
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,958
I'll be here.

210
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,958
Both of us will be here.

211
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,875
Hey, yes, boss

212
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,917
Okay, I'll go back on stand by

213
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,125
(Calf, can you answer the phone? Leave the scene quickly. it's dangerous.
I'm worry about you, I don't want you to get hurt)

214
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,958
(Please don't go, Calf, where are you? Call me back!
I really care about you, I don't want you to get hurt)

215
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:41,250
using development
as a pretext for plunder…

216
00:20:41,375 --> 00:21:00,500
Back off! Police…

217
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,125
Back off! Police…

218
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,000
- Back off! Police…
- I can't hear you.

219
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,333
Back off! Police…

220
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
I can't hear you.

221
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,958
- Back off! Police…
- I can't hear you.

222
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,667
Back off! Police…

223
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,667
I can't hear you.

224
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,875
Back off! Police…

225
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,750
I can't hear you.

226
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,042
- Back off! Police…
- I can't hear you.

227
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:46,958
I can't hear that

228
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:50,625
is your voice or my own

229
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,750
Is it still painful?

230
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,708
Maybe one day

231
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,708
I can hear what you say as well.
