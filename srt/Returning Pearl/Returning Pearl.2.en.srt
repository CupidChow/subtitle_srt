1
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:13,836
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:17,349
Greetings, Your Majesty.

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,416
I, Jing Yuan, Director of the Department of Punishments,

4
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:24,308
pay my respects to Your Highness.

5
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,198
You may rise.

6
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:27,391
Thank you, Your Highness.

7
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,038
How is the case progressing?

8
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:31,598
The mastermind has been identified.

9
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,734
It's Nanny Song, the Head of the Laundry Bureau.

10
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,122
Bring her forward.

11
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,289
She's the palace maid who entered the palace with a forged identity.

12
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,015
(Who knows what this identity was used for before?)

13
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,014
(I need to come up with a plausible story fast, or I'm dead.)

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,645
Your Highness, I'll confess.

15
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:57,996
I'll confess everything.

16
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,642
I entered the palace…

17
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,494
Actually...

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,575
Actually, it was for...

19
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:11,580
(You're my only hope now.)

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,953
Lord Jing.

21
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,310
Lord Jing? How could it be Lord Jing?

22
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:21,718
How dare you spout such nonsense before the Empress.

23
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:24,654
(I'm sorry, but you're my lifeline.)

24
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:25,848
Right now,

25
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,322
my hands hurt so much,

26
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:32,590
but my heart

27
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,329
hurts even more.

28
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:43,293
I remember when we first met,

29
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:45,733
it was love at first sight.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,576
I thought you were just a young master from an ordinary family.

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,855
I never imagined our social positions would be so far apart.

32
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,413
But true love knows no rank, only sincerity matters.

33
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:07,973
What is love in this world,

34
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:10,894
that it drives people

35
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:14,054
to risk life and death for it?

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,977
Lord Jing.

37
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:22,826
I went through great lengths to enter the palace

38
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:25,774
just to ask you one question.

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,615
(Now, all I need is a love token.)

40
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,710
(This is it!)

41
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,406
You shall be like a rock,

42
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,214
and I like the reed.

43
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,907
The reed may be bound with silk,

44
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,643
But will the rock...

45
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,797
But will the rock ever waver?

46
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,830
- Let go.   - Jing Yuan!

47
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,237
If you truly have a relationship with this woman...

48
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,374
I have absolutely nothing to do with her.

49
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,430
(Not quite convincing enough.)

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,120
Your Highness, please don't make things difficult for Lord Jing.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,015
It's all my fault.

52
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,359
I am just afraid.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,697
Afraid that after I die, there will be gossip throughout the palace.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,273
I am afraid.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,401
Afraid that they'll accuse Lord Jing of being heartless and unfaithful,

56
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,933
or a murderer who is utterly unforgivable and condemned by everyone.

57
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,520
When I think of this,

58
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:22,792
my heart is in agony.

59
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,454
(I've acted this well. Surely this should be foolproof now, right?)

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,353
That's easy enough.

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,095
You are just devoted to Lord Jing and can't bear to implicate him.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,633
Very well then. I'll grant your wish.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,033
(I made it through!)

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,513
Beat her to death.

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,873
What?

66
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,454
(Wait, this doesn't make sense.)

67
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,293
(What do I do? Who can save me?)

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,112
- Princess Huan Zhu!   - Hold.

69
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,325
Your Highness, I am with Princess Huan Zhu.

70
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:09,510
You wretched slave, what madness are you babbling?

71
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,574
There is no Princess Huan Zhu in the palace.

72
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,533
There is no Princess Huan Zhu?

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,376
This is the realm of "My Fair Princess".

74
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:19,334
How come Princess Huan Zhu doesn't exist?

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,376
(Did I accidentally delete her?)

76
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:24,293
(Xiao Yan Zi, where are you?)

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
- Your Highness.   - Well done with the case.

78
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:34,997
Wrap up matters here quickly.

79
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:37,351
The Emperor's hunt is imminent. You must prepare accordingly.

80
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,791
- Yes.   - The hunt is imminent?

81
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,190
No wonder.

82
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,817
Xiao Yan Zi hasn't entered the palace yet.

83
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,481
Your Highness, Princess Huan Zhu is the Emperor's illegitimate daughter.

84
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:51,198
On the day of the hunt, she will publicly claim His Majesty as her father.

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,577
After that, she'll enter the palace.

86
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,694
She'll become Your Highness' greatest threat.

87
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,694
You're spreading malicious lies.

88
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,070
Take her away.

89
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,336
I'm telling the truth!

90
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:04,870
Wait.

91
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:11,853
Whether what I say is true will be revealed on the day of the hunt.

92
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:14,718
(The Empress is suspicious by nature.)

93
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:17,293
(If I say she's her greatest threat, she will surely spare my life.)

94
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:22,574
(But Xiao Yan Zi, I'm sorry for giving you such a disastrous start.)

95
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,190
Where are we going?

96
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:26,557
Department of Punishment.

97
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,031
No, the Empress has pardoned me. What do you want to do?

98
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:36,613
I warn you, in this palace...

99
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:37,973
How dare you run away!

100
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:39,750
My lord, please forgive me.

101
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,424
Greetings, Lord Jing Yuan.

102
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,006
This palace maid clumsily broke something.

103
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:47,158
I was just teaching her a lesson.

104
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:48,774
That's all the lines she has?

105
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:50,151
Yes, my lord.

106
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,757
- Come.   - No!

107
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,918
Come! Hurry up.

108
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,894
She just broke something. Do you really have to hit her that hard?

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,119
Insolent maid, you'll learn your lesson today.

110
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:04,814
If you offend the princes or the consorts,

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,600
you could be executed 10 times over and it still wouldn't be enough.

112
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,853
A mistake deserves punishment.

113
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:10,510
Follow the rules.

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,753
Yes, my lord.

115
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,376
Breaking hunting equipment is to be punished with 10 strokes.

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,713
Oh no.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,033
She'll die.

118
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,654
You are lowly palace maids.

119
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:31,533
Once you enter this palace, you must know your place.

120
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:35,990
Stop.

121
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
10 strokes have been administered.

122
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:40,840
Lord Jing, that was only three...

123
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:44,053
Yes, my lord.

124
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:53,493
Since you wanted to save her, why make her suffer those three strokes?

125
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:56,950
Within these palace walls, the rules are supreme.

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,920
A mistake must be punished. It is only right and proper.

127
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,200
Rules?

128
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:01,774
Are rules more important than human life?

129
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,814
How can you be so cold-blooded?

130
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:07,574
Do you see that vat in the distance?

131
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,480
Last year, a noblewoman tried to defend a palace maid who made a mistake.

132
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
In the end, both of them were drowned in the vat.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,936
If you want to survive in the palace,

134
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:15,831
you should watch your mouth.

135
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:20,711
He's right.

136
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:23,053
I have to keep my mouth shut.

137
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,253
I have only 66 lines left.

138
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:31,973
(Once the lines run out, the character will die.)

139
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:35,294
How many lines does he have?

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,800
Why don't you have a number?

141
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:44,990
What number?

142
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,722
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

143
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:52,282
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

144
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,216
(The number hasn't changed.)

145
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:58,278
Talking to him doesn't reduce the number.

146
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:00,133
(He must be my destined match!)

147
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:02,191
Walk.

148
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,343
(Department of Punishment)

149
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:20,549
My lord.

150
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:22,973
You can have a private conversation here with Ms. Lin.

151
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:24,653
I will stand guard for you.

152
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:30,831
It's all your fault for talking nonsense outside and ruining my reputation.

153
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:33,431
Reputation?

154
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:35,934
Does that mean...

155
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,197
- You're still a virgin?   - You...

156
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,174
So this love line is chaste on both sides?

157
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:43,437
I like it.

158
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,630
How audacious!

159
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,577
Let's talk things out.

160
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,073
Don't reach for that whip.

161
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,856
I read the stars at night.

162
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:53,311
You and I share a destined bond from past lives. There's no escaping it.

163
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:56,013
If you don't believe me, I can prove it to you.

164
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,773
How will you prove it?

165
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,610
Do you remember my prediction today?

166
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:00,691
On the day of the hunt,

167
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,796
Princess Huan Zhu will claim the Emperor as her father.

168
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:06,174
If that truly happens, wouldn't that be the best proof?

169
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,517
What are you really plotting?

170
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:16,294
These props are really heavy.

171
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
So scary.

172
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,150
So eerie.

173
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:24,253
Sure enough, the Department of Punishments is true to its name.

174
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,957
Look at all this stuff.

175
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,177
The Department of Punishment is a serious place. No fooling around.

176
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,393
Speak.

177
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:37,694
Well...

178
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,280
I just want to make a bet with you.

179
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:44,893
What do you want to bet with me?

180
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:01,238
- How dare you!   - I'll bet on this.

181
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:05,071
If Princess Huan Zhu really shows up, I win,

182
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,334
and this jade pendant will be mine.

183
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:10,434
If you lose,

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,256
I'll make sure you die without a grave.

185
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:18,630
Deal.

186
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:48,718
My male lead.

187
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,073
Got you wrapped around my finger.

188
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,493
(The hunting grounds are huge.)

189
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,574
(Where will Xiao Yan Zi even be?)

190
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:26,677
(Jing Yuan, keep a close eye on Lin.)

191
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:30,294
(If she makes any suspicious moves, take care of her for me.)

192
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
You were told to burn incense to repel insects,

193
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:40,518
but instead you've been standing there in a daze, looking around.

194
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,733
Jing Yuan, thanks for handling security today.

195
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,557
Fifth Prince.

196
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,753
Lord Fu.

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,096
Jing Yuan, we grew up together.

198
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,437
You've ignored countless noble ladies,

199
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:57,013
yet you brought a palace maid to the hunting grounds today.

200
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,477
Er Kang and I are very curious.

201
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,395
It's just official business. Nothing else.

202
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:02,790
Still slacking off?

203
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:05,591
Get to work!

204
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,977
How cruel.

205
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,390
She's just a maid who doesn't know the rules.

206
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:15,454
Slack off again and I'll throw you in the woods for the wolves!

207
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,951
Get to work!

208
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:24,260
(I need to find a way to escape or I'll miss the key plot.)

209
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,030
Why are you still standing here?

210
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,263
Get to work!

211
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,399
What Er Kang meant was that you're cruel and heartless toward us.

212
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,520
Because you took the best bow in the entire hunting ground.

213
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,214
A slacking maid?

214
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
I don't see any of it.

215
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,514
Hyah!

216
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:40,878
Hyah!

217
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:46,733
Looks like I can only use you to save myself.

218
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,193
Still slacking! I'll beat you to death!

219
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:52,591
It hurts.

220
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:57,457
This is...

221
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,493
This is Lord Jing's jade pendant.

222
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,126
He never parts with it.

223
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:02,390
Could it be that

224
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:05,454
the rumors about you and Lord Jing

225
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,334
are actually true?

226
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:09,094
What do you think, Eunuch?

227
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,373
Ms. Lin Er, you must be tired.

228
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,553
Get up quickly.

229
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,297
Go and rest in the shade. I'll take care of the work.

230
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:23,054
Ms. Lin Er, please walk slowly.

231
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:24,721
Watch your step.

232
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,874
Princess Huan Zhu, here I come.
