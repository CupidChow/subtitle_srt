1
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:13,840
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,124
Assassin!

3
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,188
She's not the real princess!

4
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:23,565
- Here it comes, the iconic scene of "My Fair Princess"!   - Stop her!

5
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:24,909
- What are you doing?   - Zi Wei!

6
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,742
Yes! It's Zi Wei!

7
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:29,653
Er Kang, there seems to be some disturbance at the rear.

8
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,000
Go check it out.

9
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:33,032
I'll hold things here. This could be a diversion.

10
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:34,113
Alright.

11
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:36,893
Let go of me!

12
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:40,764
Xiao Yan Zi, if you're the princess, then who am I?

13
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,655
Who am I?

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,713
Beat her up!

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,216
Your Majesty...

16
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,015
Your Majesty...

17
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,922
Your Majesty...

18
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,269
Your Majesty...

19
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,508
Er Kang! Er Kang, turn around!

20
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:21,829
That's Zi Wei! Your Zi Wei!

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,958
Turn around and look at her!

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,455
Your Majesty!

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,302
Stop! Stop it!

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,028
She's just a defenseless girl.

25
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,684
Won't you at least hear her out?

26
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,484
Is this any way to treat someone?

27
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,656
Looks like you're in this together.

28
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,914
Keep hitting her!

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,793
Come on!

30
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,308
Let go of me! Go away!

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
Why did you act so recklessly?

32
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:18,342
My lord...

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,056
Are you alright?

34
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:02,524
(Key plot point achieved. New character unlocked.)

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,553
You're awake.

36
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:22,425
Where is that girl?

37
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,045
Where is she?

38
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,342
Have some water first.

39
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,264
That girl has been taken away by Lord Fu.

40
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,073
You, on the other hand,

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,697
you risked your life to save her.

42
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:37,623
What is your connection to her?

43
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,673
She...

44
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,124
She's my childhood friend.

45
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,165
Childhood friend?

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,153
After all these years apart,

47
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:49,700
how can you be so sure?

48
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,884
While that girl may seem vulnerable,

49
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,179
how could you be sure she wasn't working with others?

50
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,136
Causing a commotion here as a distraction,

51
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,353
while her accomplices tried to attack the princess?

52
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,753
No, she wouldn't.

53
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:03,161
I trust her.

54
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,616
She's still the same Zi Wei I knew.

55
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,924
Gentle on the outside,

56
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,285
but brave at heart.

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,273
Seeing her again,

58
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,785
she's even braver than before.

59
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:20,782
You look

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,457
different today.

61
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:30,964
What was I like before?

62
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,655
You were selfish.

63
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,230
Always lying.

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,096
You also look different today.

65
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:43,435
How so?

66
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,975
I never thought the Living King of Hell from the Department of Punishments

67
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,751
had a heart for playing the hero.

68
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,302
Thank you, Lord Jing.

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,473
You're welcome.

70
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,762
Lin Er, come here!

71
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,965
Is it true you saved a girl from the common folk today?

72
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,725
That wasn't me, it was Lord Fu who saved her.

73
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,295
Tell me, what did she look like?

74
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,760
She's as lovely as a painting,

75
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:21,251
but she's braver than she looks.

76
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:22,887
Oh, right,

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,337
she told me

78
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,364
her name was Zi Wei.

79
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,461
It really is Zi Wei!

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,953
She's actually...

81
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:34,008
I can't tell you!

82
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,789
Lin Er, since she's staying with Lord Fu now,

83
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:41,324
how can I meet her?

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,233
Xiao Yan Zi,

85
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,148
if she can't come into the palace,

86
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,617
you can go out to see her.

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,577
But leaving the palace isn't easy.

88
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,429
Come on, you're Xiao Yan Zi!

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,639
With your skills,

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,989
hopping over a wall or two should be a piece of cake!

91
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,284
That's true!

92
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,640
(The Art of War)

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,856
What is this thing called love...

94
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:27,444
That it makes one pledge life itself?

95
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:45,634
You're writing

96
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:47,828
my name?

97
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:49,645
But what does it mean?

98
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:52,684
Year after year of safety.

99
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:54,919
Year after year of safety?

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,256
They're simplified characters.

101
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,713
Simplified characters?

102
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,873
Anyway,

103
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,940
you really do need to practice your handwriting.

104
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,645
Your writing and the Princess's are

105
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:07,833
equally atrocious.

106
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:09,959
What do you know?

107
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,199
This is a To-sign.

108
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,759
Do you have any idea how many people want

109
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,559
an exclusive signature from a big star like me?

110
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,439
- Talking nonsense again.   - You have the nerve to call it ugly!

111
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,993
Forget it. I'm not writing anymore. I'm not giving it to you.

112
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:20,268
Alright, alright.

113
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,566
If your writing's bad, then practice more.

114
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
Hard work makes up for lack of talent.

115
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,810
Tell me what you want to write.

116
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,382
I'll teach you.

117
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:35,118
I want to write...

118
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,505
What is this thing called love...

119
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,417
Got him flustered, didn't I?

120
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,208
What's wrong?

121
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:53,232
Lord Jing, don't tell me you don't know this poem?

122
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,553
That's not difficult.

123
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,097
Tell me the strokes of your simplified characters.

124
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:26,451
I will write them for you.

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,313
The first stroke

126
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,457
is a dot.

127
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:14,461
Focus.

128
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,765
It's so stuffy in here.

129
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:35,885
I need some fresh air.

130
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,480
(What is this thing called love, that it makes one pledge life itself?)

131
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,999
Xiao Yan Zi just left.

132
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,794
I need to keep an eye on that Living King of Hell.

133
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,452
Can't let him ruin the crucial reunion between the sisters.

134
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,109
Weird.

135
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:24,903
Why is nobody here?

136
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,482
Oh no. Has our plan been exposed?

137
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,586
Sneaking into my room in the dead of night,

138
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,160
what are you plotting?

139
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,165
What could I possibly be plotting?

140
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:48,432
How can a woman like you behave so shamelessly?

141
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,599
I need to buy Xiao Yan Zi more time.

142
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,204
What's a big man like you so shy about?

143
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Let me have one look, it's not like you'll suffer any losses.

144
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,235
Just one look!

145
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:00,101
Let go. Let go!

146
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,136
How is this robe so easy to tear?

147
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,508
Well, the plot is progressing very conveniently.

148
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,857
I like it.

149
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:11,319
Don't go too far!

150
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,376
Her Majesty has arrived!

151
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,913
I'm doomed.
