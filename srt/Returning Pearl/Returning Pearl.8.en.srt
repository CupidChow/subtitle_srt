Candlelight dinner prepared by my lady

9
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:00,078
You are lucky, kid

10
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,440
But this time has already arrived

11
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,751
Why doesn't Jing Yuan come here?

12
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,647
Really naughty

13
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,744

00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,872

in my time

19
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:37,478
twenty years old

20
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,693
This is a passionate age

21
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:42,272
Not afraid of difficulties

22
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,337
Dare to pursue your dreams

23
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,137
No question in the end

24
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:46,671
Just ask sincerely

25
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,059
But you are in this deep palace

26
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,237
go through suffering

27
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,009
Seal the heart and lock the love

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,062
I really feel unworthy for you

29
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,528
What nonsense is this girl talking about?

30
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:00,994
no

31
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,565
I can't be sarcastic

32
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,353
I really feel sorry for your life experience

33
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:08,553
After all, isn't this all my fault?

34
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:09,219
No, no, no

35
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:10,044
what to do

36
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,759
But don't be afraid

37
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,734
I will always be by your side

38
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:19,431
because

39
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,447
You are my hero

40
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:23,944
your ending

41
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,989
I can only write it

42
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes

43
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,608
that's all

44
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:30,490
That's right

00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:47,269
I'm here

47
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:48,762
You all, please stand down.

48
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:52,175
yes

49
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,528
The human heart is dangerous and the road is weak.

50
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:14,172
The breeze blows and the atmosphere is just right

51
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:22,093
Wei Jing Wei Yi Yun Zhi Jue Zhong

52
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,509
A birthday gift prepared by myself

53
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:27,904
The iceberg will definitely melt tonight

54
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:30,028
Taoism is the only one

55
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,844
Taoism is the only one

56
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:40,984
How can I say it?

57
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:43,175
Is this my punishment?

58
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,372
Why do you do this to me?

59
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,918
System, please come out

60
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:13,244
Didn’t I already know I was wrong?

61
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,931
Why can't you give me a chance?

62
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,721
It's all your fault

63
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:03,038
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

64
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,103
It's all your fault

65
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,447
sorry

66
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:17,706
I'm late

67
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:39,065
Happy birthday to you

68
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,528
Happy birthday to you

69
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,406
I wish you happiness and health

70
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:47,997
have

71
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,322
have

72
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:55,081
Make a wish

73
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,084
blow out candles

74
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:58,525
Make a wish

75
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:00,862
you close your eyes

76
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,367
grant a wish

77
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,234
tell yourself

78
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,739
Then

79
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:08,744
blow out the candle

80
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,237
good

81
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,087
Have you thought about your wish?

82
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:27,440
Think about it

83
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:30,216
Blow out the candles

84
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,531
i today

85
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,277
I was originally at Wangchunting

86
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:45,383
I have prepared a candlelight dinner for you

87
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,122
I also made you a birthday cake with my own hands

88
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,400
But this rain

89
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:52,663
I tell you

90
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:54,223
This is my first time making a birthday cake

91
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,131
do you know

92
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:57,287
my first time making cake

93
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:58,540
This is my first time doing it myself... I know it all

94
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,125
you know

95
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,525
You lit many candles in Wangchunting

96
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:07,944
Fortunately, there was no water leakage

97
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:09,828
Otherwise we'll get into trouble again

98
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:13,483
But what you did

99
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,879
It's all in my heart

100
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,402
It's all in your heart

101
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:32,665
that

102
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:34,288
real

103
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:36,453
What you just sang

104
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,062
Happy birthday

105
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:39,865
Very nice

106
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:43,869
very

107
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:44,740
OK

108
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,398
You actually remember

109
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,023
That's a good idea

110
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:51,759
clever

111
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,638
very good

112
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:55,872
very good

113
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,582
this song

114
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,969
So nice

115
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,290
Is it just spread among the people?

116
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:04,512
Why haven't I heard of it?

117
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:07,156
This is called happy birthday song

118
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,812
Everyone has to sing it on their birthday

119
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,862
Chaoyang District, Beijing

120
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:18,397
my home

121
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,294
That's a floor-to-ceiling window in my house

122
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,622
Ohira layer

123
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,544
And my fluffy sofa

124
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,194
Although I don't understand

125
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:33,383
But I can feel that you miss home

126
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,206
If you are homesick, why do you come to the palace?

127
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,161
poor family

128
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:40,615
Nonsense

129
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,557
I became famous at a young age

130
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,209
I started doing commercials when I was twelve years old

131
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:45,387
I've been popular

132
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,274
Hacked

133
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:47,575
but i

134
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,962
Just never been poor

135
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,987
Shooting ads is

136
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,325
It's just a playbook for others to read.

137
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:58,683
you don't know

138
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,484
I'm in my hometown

139
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,990
So popular

140
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,647
I have played the role of a female general

141
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,178
chef

142
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:10,972
I also played a fairy

143
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,650
So what is this about?

144
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:14,447
What kind of stories are they?

145
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:16,512
They are all love stories

146
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,419
Not that it is

147
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,082
female general

148
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,500
The cook and the fairy?

149
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,112
yes

150
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:24,344
general

151
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,934
Then fall in love with the enemy

152
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,762
Nanako

153
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,865
Naturally, he falls in love with the diners

154
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,928
That fairy?

155
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,122
Fall in love with a fairy

156
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,353
but

157
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:40,915
This act goes on and on

158
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,053
It's all a routine

159
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:43,492
boring

160
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:44,337
boring

161
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,023
Since this is boring

162
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:49,375
Why are you acting?

163
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,439
You're asking for trouble

164
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,197
because of acting

165
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:02,756
It's my dream

166
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,019
when i was little

167
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:08,344
every summer

168
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,184
everyone will get together

169
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:12,823
watch a play

170
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:16,675
this story

171
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,837
It's about a pair of sworn sisters

172
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,306
elder sister

173
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,275
She is a real princess living among the people

174
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:27,734
My sister is a wandering little gangster

175
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:31,219
They are each other's best friends

176
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:33,475
Support all the way

177
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:35,522
rely on each other

178
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,490
this is me

179
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:41,986
unattainable

180
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,231
I thought at that time

181
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,769
if possible

182
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,693
I want to hide behind the character

183
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:56,700
to become all kinds of people

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,769
Experience thousands of lives

185
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:10,678
What about yourself?

186
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,961
what kind of person are you

187
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:20,847
I

188
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:24,934
I have no idea

189
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:32,175
Then when you grow up

190
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,834
Is this drama still happening?

191
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:37,837
Act

192
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,872
Acting

193
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:42,834
been acting

194
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:44,053
good

195
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,097
hope future

196
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,622
One day I can see your play

197
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:55,143
What's wrong

198
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:56,256
