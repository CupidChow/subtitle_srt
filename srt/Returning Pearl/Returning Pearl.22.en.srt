1
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:14,875
superior

2
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:15,600
One of you is the emperor’s favorite brother

3
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:19,237
One is the most valued minister of the emperor

4
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,164
for so called love

5
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,418
For two folk women

6
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,224
To sacrifice everything

7
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,747
Is it really worth it?

8
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,143
For the little swallow

9
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:42,987
I can give up my identity as elder brother

10
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:44,221
for me

11
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,484
Nothing in this world is as precious as crape myrtle

12
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,550
But what if this world is all fake?

13
00:02:58,775 --> 00:02:59,843
manly man

14
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:02,027
Act with a clear conscience

15
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,749
No matter what happens in this world

16
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:04,774
Just a dream

17
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,103
I also have to listen to my heart

18
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,439
You have been bullied in the palace since childhood

19
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,306
My fifth elder brother and I came to help

20
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:13,675
Nothing else to do

21
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:15,690
Just follow your heart

22
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:19,327
Just from the heart

23
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:21,231
So what I'm doing right now

24
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,797
After all, he accepted the fate of fooling people.

25
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,443
Still listened to my heart

26
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:33,915
I

27
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,875
On your little face first

28
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:38,187
hot flower

29
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,624
if

30
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,471
You still refuse to sign

31
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:44,443
I'll take your meat

32
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,437
piece by piece

33
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,602
Blanched

34
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:49,459
Lin'er

35
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:52,788
don't want

36
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:53,256
Lin'er

37
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:54,027
don't want

38
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:54,603
open

39
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:56,025
Don't want Lin'er

40
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:56,984
Help

41
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:08,465
Hurry up and get out of here

42
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:09,268
crape myrtle

43
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,009
little swallow

44
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,812
Is Ziwei okay?

45
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,681
Why did you come?

46
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:16,588
If you don't come again

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,306
That dog officer used a soldering iron

48
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,295
Branded us into pieces.

49
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:25,067
The emperor didn't even convict them.

50
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,493
How dare you abuse lynching

51
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:30,200
You are so brave

52
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:31,306
Adult Kei

53
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,925
You know best

54
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,815
If there is no punishment

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,987
Where does the truth come from?

56
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,097
The lower official is also of the same mind

57
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:37,671
I want to find out the truth

58
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,600
Do you want the truth?

59
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,784
Still have to give in and make a move

60
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,186
Lord Jing and Xiaguan

61
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:44,862
Under the orders of the Queen and the Empress

62
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,765
Investigate the case thoroughly

63
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,765
Could it be that Mr. Jing wants to do this for Lin'er?

64
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,881
Betrayal of the Queen

65
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,115
Let's go first

66
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:06,931
Come to Lin'er

67
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:11,662
oh

68
00:05:58,814 --> 00:05:59,414
Liu Hong

69
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,837
Little Swallow Crape Myrtle

70
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,188
What's wrong with you guys?

71
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,543
Don’t ask Liu Hong yet.

72
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:05,223
This is Liu Qing, Liu Hong

73
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,042
They are all my good friends who have passed away.

74
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,489
The courtyard is relatively hidden

75
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:09,943
Let's take shelter here

76
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:10,490
good

77
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:11,588
Come on, come on, let's go in first

78
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:12,481
Let’s talk after we go in

79
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:13,425
quick

80
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,087
Liu Hong

81
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,262
These are our good sisters in the palace

82
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:25,465
Called Lin'er

83
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,356
Why are you so cruel?

84
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:36,748
Lin'er

85
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:37,809
You have to be patient

86
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,700
You'll get better quickly if you take medicine

87
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,025
Lin'er

88
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,480
If you are in pain

89
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:57,737
Just shout it out loud

90
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:02,502
Not that exaggerated

91
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:03,947
Sister Liu Hong

92
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:05,522
You can come

93
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,029
good girl

94
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:20,893
Lin'er Lin'er

95
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:22,765
Lin'er

96
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,625
Lin'er was injured the most

97
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,627
They blocked us a lot of whips at that time

98
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:33,647
fine

99
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:34,962
crape myrtle

100
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:35,975
It's fine

101
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:37,159
Lin'er

102
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,228
If you are in pain

103
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:40,428
Just hold on to me

104
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:41,503
Hold on to me

105
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,018
Um

106
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:44,481
Lin'er

107
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,222
Bear with me any longer

108
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,162
good

109
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:54,508
Lin'er

110
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,108
It's fine

111
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:01,588
I'm fine

112
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,653
I'm really going to starve to death

113
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:17,193
Okay, okay, come right away

114
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:18,493
Liu Qing went to get it

115
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:19,484
Where is it?

116
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,999
Liu Qing

117
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,267
Let me see

118
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:39,355
It will hurt a little

119
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,225
Hold on a little longer

120
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,065
Come

121
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,068
Hurry up and have something to eat

122
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:02,024
Don't worry, everyone

123
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:03,603
It's absolutely safe here

124
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:04,540
No one will come

125
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:07,878
Let's all settle down here to avoid the limelight.

126
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:11,002
eat slowly

127
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:12,087
I'm starving

128
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:12,965
well

129
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,218
Eat slowly and don't choke.

130
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,231
My mother always says

131
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:21,125
The king's heart is unpredictable

132
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:23,872
I didn't understand before

133
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,387
now i understand

134
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,260
My heart hurts so much

135
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:35,337
Not just us

136
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:37,662
Even your concubine was implicated

137
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,333
Slow down, no one will compete with you

138
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,171
Are you choking?

139
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:03,615
What's wrong, everyone?

140
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,678
Then he is the emperor

141
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,662
Aren’t all the emperors in the world like this?

142
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,095
Investigate other people’s affairs to the end

143
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,678
about one's own affairs

144
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:15,131
Then you won't blame yourself

145
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:16,559
right?

146
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,153
I finally understand

147
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,950
Huang Ama doesn’t care about us at all

148
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:23,323
He is happy

149
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:24,303
Like ten

150
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:25,412
Nine likes and eight likes

151
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:26,825
He is unhappy

152
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,068
Kick us away

153
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:29,556
Regardless of our life or death

154
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,210
Anyway, this ruined palace

155
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,084
I can't stay any longer

156
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,131
Xiao Yanzi is right

157
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,081
Although there is glory and wealth in the palace,

158
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,731
But it’s not as good as a large courtyard

159
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,068
At least here

160
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,209
We all live a solid life

161
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:41,968
Um

162
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:43,256
Not a little swallow

163
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,350
One code to one code

164
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:47,112
I will definitely go back when I go back

165
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,650
That Ziwei is Princess?

166
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,881
She must return to her original position.

167
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:52,387
After this experience

168
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,387
I figured it out too

169
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:55,653
Identity can be taken away at any time

170
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,353
But real feelings don't

171
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,946
I'm just like a little swallow

172
00:10:58,988 --> 00:10:59,953
I won't go back either

173
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:00,419
no no no

174
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:00,883
good

175
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:01,990
Little Swallow Crape Myrtle

176
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,484
Don't be anxious, both of you.

177
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,368
Can you give the emperor some time?

178
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:06,522
Give him some time

179
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:07,775
He naturally figured it out

180
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,282
He is your emperor, Lin'er

181
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:09,956
Lin'er

182
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:12,706
Look how injured you are

183
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,628
Why do you keep urging us to go back to the palace?

184
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:15,705
Yes, Lin'er

185
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,437
Jingyuan is for you

186
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:18,900
Carrying the felony of prison robbery

187
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:20,582
Why would you want to go back?

188
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:22,687
I

189
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,853
every year

190
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,459
It doesn't work out every time

191
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:31,245
Do you still want to keep hiding it?

192
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,046
what do you mean

193
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,878
What is Lin'er hiding?

194
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,012
No matter what I hide over the years

195
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,178
i believe

196
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,247
She must have her own reasons

197
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:51,578
Um

198
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:57,123
They are now

199
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:58,859
They all treat you as a true friend

200
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:00,414
if you really care about them

201
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:01,384
Just tell the truth

202
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:03,571
Stop treating everyone like pawns, okay?

203
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,374
It's okay, Lin'er

204
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,375
Did you encounter any difficulties?

205
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,040
If you encounter any problems

206
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:16,109
Just tell us

207
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,452
Let's all figure it out together

208
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,557
Let's help you solve it together

209
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,639
Xiao Yanzi is right

210
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,000
You see we have so many friends together

211
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,159
I'm sure you can think of a way to solve the problem.

212
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,372
Um

213
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,109
Little Swallow Crape Myrtle

214
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:33,568
They are so good

215
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,828
Live so vividly and bravely

216
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,668
It’s not that I don’t have any thoughts at all

217
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,159
Paper person without emotions

218
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:45,137
Lin'er

219
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:45,981
All right

220
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,040
Will you really believe me?

221
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:56,035
Um

222
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,222
Um

223
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,218
Um

224
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:01,847
good

225
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:04,331
I said

226
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:08,794
actually

227
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,706
In fact, I am not from this world

228
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:24,831
this world

229
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,967
Not real either

230
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:50,824
Wow

231
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,381
Turns out I'm so powerful

232
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,637
I am the protagonist in the storybook

233
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:57,721
yes yes yes

234
00:13:57,948 --> 00:13:58,900
You are the most powerful

235
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:00,311
you are the protagonist

236
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,015
but

237
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,265
i never thought about it

238
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,934
Our world is actually fake

239
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,440
And it’s a storybook

240
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:08,300
What happened?

241
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:11,762
As long as we all live happily

242
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,296
We are all happy

243
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,009
Yes or no

244
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:16,756
what i feel is real

245
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,975
This world is real

246
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:20,659
you're right

247
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:30,993
Zhuang Shengxiao dreams of butterflies

248
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,530
I don’t know it’s Zhuang Zhou Mengdie

249
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,555
Still Butterfly Dream Zhuang Zhou

250
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,472
The world outside this story

251
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:37,097
Maybe it's another storybook

252
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,466
No matter whether this world is true or false

253
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:45,100
crape myrtle

254
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,571
my heart for you

255
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,571
is alive

256
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:48,625
sincerely

257
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,409
I can meet you and know each other and fall in love with you

258
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,415
for me

259
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,187
It's the best world

260
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,027
Xiao Yanzi is right

261
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,803
No matter whether this world is a storybook or not

262
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,218
We all need the company of the world of mortals

263
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:17,243
Live a carefree and unrestrained life

264
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:18,804
Makes sense

265
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:27,881
sorry

266
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:30,662
I've been hiding this from everyone for so long

267
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:34,853
little swallow

268
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,709
crape myrtle

269
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:42,340
I don't seem to know when it started

270
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,115
I've truly blended in with you.

271
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:53,490
you

272
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,629
They are all my best best friends

273
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:12,147
Okay, my good Lin'er

274
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:13,321
It's okay

275
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,787
oops

276
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,796
My good Lin'er

277
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,493
It's okay

278
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,056
Um

279
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,137
Then how do you return to your world?

280
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:34,959
crape myrtle

281
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,707
Actually I want to ask you a question

282
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,500
Do you really not remember the golden lock?

283
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:39,868
golden lock

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,477
That big golden lock you gave me

285
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:43,228
no

286
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,365
she is a person

287
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,107
She's your personal maid

288
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:47,507
I grew up with you since childhood

289
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,627
Then I will accompany you to Beijing to recognize your father.

290
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:51,893
You really don’t remember her?

291
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:53,124
I

292
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,271
I don't remember such a person at all.

293
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,318
impossible

294
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,193
Ziwei was alone when she came to Beijing

295
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:04,343
What's around her

296
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:05,812
gold lock silver lock

297
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:07,112
Nothing

298
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:08,693
Lin'er, did you remember it wrong?

299
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:11,500
Ziwei can't remember the existence of Jinsuo

300
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,003
It further shows that there is something wrong with the golden lock
