1
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,922
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,145
How does it taste?

3
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,681
You cook well, Lord Jing.

4
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:23,681
You seasoned the filling well.

5
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:26,137
Of course.

6
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:29,120
This is my mother's secret recipe.

7
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:34,400
Since I was ten years old,

8
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,521
I started acting and doing commercials.

9
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,360
From one unit to another

10
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:41,840
and acting from one role to another.

11
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:43,840
Real

12
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:46,000
and stable things

13
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:47,881
are few in my life.

14
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,041
So, when I was sad,

15
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,521
I'd make myself a bowl of wantons.

16
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,041
When I have this familiar taste,

17
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,760
my hear won't feel as empty.

18
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:01,785
That's good.

19
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,760
I no longer remember

20
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,920
the taste of my mother's cooking.

21
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,785
Sorry.

22
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,401
If I knew, I would've changed your back story

23
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,640
instead of making you suffer in such loneliness.

24
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:20,544
Sui Sui.

25
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,800
Were you lonely

26
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:25,305
in your world?

27
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,103
(Episode 28)

28
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,161
My parents

29
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,401
passed away one after another

30
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:38,548
a few years ago.

31
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,881
The environment I lived in

32
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:42,561
was a place of fame and fortune.

33
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:46,080
There were too many temptations, deceptions,

34
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,680
and far too many conflicts of interest.

35
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,080
I could only wear a mask

36
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,080
and put on a facade

37
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:57,441
to prevent myself from getting harmed.

38
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,281
I've always felt

39
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:01,001
that it's not true.

40
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,080
However, in this fairytale world,

41
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,920
I felt all of your sincerity

42
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,401
and loyalty.

43
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,424
Jing Yuan,

44
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:14,721
do you know?

45
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:16,640
No one has given me

46
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,200
warmth and love like you.

47
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,185
Me too.

48
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:29,640
I don't know

49
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,161
which world is real.

50
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:38,704
Sui Sui.

51
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,401
Although I don't understand your world,

52
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,178
I remember

53
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,561
how my mother insisted on choosing

54
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:50,425
to be with the person she loved

55
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,520
despite her family's objection.

56
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,001
They didn't spend the rest of their lives together

57
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,185
but I believe

58
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:59,225
she must be very happy

59
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,561
when she was in love with my father.

60
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:04,800
So, it's also the same

61
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:06,905
to me.

62
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:11,000
You exist.

63
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:15,401
Our love also exists.

64
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,024
Am I right, Sui Sui?

65
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,208
Yes.

66
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,418
So, I think

67
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:26,401
when your people created this story,

68
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:28,920
they were also trying to teach people

69
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,680
how to make a choice

70
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,480
between authority and true love.

71
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:37,704
You are right.

72
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:40,721
The story of "My Fair Princess"

73
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:42,761
was popular around the world back then.

74
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,800
Many people were touched by this story

75
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,880
because it talked about how precious

76
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:50,457
true love was.

77
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,800
Her Majesty used to tell me

78
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,721
that my mother was wrong.

79
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,401
After hearing that for a long time, I thought the same, too.

80
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,641
However, I felt a little unwilling to accept it.

81
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,183
You celebrated my birthday a few days ago

82
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,680
and asked me to make a wish.

83
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,761
Although you said a wish shouldn't be revealed to others,

84
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,360
I still want to tell you my wish.

85
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:16,680
The wish I made was

86
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,320
hoping that my birth wasn't a mistake.

87
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,865
Thank you.

88
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,201
My wish has come true.

89
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,618
Jing Yuan, sorry.

90
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:40,800
You will soon

91
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,560
return to your world.

92
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,618
No matter what,

93
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:46,738
I want to tell you

94
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:49,961
that you must pursue the most sincere love

95
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:53,273
regardless of your environment.

96
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:57,161
All right.

97
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,480
When I leave,

98
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,081
what do you plan to do?

99
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,920
I am

100
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:22,440
the director of the Department of Punishments.

101
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,281
I am someone with power and authority.

102
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,912
I will live a lavish life.

103
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,440
Perhaps I will get married and have children.

104
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,200
I'll be blessed with many descendants.

105
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:35,937
I don't need you to miss me.

106
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,281
But you are my male lead.

107
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:40,880
Besides me,

108
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:43,961
you won't have another romantic storyline.

109
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:45,298
That's even better.

110
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:48,120
I will focus on building my career.

111
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,240
The ambitions of a good man lie everywhere.

112
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,761
You must trust me.

113
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:56,560
I won't be tied down forever

114
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:58,680
by love.

115
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,708
Life is full of partings, reunions, joys, and sorrows.

116
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,602
It's something no one has ever been able to escape.

117
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,105
I'll think of you

118
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,401
as going to a faraway place.

119
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,601
When I miss you,

120
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,120
I will eat a bowl of wantons.

121
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,480
Perhaps you will also

122
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,920
be eating the same thing in that world

123
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,641
when you miss me.

124
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:39,978
Jing Yuan,

125
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,000
from now on,

126
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,000
no matter how far we are apart,

127
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,641
I will never forget you.

128
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:55,425
Sure.

129
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,721
By Heaven's will and the Emperor's decree,

130
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,704
Zi Wei is the emperor's biological daughter.

131
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,120
She was lost since she was young

132
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:21,480
and has finally been reunited.

133
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,064
It's the blessing of Heaven.

134
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,225
His Majesty will grant Zi Wei the title of Princess Ming Zhu

135
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,705
to prove her identity.

136
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:29,345
The commoner, Xiao Yan Zi,

137
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,465
will maintain her title of Princess Huan Zhu.

138
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,825
Both princesses will live in Shufang Hall

139
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,305
and enjoy His Majesty's grace.

140
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,161
End of decree.

141
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,641
Thank you, Your Majesty.

142
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:41,241
Congratulations, Your Highnesses.

143
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:43,785
I'll be leaving.

144
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:46,920
Zi Wei.

145
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,186
- This is great.   - Is this true?

146
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,424
I... I am still Princess Huan Zhu.

147
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,521
You are Princess Ming Zhu.

148
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:57,041
Lin Er, did you know this already?

149
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:59,720
Zi Wei is Princess Ming Zhu and I am still Princess Huan Zhu.

150
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:01,200
Heaven's secret cannot be revealed.

151
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,958
I'm so happy!

152
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:07,920
Tonight, we'll have a barbecue party at Shufang Hall!

153
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,097
Great!

154
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,667
Xiao Zhuo Zi, Xiao Deng Zi, Ming Yue, and Cai Xia.

155
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:13,306
Go and get prepared.

156
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,560
Prepare more meat.

157
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,041
All right. I'll go right away.

158
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:18,720
(The story of "My Fair Princess" has been completed.)

159
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,200
(Lin will return to the real world at the hour of Zi three days later.)

160
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:29,344
Sui Sui.

161
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,121
Three days later.

162
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:34,600
At the hour of Zi.

163
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:38,161
Three days later.

164
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:41,778
At the hour of Zi.

165
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:43,960
Three days later?

166
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:48,401
Three days later.

167
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:49,704
Lin Er.

168
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,545
- At the hour of Zi.   - Lin Er.

169
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:54,785
What's wrong?

170
00:09:57,704 --> 00:09:59,281
Three days later, at the hour of Zi,

171
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,080
I will be leaving.

172
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:05,320
Three days later?

173
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:08,041
- Yes.   - Why must you leave so soon?

174
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:11,784
No. I'm reluctant to see you go, Lin Er.

175
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:13,761
Me too, Xiao Yan Zi.

176
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,881
I don't want you to leave.

177
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,504
- Zi Wei.   - Lin Er.

178
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:22,840
I will miss all of you.

179
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,041
Everyone actually...

180
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,624
I will miss all of you.

181
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:27,840
Doesn't need to be too worried.

182
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,600
Lin Er isn't leaving.

183
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,224
She's just going home.

184
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,680
She should return to her own world.

185
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:37,945
Right?

186
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,041
Isn't this a good thing?

187
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,800
All of us should feel happy.

188
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,138
Jing Yuan is right.

189
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:47,881
There's a time

190
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:49,305
for gathering and separating.

191
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,467
It has been this way since ancient times.

192
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,544
We shouldn't be upset about this.

193
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,001
Don't we still have three days?

194
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,945
Let's think of something fun to give Lin Er as a farewell.

195
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,337
That's right. Xiao Yan Zi, think of something.

196
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,440
Is there anything fun and delicious?

197
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,500
All right.

198
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,105
We will drink and eat to our heart's content.

199
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,920
We must send Lin Er home happily.

200
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,025
Don't cry.

201
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,144
- All right.   - Promise me, all right?

202
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,264
Don't cry, okay?

203
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:25,344
Don't cry.

204
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,281
- Okay.   - Okay.

205
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,305
All right.

206
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:37,384
Don't be sad and don't cry.

207
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,464
All right.

208
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,422
- Jing Yuan.   - Yes?

209
00:11:58,305 --> 00:11:59,840
I have a gift for you.

210
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,385
What gift?

211
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,789
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

212
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:14,898
I hope

213
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:16,504
your life

214
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:17,945
will be smooth forever.

215
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,185
All right.

216
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:09,857
Yong Qi,

217
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,424
you can even draw?

218
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:12,825
Make me look prettier in your painting.

219
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:14,680
I want to look as pretty as Lin Er and Zi Wei.

220
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,792
Fifth Prince learns from Giuseppe Castiglione.

221
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:18,960
He draws like a master painter.

222
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:20,145
Look at this composition.

223
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:22,080
Jing Yuan might not be here

224
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,080
but Fifth Prince drew all of us in here.

225
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,378
Yes. I planned this for a long time.

226
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,212
Jing Yuan is busy working but he mustn't be left out.

227
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:30,704
When I finish this painting,

228
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:32,440
it'll be hung at Shufang Hall.

229
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:34,200
Even if she isn't around,

230
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,361
she will still be with everyone.

231
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:40,960
I, Lin Sui Sui, am unworthy

232
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,600
of this miraculous encounter

233
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,080
to be friends with all of you

234
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:47,840
and live a carefree life.

235
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:52,600
I will never forget all of you.
