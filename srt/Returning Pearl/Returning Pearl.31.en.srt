1
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,922
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:21,206
(Lin, it's the hour of Zi. Leave immediately.)

3
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,525
(Otherwise, you'll also vanish forever.)

4
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,925
What is love in this world...

5
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,006
That it drives souls to devote themselves to life and death?

6
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,485
(Am I dead?)

7
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,765
(Perhaps Heaven pities me)

8
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,606
(and let me have a sweet dream.)

9
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,566
(You saw the wishlist that day)

10
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,445
(and said this was your greatest wish.)

11
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,270
(Jing Yuan,)

12
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,965
(I want to fulfill your wish tonight.)

13
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,845
I'm still alive?

14
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,910
How?

15
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,246
Was it a dream?

16
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:40,645
Why did it feel so real?

17
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,525
Lord Jing, did you have another sweet dream?

18
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,765
Did you have another sweet dream?

19
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,470
Sui Sui.

20
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,510
You didn't leave.

21
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,703
I'm not leaving.

22
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,645
I'm going to stay

23
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,806
and accompany you forever.

24
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:38,549
I'm afraid

25
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,046
you'd regret it one day.

26
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,085
Then, just give me lots of love

27
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,566
so I won't regret it forever.

28
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,030
All right?

29
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,645
I promise.

30
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:44,250
