1
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:15,207
Go down

2
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,623
Resign from humble position

3
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:21,905
Very good

4
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,270
Princess Seiya falls in love with Yuan'er

5
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:25,566
Yes, empress

6
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,070
This is a great joy

7
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:29,725
The emperor attaches great importance to toast

8
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,375
If he could marry the chieftain's daughter

9
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,764
That can be regarded as the glory of my Ulanara family.

10
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,178
Yuan'er finally got through it

11
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,314
yes

12
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:40,276
The queen wants to get involved

13
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,501
If you don't take action, it will be over

14
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,510
you

15
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:11,345
stop

16
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,924
The slave meets Princess Seiya

17
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:17,084
you

18
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:19,389
Did I see you next to Jing Yuan yesterday?

19
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,001
Princess Seiya has a good memory

20
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,532
I am a maid in the queen's palace

21
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,657
I'm very familiar with Mr. Jing.

22
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:27,120
That's good

23
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:28,284
my warrior

24
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:29,603
Let me wait until he finishes his official duties

25
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:30,884
Come with me to visit the capital again

26
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:32,844
I can't wait

27
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:34,145
You take me to find him

28
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,245
Princess Seiya comes with me

29
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:40,541
Princess Seiya, please come here

30
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,404
Even on the verge of death, you still speak harshly.

31
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:58,720
Say it quickly

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,832
Let you see the cruel side of Mr. Jing

33
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,177
It would be weird if you were still interested in him

34
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:09,532
who

35
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:15,273
Meet the princess

36
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:17,485
My warriors don’t need to be polite

37
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,365
Why did you bring the princess to the Sentence Division?

38
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:24,805
It's bloody and dirty here

39
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:25,964
In case you disturb the princess...

40
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,684
Mr. Jing doesn’t blame her

41
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,645
I asked her to bring me here

42
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:31,965
I'm not afraid

43
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,124
Strict judiciary

44
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,884
The country can be strong

45
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:37,645
Me too

46
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,684
I got to appreciate a different side of the Qing Dynasty

47
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,094
It’s rare for a princess to come to the capital

48
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,351
Please don’t stay here in Xiaguan

49
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,376
delay time

50
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:48,750
yes

51
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,843
I'm just here to invite Mr. Jing

52
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:51,925
Accompany me to visit the capital

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,041
this…

54
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,066
Let's go, let's go

55
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:06,245
princess you

56
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:07,856
Be careful

57
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:08,685
be careful

58
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,740
Sugar-coated haws

59
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:11,629
what is that

60
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:12,857
This is

61
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:14,742
Our unique candied haws in Central Plains

62
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:16,662
Children's food

63
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:18,026
So beautiful

64
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:19,339
I have never seen it on the plateau

65
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:20,320
Is it tasty

66
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,048
You try it

67
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:26,841
Um

68
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:29,125
Sweet and delicious

69
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,454
Are you afraid that I won’t be enough to eat?

70
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,688
Did you buy two skewers specially?

71
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,005
It's so kind of you

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,761
I specially left the biggest one for you.

73
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,668
Kei Oto Kei Oto

74
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,490
What's wrong with Mr. Jing?

75
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,244
Are you okay?

76
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:59,013
Adult Kei

77
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:00,995
Adult Kei

78
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,724
If you feel unwell

79
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,015
Let's go back to the palace first

80
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,886
I just left the palace and I have to go back.

81
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:09,710
I'm fine

82
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:11,445
Don't spoil the princess's mood

83
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:12,924
Let's continue shopping

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,729
good

85
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:14,678
Lin'er

86
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:17,382
Came just in time

87
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:18,401
Fuku adult

88
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:19,804
We are shopping

89
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:20,910
What a coincidence

90
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,513
I will come back with my mother-in-law to offer incense.

91
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,420
Just happened to see you

92
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,454
We are traveling to the capital with Princess Seiya

93
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,241
Together?

94
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:28,949
When you visit the capital, you should look for me.

95
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,312
princess seia

96
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:32,445
The streets and alleys of this capital city

97
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:33,681
I grew up playing

98
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:36,164
Walking with birds and playing with crickets

99
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,497
Listen to a play and watch shadow puppets

100
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,448
Eat roast duck and make the donkey roll around

101
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:40,834
You’ll be entertained for three days and three nights

102
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:41,700
I don’t even want to go back to the palace

103
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:42,606
Really

104
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:43,251
Um

105
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,262
Then how about we go together?

106
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:47,716
this

107
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,085
Mr. Fu came at the right time

108
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:51,670
The official is feeling unwell

109
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,735
Afraid of spoiling the princess’s mood

110
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,386
Why don't you ask Mr. Fu?

111
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,454
Let's go shopping with the princess

112
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,740
Let's go Princess Seiya

113
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,924
Take a look, take a look, take a look

114
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,844
you look happy

115
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:29,945
Let's all do it together

116
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,554
Green peppers Roasted green peppers

117
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:32,924
Look

118
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:33,685
Who did I bring?

119
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,945
princess seia

120
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,206
You came just in time

121
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:37,577
We are having a barbecue

122
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,423
Are you tired after a day of walking around the capital?

123
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,091
Sit down, sit down

124
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:40,938
Please take a seat

125
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,442
Listen to Ertai

126
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,935
Princess Huanzhu is the pistachio of the Qing emperor

127
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,679
Always come up with fun ideas

128
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,891
I'm not the only one with pistachios

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,126
And Lin'er

130
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:56,488
Lin'er, you should sit down too

131
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,645
Lin'er just taught us a word

132
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:01,770
called barbecue ladder

133
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:03,565
Ladder?

134
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:04,457
alright

135
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:06,204
Now that everyone is here

136
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:08,084
Then let's get started

137
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:08,510
good

138
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:09,066
good

139
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,541
Why doesn’t Mr. Jing come?

140
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:11,884
He hasn't rested yet, okay?

141
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:12,923
Good luck to the fifth elder brother

142
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:13,916
Good luck to Princess Princess

143
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:14,876
Good luck to you, Mr. Fu

144
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,860
Good luck to Princess Seya

145
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:16,463
Okay, okay

146
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,573
Good luck, good luck, get up soon

147
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:18,535
Xie Gege

148
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,038
Mr. Jing is still handling official duties at the Shenxing Department

149
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:22,870
I specially asked the little one to bring good wine and food.

150
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:24,523
Princess Seiya please taste it first

151
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,303
Wait for Mr. Jing to finish handling his official duties.

152
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,079
Then personally apologize to Princess Seiya

153
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,382
Okay okay

154
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,491
This princess has long been hungry and tired

155
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:32,576
Don't wait for Mr. Jing

156
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,005
Let's eat first

157
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,301
Wait until Master Jing comes

158
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,401
I have to punish him by drinking three glasses of wine

159
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:38,091
no problem

160
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:39,057
Small resignation

161
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,145
Then it starts

162
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:41,666
cheers

163
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,270
Cheers Cheers Cheers

164
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,404
We sing what Lin'er taught us

165
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:49,001
when

166
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:53,866
Let us live a life of ease in the world of mortals

167
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:57,524
Riding horses galloping to share the prosperity of the world

168
00:07:57,525 --> 00:08:01,043
Sing to the wine and express the joy in your heart

169
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:06,429
Seize the youth with vigor and vitality

170
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,982
Sing to the wine and express the joy in your heart

171
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,979
What's wrong with Lin'er?

172
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:13,638
fine

173
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:15,776
- I just burned my eyelids - Princess Seiya, please let me do it.

174
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:16,998
Don't hurt yourself, right?

175
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,005
This is a slave's job

176
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,160
How do you know the slaves of Shufangzhai?

177
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,464
They all climbed onto the master’s head

178
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,207
Sing happily with the master

179
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:26,225
This princess has no choice but to do it herself

180
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:27,798
What to say

181
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,700
We don’t have anything in Shufangzhai

182
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,210
Master, slave, etc.

183
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,476
we are all family

184
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,023
Just like when we were in the courtyard

185
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,205
It is said that the Qing Dynasty was a country of etiquette.

186
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,085
He doesn't even distinguish between superiority and inferiority

187
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:42,698
fifth elder brother

188
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,248
Am I wrong?

189
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,485
Everyone drank some wine today

190
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:47,723
Discourteous

191
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:48,867
I hope the princess will calm down

192
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:51,205
Lin'er is not a slave

193
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,571
she is my good friend

194
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,205
my good friend

195
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,136
Not only can we eat and drink together

196
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,561
Can we live and die together?

197
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:59,410
What princess?

198
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:00,085
Don't even understand

199
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:00,882
what did you say

200
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:01,405
little swallow

201
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:02,244
I just don’t understand anything

202
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,869
You just said you don’t understand anything

203
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,901
Little Swallow is fine, fine

204
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:06,348
Delicious barbecue is here

205
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:07,573
Okay, okay

206
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,045
Very fragrant

207
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:14,535
how did you bake it

208
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,604
This is my secret recipe

209
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:18,637
The princess is still angry

210
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,039
I won't tell you

211
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,622
If you dare not tell me

212
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:24,451
I'll tie you back to the plateau

213
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,724
Go barbecue for me

214
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:32,490
alright

215
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:34,434
sit

216
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,203
Let's eat

217
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:49,593
How is your riding skill?

218
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,181
It's no problem to win you

219
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:53,465
boast

220
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,565
Let’s compete another day

221
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,085
Always with you

222
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,728
good

223
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,025
Give

224
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:29,965
This pair has been matched up, right?

225
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:31,903
Done

226
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:36,297
Princess Seiya asked Ertai to be the consort

227
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,197
Jingyuan

228
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:39,543
You ruined a good chess game for me

229
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:41,753
I know my mistake

230
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,753
It turns out you are such an obedient child

231
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,085
who is

232
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,644
Make you obsessed

233
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:50,244
I will never forgive you

234
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,524
Wei Chen has been growing up

235
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:54,550
Follow the queen's arrangements in everything

236
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:58,445
But love is the only thing that can’t be forced.

237
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,712
No matter how hard I try,

238
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:02,844
princess seia

239
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,644
She will only follow her inner choice

240
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,325
You are so fooled by me

241
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,412
When did you win Seiya's heart?

242
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:15,564
Those are the only things you have in mind right now

243
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,822
worthless love love

244
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:19,684
empress

245
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,135
empress

246
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:22,965
Not good

247
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,685
The emperor wants to make Ziwei his concubine

248
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:35,664
Madam, please don’t panic

249
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,756
The slave dares to mention it

250
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:40,428
us

251
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,205
We have one last move

252
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,285
Go get Ziwei’s uncles and aunts

253
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:01,724
Take it to the Imperial Study Room

254
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,829
yes

255
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:04,831
Walk

256
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,250
Let's go and see the excitement too

257
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,932
Farewell to the Queen Congratulations to the Queen

258
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,203
emperor

259
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,375
This slave only has admiration for you

260
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,497
A slave cannot be a concubine

261
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,244
Thoughts of admiration

262
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,405
You make tea for me every day

263
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,558
Play the piano and write poems for me

264
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:29,593
Could it be

265
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:32,640
Just think of me as your father

266
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:35,431
Emperor Ama

267
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,175
Ziwei cannot be your concubine

268
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:38,484
Emperor Ama

269
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:41,505
Emperor Ama

270
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,084
Ziwei cannot be your concubine

271
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:45,364
little swallow

272
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,671
I have decided

273
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,689
There's no room for you to talk here

274
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:50,631
Emperor Ama

275
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,056
Ziwei is my sister

276
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,865
She can't be your concubine

277
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,164
I want to protect her

278
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:55,681
you

279
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,925
The Queen has arrived

280
00:12:58,466 --> 00:12:59,226
emperor

281
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,965
Ziwei cannot be a concubine
