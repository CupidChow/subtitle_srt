1
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,066
Our top priority is to find the golden lock

2
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,957
Only in this way can Lin Er smooth out the plot.

3
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,487
to go back

4
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:27,352
no problem

5
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:29,256
The more we all have, the more strength we have

6
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,507
Let's find it now

7
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,115
But the crowd is huge

8
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:33,524
Where to find it?

9
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,405
Lin'er

10
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:43,026
You should know the most about golden locks

11
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:43,852
Um

12
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,075
So in your opinion

13
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,055
Where should we go first?

14
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:54,802
Golden lock and crape myrtle

15
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,226
They are inseparable sisters

16
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:57,934
Logically speaking

17
00:01:58,514 --> 00:01:59,674
Where is Ziwei?

18
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:01,212
Where will she be with the golden lock?

19
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:04,766
Traveling all the way to Beijing to find my father

20
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,111
Take a big risk

21
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:07,949
is it possible

22
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,927
I didn't take her to Beijing

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,200
He left her in his hometown in Jinan

24
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:14,329
Um

25
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:15,908
Ziwei, do you remember?

26
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:18,146
When you first arrived at the courtyard,

27
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:19,023
one person

28
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,615
Still feeling sick

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,661
no one around

30
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,527
If they are really good sisters

31
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,112
I'm sure I won't leave it alone.

32
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:25,788
Um

33
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,172
Too

34
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:26,655
Um

35
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:27,758
Then it seems we must

36
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,152
I went to Jinan City to see it.

37
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:30,723
See if there are any clues

38
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,233
Go! Go! Go

39
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:35,697
After we left the palace

40
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:37,555
It's dangerous to stay here too

41
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:38,980
It's better to go to other places

42
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,083
In this case

43
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:42,490
I can find the golden lock girl again

44
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:43,752
We can hang out together again

45
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:45,746
You just know how to play

46
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,690
Help Lin'er find clues first

47
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:49,036
It's important to let her go home

48
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,849
You can go and have some fun later

49
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,196
good

50
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,968
thank you

51
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,520
I tell all your stories

52
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,784
It's a mess

53
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,330
You still help me like this

54
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:19,743
Jingyuan

55
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:20,733
I'm fine

56
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,418
I just want you to come back

57
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:25,004
A place that truly belongs to you

58
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,177
Back to Beijing

59
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:32,358
Return to Chaoyang District

60
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:08,186
Emperor Ama

61
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,140
Emperor Ama’s auspiciousness

62
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:11,254
You have finished approving the memorial

63
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:11,799
Um

64
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:12,545
How about it

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,149
Is your waist sore or your back hurts?

66
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:14,796
emperor

67
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,268
Why

68
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,652
I made chrysanthemum tea for you

69
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,130
Best for clearing the liver and improving eyesight

70
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,490
Little Swallow is the best

71
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:34,324
you say

72
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,912
Little Swallow is the best

73
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:37,605
you say

74
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:38,855
You say it

75
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,465
Little Swallow is the best

76
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,318
Say it

77
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,615
Little Swallow is the best

78
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,727
Emperor Ama

79
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:49,262
Emperor Ama’s auspiciousness

80
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,452
Sit down, sit down

81
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:52,863
Got a new gadget

82
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:53,412
Um

83
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,330
You have finished approving the memorial

84
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:55,985
Um

85
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,890
Is the back sore?

86
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:57,677
Does backache hurt?

87
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:58,949
Are your eyes tired?

88
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,083
I use my swallow fist

89
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:01,908
Give you a beating

90
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:02,714
good

91
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,492
How is the strength?

92
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,516
just right

93
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,130
emperor

94
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:10,516
Um

95
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,740
I made chrysanthemum tea for you

96
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:12,125
oh

97
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,549
Best for clearing the liver and improving eyesight

98
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:14,430
You try it

99
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,055
Um

100
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,190
Miaki Kiyomi

101
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:24,974
All in tea

102
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:25,749
Um

103
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,132
The emperor is busy with everything

104
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,790
Be sure to remember to take care of your dragon body

105
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:30,208
Don't overwork yourself

106
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,083
oops

107
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,280
You two

108
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:36,124
One is my Jieyuhua

109
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,493
One is pistachio

110
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:40,718
pistachio

111
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:43,462
As long as I come to Shufangzhai

112
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,455
There are no worries anymore

113
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,820
Come and beat me over there

114
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,542
what's this name

115
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:54,732
little liar

116
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,101
little liar

117
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:56,705
Um

118
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,848
Isn't that you?

119
00:05:57,873 --> 00:05:59,554
I'm not a little liar

120
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:16,312
Hana Hana

121
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,323
pistachio

122
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:20,637
What they brought to me

123
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:23,790
Is it really the crime of deceiving the emperor?

124
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,880
Of course it is the crime of deceiving the emperor

125
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:29,596
Queen

126
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,458
What did you just say

127
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:33,972
The emperor is kind

128
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,846
Only then will he be deceived by the traitor

129
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:38,836
Those two girls are full of lies

130
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:40,443
Bad motives

131
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,152
Just greedy for glory

132
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,455
Have you ever had the slightest respect or love for the Emperor?

133
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,371
Okay, okay

134
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:47,371
matter

135
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:48,802
I want to go and try it myself

136
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,955
I'm afraid it's too late

137
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:52,987
two days ago

138
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:56,156
They had already kidnapped Jing Yuan and escaped from the palace.

139
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,489
What

140
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,374
Why hasn't anyone started talking about this matter?

141
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,320
I don’t want the emperor to be hit again

142
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,637
People have been dispatched throughout the city to hunt him down

143
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,771
The concubine dared to remind the emperor

144
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:09,724
Your favorite fifth elder brother

145
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,148
The promising Falcon

146
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,246
He actually kidnapped my concubine’s adopted son

147
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,637
With an unidentified princess

148
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:15,662
Escaped from the palace

149
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,532
Such rebellious behavior

150
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:18,183
emperor

151
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:21,858
implore the emperor

152
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,430
Don't be fooled by their sweet words anymore

153
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,699
How unreasonable

154
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,637
This is an act of rebellion

155
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:29,627
Rebellion against Tiangang

156
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,190
In vain

157
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,587
Still thinking about old feelings

158
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:38,540
good

159
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,012
Since they want to put the law to the test

160
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:42,621
That me

161
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,741
Just let them have a taste

162
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,289
What it feels like to be wanted

163
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,333
If they are found

164
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,902
If I carry out lynching, it will be exposed.

165
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:09,424
Don't stop doing one thing and two things

166
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,440
More experts are sent to search the city

167
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:13,415
Once discovered

168
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:15,333
Just in the name of resisting arrest

169
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,368
correct employment law

170
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,793
empress

171
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:19,345
Lord Jing, he

172
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:24,049
He knows everyone under me

173
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,143
If he is still stubborn

174
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,899
Just think that I have raised him for nothing

175
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,143
Have you seen this person?

176
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:40,668
Come down and walk

177
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,993
Let me see

178
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,783
etc.

179
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,936
What's going on over there?

180
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,087
Let's go

181
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:49,533
Come here first

182
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
What is this?

183
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,496
Go over there

184
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:08,055
Isn't it me who's in the portrait?

185
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,124
And me

186
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:15,741
Now even the fifth elder brother and Erkang

187
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:16,607
All are wanted

188
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,511
Huang Ama really doesn’t leave us a way to survive.

189
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:19,746
It is not advisable to stay here for a long time

190
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,206
We have to find a way out of town

191
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,296
Um

192
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:22,940
Why

193
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:23,549
it's them

194
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:24,087
Too bad

195
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,239
Go, go, go

196
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:25,815
Walk

197
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:26,715
stop

198
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:27,977
Don't run

199
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:30,274
Don't run

200
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:44,777
Erkang

201
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:46,318
crape myrtle

202
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,287
Erkang

203
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:49,342
crape myrtle

204
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,383
Erkang

205
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:53,633
crape myrtle

206
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,071
This way

207
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:58,749
stop

208
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:00,162
stop

209
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,757
Search and come here

210
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:14,899
Let's go

211
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:18,437
Gone

212
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:27,946
Walk

213
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:30,715
crape myrtle

214
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:31,474
Jingyuan

215
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:32,999
Lin'er

216
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,172
I found wanted posters along the way

217
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:37,487
There is no Jingyuan in the portrait

218
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,330
Not as good as this

219
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:39,202
Jing Yuan and I

220
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:41,465
We went together to Jinan to look for golden locks

221
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:43,408
You go back to the courtyard first to avoid the limelight.

222
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,033
This reduces the risk

223
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,118
Jinan

224
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:46,838
Can

225
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:47,790
But Jinan is so big

226
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,087
How did you find the golden lock?

227
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,290
That's not a big problem

228
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,605
The Criminal Investigation Department has a lot of experience in investigating cases and searching for people.

229
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:54,243
OK

230
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,769
I think this plan is feasible

231
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,617
Our top priority now is to save lives

232
00:10:57,842 --> 00:10:59,058
Little Swallow and Willow Green and Willow Red

233
00:10:59,083 --> 00:10:59,803
They are all old Jianghu

234
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,349
They can help us hide

235
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,287
crape myrtle

236
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,387
Since Lin'er said we are the protagonist group

237
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,590
So only we are safe

238
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:06,935
Only then can she have no worries

239
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,274
Go all out to find the golden lock

240
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:09,330
Um

241
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:12,271
good

242
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:12,975
Lin'er

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,760
Then you and Jing Yuan

244
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,863
We must go to Jinan safely and find the Golden Lock

245
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,137
I'll wait for you to come back

246
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:17,949
Take care of yourself

247
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:21,721
Take care of yourself

248
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:22,308
good

249
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,712
every year

250
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:25,421
Without further ado

251
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,400
good

252
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,149
Walk

253
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,427
Walk

254
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,164
stop

255
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:32,890
come over

256
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:34,837
Although we are not wanted

257
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,777
But there is no way out of the city

258
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,808
stop

259
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:54,980
parking

260
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,176
The people in the car came down to check

261
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:07,619
Officer, this is my daughter

262
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:23,982
Let's go

263
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:24,647
The city gate is about to close

264
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:25,883
Yes yes yes yes

265
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:26,687
release

266
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:46,743
Everyone should have a rest early.

267
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:48,502
I have to leave early tomorrow

268
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,587
Already out of town

269
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:52,769
You two, come down

270
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,162
Who are you?

271
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:03,786
not me

272
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:04,318
father

273
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:05,901
they are my friends

274
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:07,655
Uncle us

275
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,679
I am a maid from a wealthy family

276
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:13,869
We are in love with our young master

277
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:16,581
But my mistress wouldn’t let me

278
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,185
So Master

279
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:22,074
Then take me away from the capital

280
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,318
Return to hometown in Jinan

281
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:27,293
Why don’t you have a Jinan accent?

282
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:28,537
oh

283
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:29,640
when she was five

284
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,025
So he was sold to our house by Yapo.

285
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:32,283
Um

286
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:33,865
What

287
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:35,353
father

288
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,099
We happened to pass by Jinan

289
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:38,790
Just help them.

290
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:39,840
What help?

291
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:42,983
benefactor

292
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,483
Please make it easier for you

293
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:46,461
help us

294
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:47,137
Um

295
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,746
That’s all

296
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,927
Would rather demolish ten temples

297
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,789
Never ruin a family relationship

298
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,805
Let's hit the road together tomorrow

299
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:56,727
thank you

300
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,540
thank you

301
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,402
go to bed early

302
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:03,383
thank you

303
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,408
saved us

304
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:05,299
Little benefactor

305
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:06,372
May I have your name

306
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:07,805
My name is Xiaohongzao

307
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,469
Do you like eating red dates?

308
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:10,734
So is it called Little Red Date?

309
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:11,740
Um

310
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,440
Give me all your osmanthus candies

311
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:15,917
I’ll give you my red dates to eat

312
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,302
Thank you very much

313
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Are you optimistic?

314
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:31,006
That's how it works

315
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,037
You try

316
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:36,694
I'm chasing you

317
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,408
We'll reach Jinan in three days' walk.

318
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:47,109
Thank you so much for your care along the way.

319
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,118
You're welcome

320
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,452
You guys took care of little red dates for me all the way

321
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,314
Her mother left early

322
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,374
I took her everywhere to beg for food.

323
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:58,823
She can't even make any friends

324
00:14:58,848 --> 00:14:59,633
Look

325
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,212
She hasn't been this happy for a long time

326
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,368
small red dates

327
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:07,155
father

328
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:09,199
Let sister take a rest

329
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,527
I'll take you to the street to buy delicious food

330
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:12,971
elder sister

331
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,315
I'll bring you something delicious when I come back

332
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,930
good

333
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,230
Slow down

334
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:17,471
Walk

335
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:22,965
Don't get too involved

336
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:25,243
you forgot

337
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,068
We are all characters in your storybook

338
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,336
You really treat Xiaohongzao as your friend

339
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:31,861
Little Yanzi said

340
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,130
As long as this feeling is real

341
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,490
Then this world is real

342
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,896
Xiao Hongzao is my friend

343
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:49,671
Is it sweet?

344
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,368
Um

345
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:51,040
sweet

346
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:52,412
Jingyuan

347
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:55,490
I believe this is the real world

348
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:03,262
so sweet
