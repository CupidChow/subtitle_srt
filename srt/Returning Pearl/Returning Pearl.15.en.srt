1
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:18,619
little swallow

2
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,922
Look what I bought you

3
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:22,959
Yongqi

4
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,591
I really can’t live without Little Swallow even for a moment.

5
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:31,484
Lin'er

6
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,481
What's wrong

7
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:33,747
you have something on your mind

8
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:35,291
Looks good, this is good

9
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,456
Then let's buy it

10
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:37,693
boss

11
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:38,443
How much does this cost?

12
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:40,925
Is our trip coming to an end soon?

13
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:41,709
Um

14
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:42,859
according to plan

15
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:44,116
The return flight was completed at a later date.

16
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,446
at a later date

17
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,003
According to the plot

18
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,184
Soon the emperor will be assassinated

19
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:52,895
Ziwei knife blocker

20
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,169
How could I bear to see Ziwei get hurt?

21
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,469
Lin'er

22
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,331
Why is Ziwei injured?

23
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:06,322
I have to think of a way

24
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:07,826
Turn this big thing into a trivial matter

25
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:08,791
avoid serious injury

26
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:09,482
Um

27
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:10,623
Seriously injured?

28
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,879
do you have gold

29
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:17,644
Kaneko

30
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:18,593
have

31
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:21,090
Isn't it not good?

32
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,772
This is a bag of gold leaves

33
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:25,528
This is my golden jade ring

34
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:29,347
This is a wad of banknotes

35
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:35,453
Returning to the capital this time

36
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:38,353
I will give you all my wealth

37
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,533
Just buy whatever you want, okay?

38
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,834
Unexpectedly, Mr. Jing from the Shenxing Division

39
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,359
So kind to my wife

40
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,381
Then the people in the palace found out

41
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:52,016
Aren’t they all shocked?

42
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:53,480
That's natural

43
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,417
from now on

44
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:01,355
my whole person

45
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:03,412
whole heart

46
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:05,644
It'll all be yours

47
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,719
Girl, the gold weapon you want to strike is ready.

48
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,531
Are you satisfied with it?

49
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:40,838
With this big golden lock

50
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,522
If Ziwei blocks the knife, you will suffer less

51
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,291
Moreover

52
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,130
This is a golden lock

53
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,402
I have made up for it in this plot.

54
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,512
missing character

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,800
This is for Ziwei

56
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:58,709
given to me

57
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,184
Such a big golden lock

58
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,150
No, Lin'er

59
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,647
This is too expensive

60
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:03,731
I can't accept it

61
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,781
Nothing valuable or not

62
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,022
Come to Ziwei

63
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,047
Put it on for you

64
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,441
You gave her all the money you had

65
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,319
good looking good looking

66
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,387
She put such a big lock on others

67
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:17,887
Isn't she doing this also for Ziwei?

68
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,344
This further proves that she is not a money-grubbing person

69
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:21,725
Moreover

70
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,356
This is Lin'er's affection

71
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,403
So what if I help her

72
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,388
Come on

73
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:29,667
crape myrtle

74
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,294
I'll count on my fingers

75
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:32,775
You are short of gold in your life

76
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,433
If you take it with you, it will surely keep you safe

77
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:36,869
you promise me

78
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,171
Never take it off

79
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,086
Thank you Lin'er

80
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:48,327
eat eat

81
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:49,744
Come

82
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:50,899
crape myrtle

83
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:51,931
This is pork liver

84
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,219
Blood-enhancing and beauty-enhancing

85
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,212
You eat more

86
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:55,216
good

87
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,406
I also want to replenish my energy and blood

88
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,316
You are full of blood

89
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,047
No need to make up

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,628
Come

91
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:07,706
Lin'er, you are partial

92
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:08,872
Thank you Lin'er

93
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,041
Ziwei is weak

94
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,037
Here comes the wine

95
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:14,531
man

96
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:15,756
What are you doing outside? It's so busy.

97
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,925
There's a vaudeville group coming outside.

98
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,025
Your master, they all went to see it

99
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,922
juggling

100
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:23,281
I'll go see

101
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,969
The little swallow hasn't finished eating yet

102
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:26,328
Little Yanzi, wait for me

103
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,669
Don't get lost again

104
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,293
crape myrtle

105
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:29,198
Let's go and have a look too

106
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:30,041
OK

107
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,062
Lin'er, I'll eat when I get back

108
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,115
Take a walk

109
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,072
juggling

110
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:36,475
completion

111
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:39,075
I remember the assassin who killed the emperor

112
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,431
Just pretending to be a juggler

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,332
little swallow

114
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:00,048

115
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,252
Ziwei run quickly

116
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:02,989
run

117
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,338
Be careful, sir

118
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:17,373
hide

119
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:39,646
Be careful, sir

120
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,304
Ziwei girl

121
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,052
crape myrtle

122
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:53,452

Hurry up and save people

crape myrtle

127
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,799
Jing Yuan be careful

128
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:12,136

129
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,798
Come

130
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,072
Jingyuan

131
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:58,689
Jingyuan

132
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:17,493
Jingyuan

133
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:22,413
Jingyuan

134
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:24,770
Jingyuan

135
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,251
Don't cry

136
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:42,994
Jingyuan

137
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,057
Don't cry

138
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:50,498
Someone coming

139
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,086
Someone coming

140
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:54,273
Mr. Lai Renjing is injured

141
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:55,414
Come quickly

142
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,175
Someone coming

143
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,722
Someone come quickly

144
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:10,586
How is it?

145
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,311
How about it

146
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,292
Mr. Fu’s fifth elder brother

147
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:15,367
Fortunately, the golden lock blocked the way

148
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,851
Miss Ziwei’s injury is not too serious

149
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,623
Life is safe

150
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:29,416
Miss Lin'er

151
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:31,292
The life-saving grace will never be forgotten

152
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,386
How about it

153
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,242
How is he doing?

154
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,673
Kagetoto sword creation spine

155
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:47,578
The blade strikes the lungs

156
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:48,615
The situation is worrying

157
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,802
If you remain unconscious

158
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:52,827
I'm afraid it's more likely to be bad than good.

159
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,548
Jingyuan

160
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:07,689
Jingyuan

161
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,999
Jingyuan, wake up

162
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,425
wake up

163
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,586
Would you please wake up?

164
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:14,452
wake up

165
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,648
Jingyuan

166
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:26,855
sorry

167
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:28,292
It's all my fault

168
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:30,850
sorry

169
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:44,825
Lin'er

170
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,586
little swallow

171
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,407
Jing Yuan is like this now

172
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:48,712
Lin'er must be heartbroken

173
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,517
Just leave her alone for a while

174
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,692
Since he is my hero

175
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,361
I don't want him to die

176
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,298
I don't want him to die

177
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,531
I don't want him to die

178
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,771
I don't want

179
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,450
I don't want him to die

180
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,330
I don't want him to die

181
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,730
I don't want him to die

182
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,716
You can only go back if he dies

183
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,198
What did you say

184
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,876
He was a role you added without authorization

185
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:41,133
This does not belong to the Pearl Returning World

186
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:42,970
Character disappears

187
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:44,831
Only then can everyone return to their place

188
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,817
No wonder I don’t reduce numbers when talking to him

189
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:58,131
So his fate is to disappear?

190
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:10,773
No

191
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,333
Don't don't

192
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,131
I don't accept

193
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,836
I don't accept

194
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:36,963
I tried my best to get the plot back on track

195
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,473
Just want to keep myself alive

196
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:44,219
I never thought about my casual words

197
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:46,004
