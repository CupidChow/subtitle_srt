1
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,922
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,682
Xiao Yan Zi, don't be rash!

3
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,328
Yong Qi.

4
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:46,615
Does it hurt?

5
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,158
Should we get some ointment?

6
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,175
Are you alright?

7
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,775
It's going to hurt a little.

8
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:02,855
- Hang in there.   - So?

9
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:05,536
What did you find?

10
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,919
Their swords are nothing special,

11
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,096
but this hidden blade...

12
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,015
It's forged of refined steel, exquisitely crafted.

13
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,173
It's from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

14
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:18,998
The Ministry of Internal Affairs?

15
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,023
How would assassins have items from the palace?

16
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,278
It means they're no ordinary assassins.

17
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:26,239
They're from the palace.

18
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:35,455
Jing Yuan, what do we do next?

19
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:37,976
We return to the palace

20
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:39,575
and report this to His Majesty.

21
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,055
What?

22
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:45,376
Assassins?

23
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,278
Yes, Father.

24
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:49,399
Just look at how badly Yong Qi is hurt.

25
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:50,816
And Er Kang too,

26
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:54,038
he nearly got stabbed through trying to save Zi Wei!

27
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:57,199
Your Majesty, Jing Yuan examined the bodies.

28
00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:58,799
They were elite palace guards.

29
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,136
Father,

30
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:02,718
back at the Imperial Clan Court,

31
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,183
someone already claimed

32
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,303
to be acting under your orders

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,593
to torture Xiao Yan Zi, Zi Wei, and Lin Er.

34
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:09,438
And after we left the palace, we were hunted all the way.

35
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:10,795
Father,

36
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,558
it's obvious someone inside the palace wants us dead.

37
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,518
This is outrageous!

38
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,655
- Guards!   - Wait!

39
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:22,479
Your Majesty, are you going to let them fool you again?

40
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:31,998
Greetings, Your Majesty.

41
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,239
I heard you went out in disguise

42
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:41,063
and personally persuaded them to come back.

43
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,582
But they turned you down with excuses.

44
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:45,159
I knew then they must have some further scheme.

45
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:46,558
What do you mean by that?

46
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,679
When Xiao Yan Zi's false identity

47
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:53,103
as Princess Huan Zhu was exposed,

48
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:54,679
she claimed Zi Wei was the real princess.

49
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,335
But since there was no proof,

50
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:57,679
they staged this entire act

51
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,239
to play on your sympathies,

52
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:01,878
hoping to trick you into acknowledging Zi Wei immediately.

53
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:05,015
Your Majesty, you're... You're spouting lies again!

54
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,376
Your Majesty,

55
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,438
I swear to heaven,

56
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,296
if there is even half a lie in my words,

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,657
may I be struck by lightning!

58
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,335
Your Majesty, if I may be so bold,

59
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:15,856
in returning to see you,

60
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:18,039
we were staking not only your mercy,

61
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:19,679
but also your wisdom.

62
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,958
Please trust us.

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,713
All of you,

64
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:30,775
spouting nonsense and spreading lies!

65
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:33,575
But talk is cheap, where is the proof?

66
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,679
Even if Zi Wei is Xia Yu He's daughter,

67
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:39,206
that doesn't necessarily make her His Majesty's child, does it?

68
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:44,376
The proof is here!

69
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,335
Your Majesty.

70
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:18,856
What is that?

71
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,136
Your Majesty,

72
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,136
that is

73
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,479
the medical record of Zi Wei's birth.

74
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,696
Your Majesty,

75
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,438
Lord Jing and I went to Jinan and managed to find

76
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:33,198
the medical record from the day Xia Yu He gave birth,

77
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
when she suffered a hemorrhage and fell gravely ill.

78
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,839
It clearly states Zi Wei's date of birth.

79
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,638
The second day of the eighth month in the year of Xinchou,

80
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,478
Lady Xia gave birth to a girl.

81
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:56,839
The owner of the pharmacy can also testify,

82
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,376
proving that Zi Wei

83
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:03,479
is the daughter Xia Yu He bore for Your Majesty.

84
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:28,775
Zi Wei...

85
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,535
My daughter.

86
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:49,575
Father.

87
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,799
I can finally call you Father.

88
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,575
My child...

89
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:22,359
You've been through so much.

90
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:29,199
Zi Wei,

91
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:32,918
I've finally returned your father to you.

92
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,055
Your Majesty,

93
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:50,918
my investigation confirms

94
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,366
that the hidden blades found on the assassins were made

95
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,661
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

96
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:58,158
The mastermind behind this

97
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,773
is Nanny Rong of Kunning Palace.

98
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,353
Empress...

99
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:23,278
What do you have to say for yourself?

100
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,415
I...

101
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:29,736
I have done nothing wrong.

102
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,602
Even at this point,

103
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,622
with all the evidence and witnesses,

104
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:43,319
all point directly to the crimes you committed.

105
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,280
And you still claim you've done nothing wrong?

106
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:46,456
Your Majesty!

107
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:51,175
Xiao Yan Zi and Zi Wei come from lowly origins.

108
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,878
They muddle the imperial bloodline

109
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,559
and cling to the royal heirs.

110
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,518
Yet you treasure them as if they were jewels.

111
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,518
You may care nothing for the noble lineage

112
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,359
of the Aisin-Gioro bloodline,

113
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:07,295
but I have always

114
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:11,839
upheld the honor of the Ula Nara clan!

115
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,935
Very well.

116
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,278
Then I'll strip you of your title!

117
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,331
Let's see how a deposed empress upholds

118
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,119
the glory of the Ula-Nara family now!

119
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,216
Your Majesty!

120
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:30,518
I beg to take the punishment in place of Her Majesty.

121
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:37,158
Her Majesty has lived a life of honor.

122
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,599
You cannot depose her.

123
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:43,502
I beg you to take my life instead!

124
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,918
- Jing Yuan...   - So Her Majesty may retain her dignity!

125
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:48,616
Jing Yuan...

126
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,295
Father,

127
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,673
you have only just acknowledged me as your daughter.

128
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,959
Please grant me my first request as your child.

129
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:04,758
Please do not depose Her Majesty.

130
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:15,038
Vengeance only breeds more vengeance.

131
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,199
Let us instead release grudges

132
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:19,398
with a smile.

133
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,616
I do not

134
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,719
need your pity.

135
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:27,851
Your Majesty, Lord Jing didn't hesitate

136
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,518
to uphold justice against his own family

137
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:31,380
to help you find your long-lost daughter,

138
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:35,638
though it pained him deeply.

139
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,798
Now he's willing to sacrifice himself

140
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,158
to protect Her Majesty.

141
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,119
He's a subject who embodies loyalty and filial devotion.

142
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:49,918
Isn't he exactly the kind of talent Great Qing cannot afford to lose?

143
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:57,398
Please show mercy, Your Majesty!

144
00:11:57,702 --> 00:11:59,143
Please show mercy!

145
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:01,460
- Please show mercy, Your Majesty!   - Please show mercy, Father!

146
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,655
Jing Yuan,

147
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:23,576
I intend

148
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,119
to keep you alive.

149
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:29,576
As for the Empress...

150
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:33,295
From this day forward,

151
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,199
she is confined to Kunning Palace.

152
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,096
Without a summons,

153
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,038
she is not to take one step outside.

154
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:43,359
Thank you for your gracious mercy,

155
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,839
Your Majesty.

156
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:51,678
Thank you for your gracious mercy, Your Majesty.

157
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:53,423
Thank you for your gracious mercy.

158
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,284
Thank you for your gracious mercy, Father.
