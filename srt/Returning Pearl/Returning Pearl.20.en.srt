1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,360
What should I say when I see the emperor?

2
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:17,840
Have you remembered everything?

3
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:18,785
Definitely

4
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:20,152
My Fair Princess

5
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,440
Not Yu He’s daughter

6
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:22,740
Um

7
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:44,752
Yesterday, Xiao Yanzi

8
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:46,443
Still defending you in front of Princess Seiya

9
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,719
Today you propose

10
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:49,793
Bring her uncle and aunt to kill her

11
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,171
Such kindness will be repaid with hatred

12
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:52,927
Be sincere and at ease

13
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:54,343
What about you?

14
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:57,097
Don’t you also know the Queen’s plan?

15
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,037
Didn’t you tell Shufangzhai too?

16
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,399
The queen has given me the kindness to raise me

17
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,018
I have my last resort

18
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,174
How do you know I don't have it?

19
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:12,695
emperor

20
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:14,473
Ziwei cannot be a concubine

21
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:15,974
Queen

22
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:18,027
Your mother graces the world

23
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,938
should be generous

24
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,258
I don’t agree

25
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:24,464
Not jealous

26
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:25,772
But because

27
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,641
Huanzhugege’s identity is fake

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,899
people around her

29
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:31,222
Can't stay at all

30
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:35,192
How to say this

31
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:39,283
Lin'er

32
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:40,995
bring people up

33
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,737
Long live the emperor, long live the emperor

34
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,293
emperor

35
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:01,186
These two people

36
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:03,258
They are Xia Yuhe’s uncle and aunt

37
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,096
You two look up

38
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,313
tell the emperor

39
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,362
Is this Huanzhugege real or fake?

40
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,539
I have never seen this Gege before

41
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:23,246
She is not Yu He’s daughter

42
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,165
crape myrtle

43
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:31,574
she...

44
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,091
She is Yu He’s daughter

45
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,155
Xia Ziwei

46
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:36,826
What did you say?

47
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,033
August of the Renxu year

48
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,771
Yuhe gave birth to Ziwei

49
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,077
His father is unknown

50
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,089
Our family members are constantly being criticized.

51
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,941
Ziwei is Yuhe’s daughter

52
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:51,059
They both look exactly the same

53
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:53,692
father-in-law, father-in-law

54
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,528
She found her uncle and aunt

55
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,323
It turns out it wasn’t to help the queen

56
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,684
But to help Ziwei

57
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,245
Congratulations to both of you

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,270
Congratulations to both of you

59
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,965
Such unparalleled wealth

60
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,607
It's finally your turn

61
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:18,404
this...

62
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,860
Your crape myrtle

63
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,034
With the current bachelor

64
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:24,298
Falcon, the eldest son of the Fulun family

65
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:25,398
Determined for life

66
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:27,310
Then you will

67
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,642
But they are the in-laws of the Fu family.

68
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,395
Then even the emperor’s favorite concubine

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,899
That's also a relative of the Fu family

70
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:34,663
besides

71
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,242
The emperor’s favorite prince, the fifth elder brother

72
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,788
That and Ziwei

73
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,338
It's a very good relationship

74
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,929
You slander Ziwei

75
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,807
That is the crime of deceiving the emperor

76
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:47,682
The crime of deceiving the emperor requires the entire family to be executed.

77
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,456
this...

78
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,571
If you come before the emperor

79
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:55,985
Just say it

80
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:59,542
You are Ziwei’s biological aunts and uncles.

81
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,007
That's sharing weal and woe

82
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,832
That Ziwei will definitely protect you

83
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,028
Not persecuted by the Queen Empress

84
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:07,091
yes

85
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:08,816
Gone

86
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:10,620
Walk slowly

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,498
Emperor Ama

88
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:15,864
it's all my fault

89
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,835
I got an arrow in the paddock

90
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,857
when i wake up

91
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,285
you are so good to me

92
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,319
I've never been cared for like this

93
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:27,860
it's all my fault

94
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:28,885
Emperor Ama

95
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:30,733
it's all my fault

96
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:34,857
Your Majesty forgives me

97
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,520
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

98
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,704
Please forgive Xiaoyanzi and Ziwei, Huang Ama

99
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,948
emperor

100
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,892
There must be some misunderstanding

101
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,572
Now the misunderstanding has been solved

102
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,103
Let them go to their respective places

103
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:46,769
emperor

104
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:48,978
These two girls are full of lies

105
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,360
Never believe it

106
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,579
you say

107
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,326
You know Shufangzhai’s conspiracy best

108
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,910
They were also invited by you at your suggestion.

109
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:04,088
Quickly put everything

110
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,363
Explain clearly to the emperor

111
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:13,423
empress

112
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:15,299
uncle and aunt just now

113
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,324
Didn’t I already say it?

114
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,028
Little Yanzi is not the emperor’s daughter

115
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,667
Ziwei is the biological daughter of Xia Yuhe and the emperor

116
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,269
nonsense

117
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:28,763
Even you are talking nonsense

118
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,764
You have been Shufangzhai’s spy from the beginning.

119
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:38,510
Flattery to me

120
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,320
In fact, he dug a trap

121
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:41,785
Is it right to wait for me to jump?

122
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,172
The slave dare not

123
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,626
queen empress

124
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,678
If people's hearts are open-minded

125
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:48,629
No matter how others dig traps

126
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,063
I can't find any fault with you

127
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:52,363
You find your uncle and aunt

128
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:54,204
Framed to return Princess Princess

129
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,010
But I didn't expect

130
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,031
On the contrary, it proves Ziwei’s life experience

131
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,035
I'm afraid

132
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:01,656
God has eyes

133
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,138
Protect the royal bloodline

134
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:06,704
emperor

135
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:08,270
They join forces

136
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,751
Now it's a grid, now it's a grid

137
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:13,025
Trample the royal face under your feet

138
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,739
Treat it as child's play

139
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:16,554
Concubine asks for orders

140
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,107
Investigate the matter thoroughly

141
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,100
This is a big matter

142
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
First put the little swallow and crape myrtle

143
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,505
Temporarily detained in Zongren Mansion

144
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,635
Waiting for everything to be clarified

145
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,432
Let’s decide again

146
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,963
Someone coming

147
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,332
The emperor's attitude here is much better than in the original drama

148
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,173
Little Swallow and Ziwei may be spared torture

149
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:47,879
Wait

150
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:52,554
Lin'er and Xiaoyanzi

151
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:53,757
Very close

152
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,595
imprison them together

153
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,201
OK

154
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,379
Lin'er

155
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,042
Lin'er Lin'er

156
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:17,623
what are you doing

157
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:18,276
Lin'er

158
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:20,998
Lin'er

159
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,701
Lin'er Lin'er

160
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,107
are you okay

161
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,245
How did it become like this?

162
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:26,476
fine

163
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:28,448
I'm used to it

164
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:31,132
Let me see

165
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,659
this matter

166
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,637
It clearly has nothing to do with you

167
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:42,110
But you were implicated by us

168
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,881
You and I love each other as sisters

169
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,115
Live and die together

170
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,834
There's nothing to involve or involve.

171
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:00,917
The plot of Prison Disaster is correct

172
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,648
But the original golden lock

173
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,462
Why did it change to me?

174
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:07,529
Do I have anything to do with Jinsuo?

175
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:32,748
Come down

176
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,313
All dressed up

177
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,195
Quite a good look

178
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:41,094
I guess I just think I look good.

179
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,692
Even if I sharpen my head, I still want to enter the palace

180
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:47,276
What if some noble person takes a fancy to this?

181
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:48,713
Not just

182
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,017
Flying up a high branch

183
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:51,152
That

184
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:53,342
It depends on her own destiny

185
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,707
This is the rule in the palace

186
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,243
Can't bear the hardship

187
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:58,757
Leave as soon as possible

188
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,820
Finally entered the palace

189
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,351
I must not leave

190
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,585
The lady is still waiting for news from me.

191
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,329
crape myrtle

192
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:30,538
Lin'er

193
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:31,898
Lin'er

194
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,913
Lin'er

195
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:34,815
Lin'er Lin'er Lin'er

196
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:36,170
Lin'er

197
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:39,804
are you okay

198
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:42,404
The content just now

199
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:45,101
Is it the memory of the original owner of this body?

200
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,116
why at this time

201
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,501
Awakening the memory of the original owner

202
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,370
Is the plot almost over?

203
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,742
I'm going to put it back on

204
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:53,642
Are you okay, Lin'er?

205
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,676
what do you want to do

206
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:00,513
what are you going to do

207
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:01,438
what do you want to do

208
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:03,223
Why let her go?

209
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,123
let her go

210
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,392
Lin'er

211
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:06,142
let her go

212
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,075
open

213
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,925
Lin'er Lin'er

214
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:13,692
Lin'er Lin'er

215
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,282
who

216
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:34,698
Who are you

217
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,338
I tell you

218
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,579
I'm with you

219
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,306
Be careful with Mr. Si Jing

220
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,140
Very close relationship

221
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,198
If you dare to touch me

222
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:46,793
He'll cut you into pieces

223
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:48,410
oh

224
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:50,740
Yeah

225
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:15,672
I have found out

226
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:17,606
Among the Southern Tour Team

227
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:19,792
No one has ever gone to Jinan to check on the Xia family

228
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:21,580
how did you know

229
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:23,044
Ziwei has uncles and aunts

230
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:26,659
I...

231
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,792
I heard it from Xiaoyanzi

232
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,016
My patience is limited

233
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,020
If you keep talking nonsense like this

234
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,743
This dagger will not miss the target next time

235
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,939
I have checked the files of the Department of Punishment

236
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,022
The trial a few days ago

237
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,159
The Case of Selling the Identity of a Palace Maid

238
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:54,843
In order to survive

239
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:57,388
Tell the Queen about returning Princess Princess

240
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,706
At that time you claimed to be the Fairy of Yaochi

241
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:00,890
Able to predict the future

242
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,039
But I, Jingyuan

243
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:03,862
I never believe in ghosts and gods

244
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,552
But how did you know

245
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,073
Things thousands of miles away

246
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:12,758
tell me
