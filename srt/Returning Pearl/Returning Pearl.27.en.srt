1
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,922
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,744
Your Highness, Lady Zi Wei, you're finally back!

3
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,824
We've been on edge in Shufang Hall.

4
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,393
We were so worried!

5
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,602
I missed you all so much!

6
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:28,033
Not only are we back,

7
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:30,904
but His Majesty has also recognized Zi Wei.

8
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:34,152
I'll soon be returning the title of Princess Huan Zhu to her.

9
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,193
Greetings, Princess Zi Wei!

10
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:39,792
Zi  Wei will be Princess Ming Zhu.

11
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,944
You, Princess Huan Zhu, are going to keep your title firmly.

12
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:43,033
Get up.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,173
Then we must prepare plenty of tea and refreshments

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,320
for both of our princesses.

15
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,503
Yes!

16
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,410
- Prepare more, lots more!   - We'll prepare a lot!

17
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,785
A whole lot!

18
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,493
- Don't take too long!   - Yes, Your Highness.

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,466
Let's sit down.

20
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,944
Lin Er, it's mostly thanks to you

21
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,713
that I could acknowledge my father.

22
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:05,409
Zi Wei, you're beautiful and kind.

23
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:08,753
You deserve all of this joy and happiness.

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,636
Lin Er,

25
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:14,072
I haven't had a chance to ask you,

26
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:17,072
when you went to Jinan, besides verifying my background,

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,728
did you find Jin Suo?

28
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,050
Did you?

29
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:28,193
Actually...

30
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,672
It turns out that I am Jin Suo.

31
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:37,553
You're Jin Suo?

32
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,713
You're joking, right?

33
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,063
Why would I joke about something this serious?

34
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:47,369
Back then,

35
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:51,024
Jin Suo entered the palace to help Zi Wei find her father,

36
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,383
but her identity was exposed.

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,113
She was taken to the Department of Punishments.

38
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:56,653
Right at that moment, I entered this world

39
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,792
and lost her memories.

40
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:00,210
That's why

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,359
I thought I was just an ordinary palace maid.

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,090
Jin Suo did so much for me in silence.

43
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,873
But looking at your face now,

44
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,193
why can I still not remember her?

45
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,490
I'm so terrible.

46
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,912
Zi Wei, you mustn't blame yourself.

47
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,352
It's because I entered this world

48
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,153
and took Jin Suo's place,

49
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,993
the story erased everything about her.

50
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:31,280
Then please be Jin Suo one more time.

51
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:34,832
Let me express my gratitude.

52
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,249
Jin Suo.

53
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:40,770
Thank you.

54
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,609
Lord Jing, have something sweet.

55
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:54,353
Princess Huan Zhu and Princess Ming Zhu have taken their rightful places.

56
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,359
Everyone is celebrating,

57
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:00,913
but this must be hardest for you.

58
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,010
I know

59
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:07,753
this must be very difficult for you.

60
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,336
It's alright.

61
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,089
I understand.

62
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:14,433
Because this was always the ending written in the story.

63
00:05:14,984 --> 00:05:16,210
Jing Yuan,

64
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:18,753
- I...   - I'm not saying this to blame you.

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,169
In fact, I'm relieved.

66
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:26,673
Knowing this was the destined outcome,

67
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,793
it actually

68
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,553
made it easier when Her Majesty

69
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,152
severed ties with me.

70
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:36,250
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:38,089
It's all my fault.

72
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,824
You ended up so lonely because of me.

73
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,130
Don't apologize.

74
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,993
Sui Sui, you know,

75
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,489
when I learned

76
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:49,832
that I existed because of you,

77
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:51,930
that my very being,

78
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:55,152
my loneliness, were all meant to lead me to you,

79
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:57,433
I stopped feeling resentful.

80
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,032
I stopped feeling lost.

81
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:05,313
To have lived this life...

82
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,409
To have met you...

83
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,032
That alone makes everything worthwhile.

84
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:21,832
If I were given the chance to choose my fate again...

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,490
As long as I could meet you,

86
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,913
as long as I could love you...

87
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:33,392
I would live this life all over again.

88
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,913
If you could choose again...

89
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,152
Would you still want to meet me?

90
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:50,770
I would.

91
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,370
Jing Yuan.

92
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:56,553
To me,

93
00:06:58,263 --> 00:07:00,032
you are no longer just a character in a story.

94
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,072
You have

95
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:09,272
stepped into my life.

96
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,472
Into my heart.

97
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,409
Jing Yuan.

98
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:23,489
I love you.

99
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:34,592
Hearing you say that

100
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:36,433
makes even death a regretless choice.

101
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,472
What is this thing

102
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:18,753
called love...

103
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,330
That it makes one

104
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:22,313
pledge life itself?

105
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:27,592
Such a precious thing.

106
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:30,072
Yet I ruined it when I lost my memory.

107
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,602
What a shame.

108
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:33,104
It's not your fault.

109
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,913
Blame that stupid system.

110
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,530
Even so,

111
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,553
I shouldn't have been so rash

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,009
when I got my memories back.

113
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:47,033
You're the male lead in my epic romance.

114
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:50,072
If you couldn't even bring yourself to tear a little bookmark,

115
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,112
wouldn't that ruin your character setting?

116
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,592
The bookmark is ruined...

117
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:59,393
But I have something better for you.

118
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:04,952
What could be more precious than a token of love?

119
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:08,969
Take a guess.

120
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,210
My guess?

121
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:14,126
It's Lin Sui Sui.

122
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,210
Shameless.

123
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:19,290
Are you mad?

124
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:28,260
Wait.

125
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,129
Candied hawthorn.

126
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,599
I don't want it.

127
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,290
Wait.

128
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:39,273
Did the candied hawthorn upset you?

129
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,369
When Princess Sai Ya came,

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,801
you bought two sticks for her

131
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,712
and gave them to her right in front of me.

132
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:49,712
But I'd lost my memory then.

133
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,170
So what if you lost your memory?

134
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:53,072
Does that mean you can like someone else?

135
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:56,063
You think you could get a free pass just because you lost your memory?

136
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,369
Candied hawthorn!

137
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:58,984
Alright now.

138
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,290
I couldn't.

139
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:01,930
Never.

140
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,832
I promise you,

141
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,433
in this life and the next,

142
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:10,783
you are the only one I can fall for.

143
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,089
How's that?

144
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,609
Sui Sui,

145
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,393
besides candied hawthorn, what else would you like to eat?

146
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,849
I want

147
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:27,943
roast duck,

148
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:29,249
pig's trotters,

149
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:30,744
braised pork,

150
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,832
coffee, cake, ice cream.

151
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:34,904
Roast duck and pig's trotters we have.

152
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:38,104
But coffee, cake, and ice cream...

153
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,793
Are those foods from your world?

154
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:41,752
We don't have them here.

155
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,072
But they're really delicious.

156
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:48,513
Sui Sui, I've always been curious,

157
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:51,926
in your world, what's your name?

158
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,673
My name...

159
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:57,752
My name is also Lin Sui Sui.

160
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:01,592
Good. In our world,

161
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:05,040
a person's name carries deep meaning.

162
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,144
It holds their destiny,

163
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:08,592
their very soul.

164
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,450
So, Sui Sui,

165
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,513
when you feel that longing,

166
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:15,033
maybe it's that other world missing you.

167
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:17,793
'Sui Sui' is a wonderful name.

168
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,450
I like it very much.

169
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,530
Jing Yuan,

170
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,633
I really miss home.

171
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,449
I miss my mom and dad,

172
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,489
my manager,

173
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:32,930
my assistant,

174
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:34,410
my fans.

175
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,513
I even miss my haters.

176
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:45,472
You have no idea how wonderful and convenient my world is.

177
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,712
If it were possible,

178
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,486
I'd love to take you there to see it.

179
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:56,530
Tell me then,

180
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:59,313
what can I do right now to make you feel better?

181
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,872
I'd like a bowl of the wontons

182
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:10,952
my mom used to make when I was little.

183
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,384
Alright.

184
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,992
Then let's go make some wontons right now.
