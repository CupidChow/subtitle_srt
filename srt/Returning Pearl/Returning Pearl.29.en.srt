1
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,722
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:16,851
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:20,280
(One, write a note)

4
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,721
(to accompany him forever in my place.)

5
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:26,560
(Two, watch the sunrise and sunset once)

6
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,961
(and remember him at his best in my memories.)

7
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:32,120
(Three, make a feast)

8
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:34,721
(so he will remember the meal forever.)

9
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,991
(Four, eat tanghulu together.)

10
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,274
(Five, stay with each other for a whole day doing nothing.)

11
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:48,120
(Six, get married.)

12
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,200
There are still so many things

13
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,721
that I want to do with him

14
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:03,640
but there are only three days.

15
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,161
It's impossible.

16
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,401
Sui Sui.

17
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,686
The situation along the Burmese border is growing tense.

18
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,200
Fifth Prince and Er Kang

19
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:16,664
have volunteered

20
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,520
to lead the army to quell the unrest.

21
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,321
They will leave in two days.

22
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:22,800
Are you going as well?

23
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:26,321
His Majesty wants me to stay in the palace.

24
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:29,760
Why are you crying?

25
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,920
Everyone is going their separate ways.

26
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,080
Beautiful moments are always temporary.

27
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,360
Did you write all these?

28
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,704
Let me see.

29
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,465
These are

30
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,080
things I want to do with you.

31
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:03,721
But it's too late.

32
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,225
Tell me,

33
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,065
Sui Sui.

34
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:13,537
Which of these

35
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,777
do you want to do most?

36
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,041
I want to do all of them.

37
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,025
What about you?

38
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,121
Which one do you want to do most?

39
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,360
I want to do everything in the world

40
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:32,800
with you.

41
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:39,441
However, the thing I want to do most

42
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:46,824
is this.

43
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,954
(Get married)

44
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,025
Are you sure?

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,121
Getting married

46
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,121
is something you do with the one you spend your life with.

47
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,041
I'm satisfied

48
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,560
to see you write this down as your wish.

49
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:43,465
- Yong Qi, I want to go with you.   - Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

50
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:44,761
I can fight as well.

51
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,083
Absolutely not.

52
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,144
If I bring you along,

53
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:48,680
I'll be too busy worrying about you.

54
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:50,304
How do I fight on the battlefield?

55
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:51,521
I want to go.

56
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,065
Listen to me.

57
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,944
After leaving, I'm sure you'll be gone for a while.

58
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,024
Xiao Yan Zi.

59
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,041
Lin Er.

60
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:01,824
Lin Er.

61
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:03,560
In the story you read,

62
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,641
Fifth Prince and Er Kang have returned safely, right?

63
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,625
Zi Wei,

64
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,065
I guarantee

65
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,041
to protect myself well.

66
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:22,545
Yong Qi and I

67
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:24,680
will come back safely.

68
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:26,305
Yes.

69
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:30,945
With me in the palace,

70
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:32,105
both of you can rest assured.

71
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:36,161
I will protect the safety of both princesses

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,042
and wait for both of you to come back.

73
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,464
All right.

74
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:55,521
I, the Jade Pond Deity, have made a divination.

75
00:05:57,384 --> 00:06:00,025
Yong Qi and Er Kang

76
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,264
are good men who protect the kingdom.

77
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,841
They will be together with Xiao Yan Zi

78
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,281
and Zi Wei

79
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,017
until they grow old.

80
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,920
Thank you, Jade Pond Deity.

81
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:20,240
Although we will no longer meet after we say our goodbyes today,

82
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,824
I, Er Kang, will forever remember your grace.

83
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:30,961
Yes. We will always miss you in this world.

84
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:36,601
Lin Er.

85
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:39,120
Shufang Hall is supposed to be bustling

86
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,641
but Zi Wei and I will soon be the only ones left.

87
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:46,360
Didn't you say the story you read

88
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,161
was a story about me?

89
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,704
But what I want

90
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,000
is for all of us to be together

91
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,041
without anyone leaving.

92
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,305
Xiao Yan Zi.

93
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,729
Because your story is still going on.

94
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,761
You are going to experience everything in life

95
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:04,000
to become the real female lead.

96
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,865
I don't want to become the female lead.

97
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,240
I only want to be Xiao Yan Zi

98
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,418
who eats and has fun as I wish.

99
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:21,776
Xiao Yan Zi,

100
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,024
it's time to grow up.

101
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,841
Learn well from Master Ji.

102
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,178
You are smart

103
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:27,601
and you have Zi Wei to accompany you.

104
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,865
When I return in triumph,

105
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:32,041
I hope to see a different Princess Huan Zhu.

106
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:33,784
All right.

107
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,281
Yong Qi, don't worry.

108
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:38,920
When you return,

109
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:44,401
I will show you a different Xiao Yan Zi.

110
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,641
Is this the "Painting of the Divine Dragon's Return"?

111
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,601
This is so majestic.

112
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,401
Zi Wei, this is a good method.

113
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,841
You will paint a dragon scale every day.

114
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,761
If you do that, the divine dragon will manifest itself

115
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,624
after 81 days

116
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:24,641
and they will return.

117
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:27,281
Not just me. We will paint it together.

118
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,672
I'm using the "Ninety-nine Days of Winter Solstice Diagram" as a reference.

119
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:33,761
By doing this, when we miss them,

120
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:37,129
we can count how many unpainted dragon scales are left

121
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,001
to see how many days are left until their triumphant return.

122
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:42,824
Yes.

123
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,145
Come on.

124
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,920
No, Zi Wei.

125
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,024
I'm worried that my drawing skills are bad.

126
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,345
If the divine dragon gets angry,

127
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,825
it won't manifest itself.

128
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:09,281
You should do it.

129
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:12,557
Xiao Yan Zi, being sincere is the most important thing.

130
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,094
Whether you do good or not isn't important.

131
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:16,464
Hold it.

132
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,161
After I leave,

133
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:40,600
Jing Yuan will probably miss me like this.

134
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:44,680
After all, he doesn't belong to this world.

135
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,800
I forcefully added him in.

136
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,857
However,

137
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:58,080
having a group of like-minded friends,

138
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,800
he will probably be happy

139
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,200
even without me.

140
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,217
(He is born from love. Without love, he'll be gone.)

141
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,600
(Jing Yuan was forcefully added by you.)

142
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,800
(After you leave, he will vanish.)

143
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,018
Vanish?

144
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,881
How?

145
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,241
How will he vanish?

146
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:22,585
What do you mean?

147
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,241
(It's all an illusion, there's no need to be obsessed.)

148
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,185
- Lin Er.   - Lin Er.

149
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:32,800
- Lin Er.   - Lin Er.

150
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:34,577
What's wrong, Lin Er?

151
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:36,937
I can't do it.

152
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:42,778
I...

153
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,361
I'm going to find Jing Yuan.

154
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:46,584
Lin Er.

155
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,065
- Lin Er.   - Lin Er!

156
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:06,545
Jing Yuan.

157
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:08,224
Sui Sui.

158
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:10,504
Jing Yuan, I'm not leaving.

159
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,624
- I'm not leaving.   - Sui Sui, calm down.

160
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:14,778
What happened?

161
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:16,224
I'm not leaving.

162
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,425
I'm not going to leave.

163
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:20,744
Speak slowly.

164
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:22,584
It's all right.

165
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,281
What happened?

166
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:30,898
If I leave...

167
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:34,840
If I leave, you'll vanish.

168
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:37,344
What?

169
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:39,080
The System said

170
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,800
you were a character I forcefully added.

171
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,058
Once I leave,

172
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:47,800
you will vanish.

173
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,457
I see.

174
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,065
Sui Sui.

175
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,065
Actually,

176
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,800
this is also a good thing.

177
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,920
Since I was born because of you,

178
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,440
it is only natural

179
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:11,545
for me to vanish

180
00:12:13,704 --> 00:12:15,041
after you return.

181
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,104
Jing Yuan, I don't want that.

182
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,761
Instead of living like a zombie

183
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:27,320
after you leave,

184
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:30,080
it's better to let me vanish into thin air.

185
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,521
Perhaps I can go to your world

186
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,481
and accompany you by your side.

187
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:45,617
I don't want that.

188
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:47,545
I don't want that.

189
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:49,265
Jing Yuan,

190
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,920
I'd rather not go back

191
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:52,840
than see you vanish.

192
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:55,104
Sui Sui,

193
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:57,361
I'd rather vanish

194
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,281
than see you stay here.

195
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:04,385
Listen to me.

196
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,361
We'll let everything

197
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:09,241
return to its original state.
