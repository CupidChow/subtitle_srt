1
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,922
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:17,487
Lord Jing.

3
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:20,528
Lord Jing.

4
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:24,863
Greetings, Your Majesty.

5
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,264
Yuan, you are here.

6
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:35,423
I thought you'd never step foot into Kunning Palace again.

7
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:38,600
Your Majesty,

8
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,991
The situation along the Burmese border is growing tense.

9
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,503
His Majesty mobilized troops to quell the unrest.

10
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,950
I was busy with official matters

11
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:47,663
so I couldn't visit Your Majesty.

12
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,134
Please forgive me

13
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,264
for being rude.

14
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,423
Yuan, you've grown up.

15
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,423
You have your mother's eyes.

16
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:15,488
This is...

17
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:20,943
When you were a child,

18
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:25,122
you were envious of the other princes because they had pouches

19
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,503
sewn by their mothers.

20
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:28,744
I knew that

21
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,103
but I only wanted you to study hard

22
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:35,744
and failed to realize the importance of a pouch sewn by your mother.

23
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:38,424
Now, I finally have time.

24
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:41,800
However,

25
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,624
I don't know if you still need it, Yuan.

26
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:51,648
I need it.

27
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,601
This is

28
00:02:57,488 --> 00:02:59,064
the most exquisite pouch I've ever seen.

29
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,383
I'm unfilial.

30
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,823
You raised me up

31
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,263
and educated me

32
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:16,823
but I have to leave before I can repay you

33
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,488
for raising me.

34
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:21,887
You're leaving?

35
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:25,864
I'm sure you are leaving with Lin Er.

36
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:29,744
It's fine if you've thought it through.

37
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,503
I will not trouble you again.

38
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:33,648
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,344
this has nothing to do with Lin Er.

40
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:36,768
It's because I...

41
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,663
There's no need to explain, Yuan.

42
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:54,503
I've thought it through during this period.

43
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,688
I will leave matters of the rear palace

44
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:57,943
and devote to Buddhism.

45
00:03:58,248 --> 00:03:59,248
Consort Ling

46
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:00,647
will take care of His Majesty.

47
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,144
I can rest assured.

48
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,223
As for you,

49
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,848
you've already

50
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:12,503
reached an age where you can decide for yourself.

51
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,487
Go on.

52
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:22,424
The only thing I can do

53
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,823
is to pray for blessings for you.

54
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,400
Your Majesty,

55
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,143
this is the jade pendant

56
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,703
Mother left behind when I was young.

57
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,023
Whenever I see it,

58
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,583
it feels like my mother is still by my side.

59
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,104
I'm giving it to you now.

60
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,583
If you miss me,

61
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:26,624
just look at it

62
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,241
and think of it

63
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,624
as my mother and me are still by your side.

64
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:39,784
From now on,

65
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,383
with distances so vast and days so long,

66
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,503
who knows when we will meet again?

67
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,544
But no matter where I am,

68
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,624
I hope Your Majesty

69
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,583
can have a pure heart

70
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,784
and a healthy body.

71
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,528
I will

72
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,600
bid farewell now.

73
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:44,927
Are you ready?

74
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,448
Yes.

75
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:53,903
I remember

76
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:55,784
everything you told me.

77
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,367
However,

78
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,664
I can't give you cakes, coffee, and ice cream.

79
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:04,568
So, I...

80
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,664
I have no regrets

81
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,864
about having you love me like this.

82
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:40,943
After drinking this cross-cupped wine,

83
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,943
I will be yours.

84
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,208
Sui Sui.

85
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,463
It'll be the hour of Zi soon.

86
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:15,281
I should leave.

87
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,223
Jing Yuan, don't go.

88
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,223
I don't want you to leave.

89
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,743
Go back.

90
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,863
Go back to your own world.

91
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:47,897
Remember.

92
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,863
You once had someone called Jing Yuan

93
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,024
who was willing to live with you forever.

94
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,521
(Lin, it's the hour of Zi. Leave immediately.)

95
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:27,384
(Otherwise, you'll also vanish forever.)

96
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,343
I...

97
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,184
I've returned.

98
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,630
Sui Sui.

99
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,120
- Sui Sui.   - Sui Sui, how are you?

100
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,623
Sui Sui, how are you?

101
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,544
Are you feeling better?

102
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,221
- Sui Sui, are you all right?   - Do you feel unwell?

103
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,823
You scared me when the light fell.

104
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:49,048
Sui Sui, are you all right?

105
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,128
The set is ready

106
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,223
and the script has been amended according to our request.

107
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,401
Do you think

108
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:56,264
you can still continue?

109
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,943
If you still feel unwell, let's not force it.

110
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,092
- Can you do it?   - Yes.

111
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,303
- I'm fine.   - Are you all right?

112
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:08,656
Let's go.

113
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,583
I've made everyone wait.

114
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:13,328
I'm fine.

115
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:14,928
Slow down.
