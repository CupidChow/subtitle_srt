1
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:13,840
(Returning Pearl)

2
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,647
Xiao Yan Zi is a vulgar and cunning girl.

3
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,567
But just using Lin Er alone might not be enough.

4
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,027
Your Majesty, are you suggesting...

5
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:25,287
Yuan is dashing and promising.

6
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:28,445
Lord Jing is of the Ula Nara bloodline.

7
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,440
He's far too good for the likes of Xiao Yan Zi.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,936
Once Xiao Yan Zi becomes your daughter-in-law,

9
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:36,539
you can mold her and control her

10
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,287
however you wish.

11
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,688
If that child could become a son-in-law of the royal family,

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,976
I will have done my duty by my sister.

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,598
Yes, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,968
If their plan succeeds,

15
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:50,048
things will be even more of a mess!

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,633
No way.

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,201
Lord Jing

18
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:56,480
is my life-saving insurance, okay?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,296
I can't let him break up Xiao Yan Zi and Fifth Prince!

20
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,687
They're about to have physical contact! No!

21
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:47,448
Princess Huan Zhu!

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,913
Here.

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,416
It's okay now.

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,913
What does "okay" mean?

25
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,704
It means, "oh, it's good."

26
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:15,664
It's a compliment.

27
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,017
Now, try it.

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,585
- So?   - It's so good!

29
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,585
It's okay! Very okay!

30
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:30,298
Oh, it's good.

31
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:40,602
I've never tasted anything this good, not in the palace or out there.

32
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,080
Does it have a name?

33
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,807
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan Zi.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,895
I've wasted too many words talking to you.

35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,488
I've got an idea.

36
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,864
It's called Lin's Bubble Milk Tea!

37
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:58,951
Lin's Bubble Milk Tea.

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,682
Anyway, the important thing is, I'm finally free of that Nanny Rong!

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,893
Your Highness, Nanny Rong may be strict,

40
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:08,359
but she's a senior in the palace.

41
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,720
You would do well to learn from her.

42
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,415
I can learn!

43
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,920
But can't I learn from someone else?

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,535
Nanny Rong is terrifying!

45
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,336
How about this? I'll learn from Consort Ling.

46
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,495
She's beautiful and kind. I like her.

47
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,002
What about Fifth Prince?

48
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,880
How about you learn from His Highness?

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,394
I mean, you could have Fifth Prince teach you. How about it?

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,365
Fifth Prince?

51
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,640
You mean the one who shot me with an arrow?

52
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,776
I'm being polite by not cracking his head open!

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,720
That was just an unfortunate misunderstanding.

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,280
Fifth Prince is a great man.

55
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,240
His Highness is His Majesty's favourite son.

56
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,820
His Majesty is very wise.

57
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,953
So if he favors him, how could he possibly be bad?

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,506
Isn't that right?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,536
Why are you looking at Lord Jing

60
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,896
when you're talking to me?

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,793
I twisted my neck when I fell earlier. It's stuck.

62
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,053
- I'll adjust it for you.   - No need!

63
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:04,914
Thank you.

64
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:09,240
Your Highness,

65
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,115
Her Majesty has asked me to find you

66
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,018
some beginner-level books to start with.

67
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,453
As a newcomer to the palace, there is much to learn.

68
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,734
A solid foundation is essential.

69
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,962
How thoughtful of you, Lord Jing.

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,080
I can't read.

71
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,081
I believe that with diligence and a desire to learn,

72
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,376
you will make progress in due time.

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,616
Well, Lord Jing can certainly help with that.

74
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,600
His nickname in the palace is

75
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,435
the "Living King of Hell,"

76
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,480
The Living King of Hell?

77
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,296
When I was in the Laundry Bureau,

78
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,416
I saw him execute an old nanny right on the spot!

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,417
He executed her on the spot!

80
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,513
There was a family in the northern suburbs.

81
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,329
The daughter never wanted to be a palace maid,

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
but her father, blinded by money,

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,580
used Nanny Song's connections

84
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:56,397
to force her into service.

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,137
For three years, the girl's monthly stipend was taken by Nanny Song.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,600
In the end, the girl could bear it no longer

87
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,181
and threw herself down a well.

88
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,226
Your Highness,

89
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:10,076
do you think Nanny Song's death was unjust?

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Not all all! She deserved it!

91
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,550
The palace may appear peaceful on the surface,

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,773
but in reality, there is danger everywhere.

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,873
You are new here, Your Highness.

94
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,553
You must be cautious

95
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,680
and not let yourself be deceived by those with ill intentions.

96
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:33,200
Being able to make a friend like you in the palace is a blessing.

97
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,627
Don't worry, Lord Jing.

98
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,497
I'll listen to you and study hard.

99
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,082
Good.

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,656
Those sparkling, admiring eyes are supposed to be for Fifth Prince!

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,936
How has the plot gotten so derailed?

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Looks like the first step to fixing this story

103
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,496
is to make Xiao Yan Zi dislike Jing Yuan.

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,217
You look so harmless,

105
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,937
but you're quite manipulative, huh?

106
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:04,056
Yuan, Princess Huan Zhu has only just entered the palace.

107
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,536
You must look after her well.

108
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,513
What is he writing?

109
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,496
A love letter?

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,496
For who?

111
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:33,536
Could it be for Xiao Yan Zi?

112
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,775
You're the first person brave enough

113
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,937
to spy outside my window.

114
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,286
Go back.

115
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:12,200
And don't do it again.

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Why did you reach out your hand?

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,697
I need to talk to you.

118
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,240
Come in.

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,833
You...

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm going to get something on you

121
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,137
and expose your true colors.

122
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,713
It's improper for a man and a woman to be alone in a room at this hour.

123
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:50,966
So whatever you have to say, say it quickly.

124
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,714
What's the matter?

125
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:55,434
Are you scared?

126
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:59,594
I'm not going to bite you.

127
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,522
Bedside reading...

128
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,456
Don't tell me you're...

129
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,723
I'm going to expose you!

130
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,577
I'm here to borrow a book.

131
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,000
That one.

132
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,153
Why would a palace maid be studying military strategy?

133
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,146
Military strategy?

134
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,806
(The Art of War)

135
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:27,697
I should've known.

136
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,257
When I was little,

137
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,817
The Art of War

138
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,016
was my father's favorite book.

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,695
But before he could finish teaching me,

140
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,336
he passed away.

141
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,363
My father, too.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,377
If you want this book,

143
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,832
I'll lend it to you.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,073
What did you say?

145
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,033
I said

146
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,776
don't ask questions you shouldn't.

147
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,353
These practice sheets

148
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,256
are clearly meant for a beginner.

149
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,386
These are for Princess Huan Zhu, aren't they?

150
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,314
That's none of your concern.

151
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,840
Everyone in the palace knows

152
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,376
you and I are a couple.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,060
If you're seen fawning over Her Highness,

154
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,560
you'll be known as a two-timing scoundrel.

155
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,753
You...

156
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,873
So...

157
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:52,856
I'll deliver these for you.

158
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,497
That way, your precious reputation remains intact.

159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,553
Bye!

160
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,593
Wait.

161
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:08,827
Use the door.

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,096
I'll keep it quiet.

163
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,256
Outrageous! This is utterly disgraceful!

164
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Sir, why are you so angry?

165
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,360
Look, the turtle's drawn really well!

166
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,846
- Your Highness!   - Xiao Yan Zi.

167
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,760
You can't scribble on your practice sheet.

168
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,337
- Apologize to Mister Ji at once.   - I didn't draw this.

169
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,496
I got this from Lord Jing. I didn't even open it.

170
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,736
I have to get the plot back on track.

171
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,057
I'm sorry for setting you up,

172
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,896
Xiao Yan Zi.

173
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:02,136
I'm sure Fifth Prince will help you out.

174
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:05,882
Such mischief!

175
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,713
You're to copy the Three Character Classic a hundred times.

176
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,526
A hundred times?

177
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
- But I...   - Mister Ji, Xiao Yan Zi's injury hasn't fully healed.

178
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,853
- Look at Fifth Prince.   - I'll take the punishment for her.

179
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,736
See how good Fifth Prince is to you?

180
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,946
Not like Jing Yuan, who got you scolded and punished.

181
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:31,696
Whoever framed Her Highness knows perfectly well who they are.

182
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,055
Sharp ears.

183
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:36,866
Sir.

184
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,146
The princes and princesses exclusively use the high-quality tribute ink

185
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,937
from the Imperial Household, ideal for calligraphy and painting.

186
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,719
Burdened with official duties,

187
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,896
I use the more common pine soot ink for writing.

188
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,935
However, the person who drew this turtle

189
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,438
used the most ordinary Hui ink found in the palace.

190
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,055
So someone pretended to be Jing Yuan

191
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,202
just to frame Xiao Yan Zi.

192
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,846
Yes. Who would do such a thing?

193
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,183
And with what motive?

194
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,493
It was me!

195
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,856
Sir, I drew the turtle.

196
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,233
I'll accept the punishment!

197
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,873
Hang on...
