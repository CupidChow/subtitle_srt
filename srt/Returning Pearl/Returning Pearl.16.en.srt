1
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,779
Lin'er Lin'er

2
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:28,402
Jing Yuan has been saved. Jing Yuan has been saved.

3
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:29,039
The imperial doctor said

4
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,864
There is such a herbal medicine in the eastern suburbs valley

5
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:31,886
His name is Xuanhu

6
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,939
Leaf veins like wild goose feathers

7
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:33,845
Can produce muscle and stop bleeding

8
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,619
As long as I can find this herb

9
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:36,936
Jing Yuan's injury can be saved

10
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,614
Although this drug is rare

11
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:39,758
But there is always a glimmer of hope

12
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:40,689
right

13
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:41,995
Let's go to the eastern suburbs valley now

14
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
Find herbs for him

15
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:43,527
Walk

16
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,748
The valley in the eastern suburbs is so big

17
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,539
Where to find a herb

18
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:54,573
Lin'er

19
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,369
Are you giving up on him now?

20
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,289
You have to give up on him before he's dead

21
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:04,787
Lin Suisui

22
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:05,333
little swallow

23
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,675
He was injured trying to save you

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Lin Suisui

25
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,517
Can't look back

26
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,807
They are not just paper figures in storybooks

27
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:17,220
they are my friends

28
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,199
I can only go back

29
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:24,677
Only then can our destiny and yours return to the right track.

30
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,202
Xuan Hu looks like this

31
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:37,225
Find it like this

32
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,880
Erkang

33
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:39,413
Erkang

34
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:40,045
Come

35
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,033
Are you feeling better?

36
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:42,842
crape myrtle

37
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:44,844
Erkang

38
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:45,988
How is Jing Yuan doing?

39
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:47,477
The imperial doctor said

40
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,741
If Xuanhu can't be found again

41
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:49,980
I am afraid

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,361
Days are numbered

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,260
crape myrtle

44
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:55,245
Your injury is just right

45
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,869
Don't come with us to collect medicine.

46
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:59,373
Lin'er's current situation

47
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,477
Only you can take good care of her

48
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:02,942
Just take good care of her at home

49
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:05,647
What Xiao Yanzi said is

50
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,642
Lin'er, I'll leave it to you.

51
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:10,010
I think she might be too sad

52
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:10,889
Momentary hysteria

53
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,375
Ask the imperial doctor to take a look at her too.

54
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,498
good

55
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:14,780
Then go ahead

56
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:15,739
I'm here

57
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:17,243
Then have a good rest at home

58
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,029
Um

59
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,112
Let's go

60
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,011
Walk

61
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,233
give it to me

62
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:22,017
Um

63
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:23,042
Good to go

64
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:24,972
Wait for me

65
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,152
Be careful, little swallow

66
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:37,927
Yin and Yang are separated and pulse Qi is not continuous.

67
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,161
If there is no more Xuanhu to save my life

68
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
I am afraid

69
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,245
But we searched all over and couldn't find Xuan Hu.

70
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:43,895
That...

71
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:48,155
Mr. Jing can't survive the night

72
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,077
you two

73
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:50,142
Find a way for me

74
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,267
anyway

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,660
We have to let Jing Yuan maintain it

76
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:53,655
obey the decree

77
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:56,904
Erkang

78
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,877
More people will be sent tomorrow

79
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,286
Be sure to find Xuan Hu

80
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,430
obey the decree

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,914
I can go home soon

82
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,048
I should be happy

83
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,433
But

84
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:25,775
But my heart

85
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,597
Why does it hurt so much?

86
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,867
He's just a paper person

87
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,111
Why do you have to remember it so much?

88
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,130
If you keep him

89
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,577
all this you did

90
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,336
Wouldn’t it be a waste of all your efforts?

91
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:03,098
It's just a play

92
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:05,823
you want to go back

93
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:08,664
Want to go back

94
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,176
I want to go back

95
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,102
Erkang

96
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,467
tomorrow

97
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,983
I don’t know if I can find Xuan Hu as I wish.

98
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,606
I was just thinking about it

99
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,671
We still need to make some preparations for his funeral.

100
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:31,749
Be sure to give a generous burial

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,983
yes

102
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,261
Since the feelings are real

103
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,864
So these people to me

104
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,344
They are all real people with flesh and blood.

105
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:57,313
Under this valley

106
00:06:57,673 --> 00:06:59,233
They've searched all over Little Swallow

107
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:00,258
None found

108
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,620
Definitely no more

109
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,433
They haven't been to the mountain yet

110
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:14,999
Maybe there is hope

111
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,586
mountain

112
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,795
There is probably hope on the mountain

113
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:38,945
No

114
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,564
you can't die

115
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:00,730
I won't let you die

116
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,275
You are not allowed to die

117
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,711
I won't let you die

118
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:06,823
I won't let you die

119
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:08,776
I don't agree with your death

120
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,402
Lin'er Lin'er

121
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:28,427
Lin'er

122
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:32,889
Xuanhu

123
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,383
I'm going to see the doctor

124
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:36,317
Go quickly

125
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:37,863
Lin'er

126
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,573
where did you find this

127
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,599
Why did you bleed so much?

128
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,186
Very good

129
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,820
Jing Yuan is saved

130
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,330
Jing Yuan saved Lin'er

131
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:48,504
The doctor is here

132
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,158
Quickly

133
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:50,652
fifth elder brother

134
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,702
This herb is Xuan Hu, right?

135
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,552
Lord Jing is saved

136
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:57,223
Very good

137
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:58,723
Go and make some medicine

138
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,645
Go, go, go

139
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:01,761
Very good

140
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:05,142
Lin'er Lin'er

141
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:05,843
Imperial physician

142
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:06,514
Lin'er

143
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:07,836
Imperial physician

144
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,306
Come and show Lin'er

145
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,052
Bring some hemostatic medicine to the imperial doctor.

146
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,033
Lin'er

147
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,233
Lin'er

148
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,258
Not allowed

149
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,782
Lin'er Lin'er

150
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,342
You are not allowed to die Lin'er

151
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:20,643
Lin'er, what did you say?

152
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:21,733
I can't hear clearly

153
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,227
You are not allowed to die

154
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:26,252
she said

155
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:27,827
I won't let you die

156
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,299
Lin'er

157
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,791
you can't die

158
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,230
You don't want to die

159
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:55,694
I don't want you to die

160
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,208
You don't want to die

161
00:09:57,676 --> 00:09:58,676
Jingyuan

162
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,952
Jingyuan Jingyuan

163
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:02,520
Lin'er Jingyuan

164
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:04,842
Lin'er, you're awake

165
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:05,994
little swallow

166
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,267
Where is Jing Yuan?

167
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,347
Jing Yuan is fine

168
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,014
He ate the herbs you found

169
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,186
The imperial doctor said

170
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,086
His pulse is stable now

171
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,433
No more fever

172
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,002
This means he is saved

173
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:18,275
Really

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,892
Um

175
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:22,909
that's great

176
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,695
Very good

177
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:56,286
Jingyuan

178
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:02,725
I tried

179
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,392
I can't live without you

180
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,654
As long as you can survive

181
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,411
I don't care

182
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,983
I can't go back

183
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:33,742
Jingyuan

184
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:34,910
Jingyuan, are you awake?

185
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:36,927
you woke up

186
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,133
who are you
