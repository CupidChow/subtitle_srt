=My Fairy Doctor=
=Episode 15=

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,320
I'm not just here,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,640
I live here.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,720
Qi.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,360
Qi.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,720
Mr. Tang.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,000
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,880
I came to see you.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,760
After you left this clinic
three years ago,

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
you are no longer my disciple

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
and I am no longer your mentor.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,840
You're not welcome here.

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,400
Father, Nianzhou means well.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,480
She's right.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,000
He came all the way here.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Why don't you let him stay for dinner?

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Mr. Tang.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,520
I know

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920
I did wrong back then.

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,240
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,600
I just wanted to come

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,480
and see you.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,440
Father.

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,680
He is sincere.

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Just give him another chance.

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,880
You must have

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,280
something up your sleeve.

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
Stay out of this.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,320
Let's eat.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Qi.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
I remember you used to like roast pork.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,040
Eat more.

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Thank you.

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,560
Your skin is bad lately.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,440
You need to cut out meat

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,760
and eat more vegetables

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
for a balanced diet.

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,440
Well,

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,880
she only likes potatoes.

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,400
Asparagus has many benefits.

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
It is good for you.

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,400
Green vegetables are important.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,600
Leeks are good for
promoting blood circulation.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Enoki mushroom.

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,520
Coarse grains.

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,600
Chicken.

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,760
Asparagus.

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,280
Fish.

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,800
Meatballs.

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,160
Potatoes.

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Cabbage.

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,240
Green vegetables.

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,480
Enough!

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,000
This is too much.

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,040
Eat up.

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,280
By the way,

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,440
I've recently heard from herbalists

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
that the demand for herbs

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
exceeds the supply,

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
causing prices to rise rapidly.

61
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,480
I can help if you need anything.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,520
Thank you for your concern,

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
but the clinic is doing fine.

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
Badou and I have been
live-streaming for the clinic.

65
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,440
We have fans all over the world.

66
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,440
The future of the clinic is bright.

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
Qizi.

68
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,720
The power of love.

69
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,320
Shut up.

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,720
Uncle.

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
It's been a long time
since we've had a game.

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's play chess tonight.

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
Play chess?

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
What chess?

75
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,400
The advantage of staying here

76
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,320
is that not only can I
ask you for medical advice,

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
but also enjoy leisure time with you.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Qi.

79
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,440
Remember when everyone used to fight for

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
the tomato and squash soup
your mother made for you?

81
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
It tasted better because of that.

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,840
I really miss the old days.

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
Unfortunately,

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
your mother...

85
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
Don't talk while eating.

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,120
(National Medical Centre)
You, me, and Badou

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,480
will split the earnings
on a 30,40,30,basis.

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,920
You have 10 days left
to pay off your debt.

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,600
You're about to clear your debt.

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,800
Why are you unhappy?

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,400
I have talents and looks.

92
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,360
I'm rich

93
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,440
and loyal.

94
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,800
Still, why do you like
that funny-looking guy?

95
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,200
You are prejudiced against him.

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you think you are

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,600
not as good as others in medicine,

98
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
so you...

99
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,560
Although I don't know him,

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm the Divine Physician.

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,240
Why would I be intimidated
by such a petty herbalist?

102
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,320
I just like him.

103
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,520
He is better than you.

104
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
Anyway, he is the best.

105
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
Everything about him is the best!

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,400
Tang Caichen.

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
Don't think I'm yours just because

108
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,840
we sleep in the same room.

109
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,520
I hate you.

110
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
Keep your distance from me.

111
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,440
Nianzhou, are you busy?

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Hello.

113
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,000
Are you looking for Nianzhou?

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,320
Who are you?

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm his girlfriend.
