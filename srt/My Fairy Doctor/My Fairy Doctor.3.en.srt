2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,240
The two people connected by the red string

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
will form a barrier within
one foot of each other.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,200
We will be bounced back

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,120
if we are out of range.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,120
(How am I going to see Nianzhou tomorrow)

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,360
(if I'm stuck with him?)

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,640
Tang.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,760
Come out!

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,040
You quack.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,200
Show yourself.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,480
Mr. Zhang.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,320
What's wrong?

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,520
Dr. Tang.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,880
I've eaten a ton of pig's heart.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
My burps and farts

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,280
even smell like it.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,800
Still, at night,

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,080
I have nightmares

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,160
and sweat a lot.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,520
My wife agrees that there is

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
something wrong with me.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,520
I've been treated

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,080
by you for so long.

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,040
Tell me.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,720
What exactly is my illness?

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,880
Mr. Zhang.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
There are many

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,320
different kinds of illnesses.

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,520
Not all of them can be cured.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,440
The medical saint,
Zhang Zhongjing, once said

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,040
the pulse and symptoms

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,280
will tell about your health.

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,320
Treating the symptoms accordingly

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,960
is a way of identifying them.

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,680
What's more, you have weak kidneys.

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,840
It's a chronic disease

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,760
that requires a long
course of treatment.

39
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,800
You have to be patient.

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,960
Who said I have weak kidneys?

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,000
My kidneys are fine!

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,840
Tang.

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Listen!

44
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,240
I'm not easy to fool!

45
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,240
Mr. Zhang, what...

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,120
Give me my money back.

47
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,680
Otherwise,

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,840
I will

49
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,640
smash this place up!

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,480
Stagnation of Qi

51
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,640
and blood stasis.

52
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,000
Emotional disturbances

53
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
can develop a negative impact on the liver.

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
Who exactly are you?

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Who will believe you?

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
You often have

57
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
symptoms of weak erection

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,240
during intercourse.

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
I have a remedy

60
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,840
to keep your sexual life

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
and kidneys healthy.

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,320
What remedy?

63
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,760
Follow this prescription

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,800
and get three sets of medicine.

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,160
If you still don't see any results,

66
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,040
you come here again

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,680
and name the price of compensation.

68
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,040
Go and get the herbs.

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Fine.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
You said so yourself.

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,960
I didn't blackmail you.

72
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,160
Yes.

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,320
He can name the price?

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,840
What if he asks for more?

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
It is the physician's duty

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,400
to heal and save lives.

77
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,480
If you don't have
that kind of confidence,

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
you're not qualified to be a physician.

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
Are you really a physician?

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm the Divine Physician.

81
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Fine.

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,800
Divine Physician.

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
Can you write the prescription again

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,720
for me?

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
I'll take a picture
and send it to my father.

86
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,360
I don't want to make any more trouble.

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,040
You should say,

88
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
"Divine Physician,

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
could you please teach me
the prescription you made earlier?"

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
You're not qualified to

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
study medicine from me.

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,720
Chinese medicine is all
about herb-herb interaction.

93
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,680
One herb may alter
the effect of the other.

94
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,720
It should not be used indiscriminately.

95
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
You prescribed him pig's heart

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
without any other medicine.

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
No wonder the effect is slow.

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
There's no harm anyway.

99
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
Suit yourself.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,880
♪Light up all the stars♪

101
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,320
♪Wish for staying with you forever♪

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,000

104
