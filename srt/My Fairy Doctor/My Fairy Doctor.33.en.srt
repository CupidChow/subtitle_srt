2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,880
To the bridal bedroom.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,800
Wait.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,680
My daughter

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,440
is now a big girl

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,920
and is getting married.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,440
I know

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
you've been

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,520
resenting me all these years
for the incident of your mother.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,600
Your mother had
an unknown serious illness.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,120
She didn't want to die in the hospital.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,360
I had no choice but to bring her home.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,480
I had tried

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,160
everything I could,

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,120
but

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,440
I still couldn't cure her.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,760
I didn't tell you

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
because you were still young.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
Later,

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,080
I never found
the right opportunity to tell you.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,520
Father.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm sorry

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,240
for misunderstanding you.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,880
Okay.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Enough about that.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
This is the dowry

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,320
your mother left for you.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
There are also some

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,880
that I have saved
for you over the years.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
When

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,560
your mother was on her deathbed,

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,920
she asked me not to let you work.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,600
She just hoped

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
that you would grow up

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,400
safe and sound.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,040
Time flies

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,120
and now you're getting married.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,080
Father.

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
Father.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,600
Qinjian doesn't have much time left.

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
We'll have plenty
of time to talk after this.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay.

43
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,440
To the bridal bedroom.

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,200
We have become one.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
Never doubt our love.

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,760
The night is still young.

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,480
Let's seize the moment.

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
When I first appeared,

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,840
were you scared?

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,280
I was terrified.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
By the next night,

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,120
I was still too scared to sleep.

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,080
I adapted to your life very quickly.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
But I seem

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
more scared now

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
than I was then.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,200
It's okay.

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
If I leave,

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,480
you can think of everything as a dream.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
From the moment I appeared

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,880
to the moment I would disappear,

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,640
think of it

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,440
as a beautiful dream.

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,200
That way you'll feel less sad.

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,080
Okay.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,200
I'll think of it as

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
a beautiful

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,200
and wonderful

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
dream.
