The jade pendant.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,360
He wanted to show that

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
he had more money than Nianzhou.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,440
Are you out of your mind?

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,680
How could you pawn the jade pendant?

Don't do such a stupid thing again.

14

I just want to make you happy.

I understand.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm happy.

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,280
So

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,200
you're not angry anymore?

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,520
I wasn't angry in the first place.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,800
I see.

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
You're very tolerant

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,880
So annoying.

all these crowds?

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,680
No idea.

35
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,680
We've never had so many visitors before.

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,440
The handsome guy is here.

37

What's going on here?

41
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,400
The fans are so enthusiastic.

42
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,280
They saw the shipping address

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
and came to us.

Never pass up
an opportunity to earn money.

51
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,600
I learn this from you.

52
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
Why don't you do it yourself?

53
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm not good-looking enough.

54
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,480
Modern people are open-minded.

55
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,920
You must dedicate
yourself to the clinic.

56
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,360
Don't you get jealous

57

seeing him like that?

58
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
I don't care.

59
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,920
Why did you even kiss him?

60
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,240
Tang Caichen, come back and eat!

61
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,560
Why?

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,520
The fans are so excited now.

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you dumb?

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
Think about it. If they ruined him,

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,720
who will go live with you?

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
Hurry up.

How am I doing today?

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
I was holding back my discomfort.

71
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,160
I followed your instructions.

72
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
Money comes first.

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,600
Didn't you like it?

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,120
I saw how much you enjoyed it.

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
I did all that

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,920
for you and the clinic.

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,880
Well done then.

Blackout again.

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,360
I haven't washed up yet.

80
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
It's uncomfortable to sleep like this.

81
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,480
It's fine.

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,120
I won't complain.

83
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,280
It's not the first day
we've slept together.

84
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
All right.

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,760
But...

86
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,760
But what?

87
