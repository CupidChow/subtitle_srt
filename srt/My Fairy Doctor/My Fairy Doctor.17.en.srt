2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello, fans.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
This concludes our
live broadcast today.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,840
See you next time.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,760
I have something important
to discuss with Badou.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,040
Please excuse yourself.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,680
Badou.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,680
Come with me.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,680
Why?

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,960
No idea.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes?

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,200
Who is better, me or Wen Nianzhou?

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,840
What?

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,480
Keep it down.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,000
In terms of looks,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,640
Caichen is more handsome.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,200
But you know,

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,480
money is the only appeal

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,800
in this society nowadays.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,640
You are

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,960
a good asset at best.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
First, you have to settle
your debt with my sister.

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,520
Nianzhou is different.

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
He is a perfect elite.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,480
Qizi is angry at me.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,200
Do you have any good advice?

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,880
You asked the right person.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,600
There are only three ways
to make a girl happy.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,800
Give her money,

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,440
money

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,240
and

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:19,960
money.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,880
I don't think

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,880
Qizi is a materialistic person.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
You don't know her.

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm her brother. I know her well.

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,880
Okay.

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,480
Do me a favour then.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
Pawn this

40
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,800
jade pendant for me.

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,320
Is this thing genuine?

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,880
Is it valuable?

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
It should be.

44
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,920
Caichen.

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,600
I mean,

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,600
brother-in-law.

47
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,960
Do you really like my sister?

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,600
Your sister?

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,800
That's impossible.

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,280
No way.

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,560
No.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:53,800
Never.

53
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,360
I won't like her.

54
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,720
You are doomed.

55
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,320
You've fallen in love.

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,760
Poor you.

57
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
Poor you.

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,440
Nonsense.

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Let's go.

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,160
Congratulations.

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,760
I've done the math.

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,520
You'll soon settle your debt.

63
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
That's for sure.

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Now, should we talk about us?

65
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,080
Here you go again.

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,120
I don't like you

67
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
and I won't marry you.

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
We need to find a way

69
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
to break the spell.

70
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,400
Is it because of Wen Nianzhou?

71
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,040
This has nothing to do with him.

72
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,800
Qizi.

73
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,640
Badou.

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,200
You...

75
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,840
Are you in trouble with gangsters?

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,240
Nonsense.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,720
Listen.

78
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Gentlemen, please spare him.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Please.

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
My brother is young and ignorant.

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Please forgive him.

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Hey.

83
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,800
What are you doing?

84
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,640
Thank you.

85
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,960
Badou.

86
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
Did you rob the bank?

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Tang Qizi, don't be
prejudiced against me.

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
I was just doing an errand
for my brother-in-law.

89
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,600
He is rich.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
He pawned the imperial tribute.

91
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,160
It's worth RMB800,000.

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Qizi.

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
Give a tenth of the money to Badou.

94
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,120
You keep the rest.

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
Thank you, brother-in-law.

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,640
What did you pawn?

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
The jade pendant.

98
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,400
♪Light up all the stars♪

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,520
