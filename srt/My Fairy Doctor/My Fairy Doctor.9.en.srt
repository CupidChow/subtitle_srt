2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
So troublesome.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,040
Come with me.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,600
Look.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
This is hand soap.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,720
Press it into your palm like this.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,120
Then turn on the tap

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,560
and wet your hands.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,080
Keep rubbing

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,840
until there are bubbles.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,040
Turn on the tap again

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,080
and rinse your hands.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,920
Done.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
What are you doing?

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,560
Stop. That's disgusting.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,000
This toilet paper is clean and soft.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,560
The toilet is also slightly luxurious
than the one in the palace.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,200
I didn't expect you

19

to be wealthy.

Come on.

Do not open your eyes until I leave.

58

Hurry up.

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,960
No.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,480
This is against

61
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,040
the etiquette.

62

I abruptly said you were my girlfriend.

70
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,560
I should be the one apologizing.

Are you free tomorrow?

72

I may be a little busy
at the clinic tomorrow.

74

I had booked two movie tickets.

I heard a man's voice.

76

I'm watching television.

77

Coming.

78

I see.

82

All right then.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
Rest early.

84

Okay, I'll think about it.
