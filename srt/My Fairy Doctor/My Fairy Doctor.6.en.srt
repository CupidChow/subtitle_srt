2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,440
When did you learn to ride a bike?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,240
You taught me.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Be careful.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,880
Watch out!

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,760
Turn right.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,040
Be careful.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,480
Watch out for the crowd.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,680
Out of the way! Don't crash into them!

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,520
- Sorry.
- Do you know how to ride a bike?

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,120
Ride forward.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,880
Sorry.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,240
Brake!

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,880
- Hey, pull the brake.
- Pay more attention.

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,440
Turn right.

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,400
Now!

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,960
Don't ride if you don't know how to.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,240
My bike.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,360
What should we do now?

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,440
Your donkey is sick.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,880
You can go to the vet.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm treating people,

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,160
not animals.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,040
You're talking nonsense.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
Come and help me.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,760
Okay.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,400
Qizi.

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,040
I hate this.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,080
Qizi!

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,880
Qi.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,680
Father.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,440
Didn't you guys go
out of town for herbs?

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,840
Why are you back so early?

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,760
I don't feel at ease

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,160
leaving the clinic with you.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,920
What if there is a patient?

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,040
I can treat patients.

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,280
You still haven't
reflected on yourself, have you?

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,000
Last time,

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,760
you treated gastrointestinal disease
as a liver failure.

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,480
I was...

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
You are the eldest daughter.

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,240
You have to take responsibility.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,680
When you are of age,

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,440
find a local

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,600
and get married.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Don't keep thinking of going
abroad with Wen Nianzhou.

48
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,320
What can you do there?

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,080
Father!

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,000
I have my own plan.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Does everyone have to stay with you?

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,360
You always...

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,480
Enough.

54
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
Stop arguing.

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,120
Qizi.

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,440
Anger makes you age more.

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,680
Father is trying to do
what's best for the clinic.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,640
You see, we just came back
from grocery shopping.

59
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,160
Shall we eat hot pot today?

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,920
I also bought you stinky tofu.

61
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,520
Stinky tofu?

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,320
Is this from Wang's restaurant?

63
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,400
You bought a lot.

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Are you...

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
Qizi's boyfriend?

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,360
Father.

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,160
Don't talk nonsense.

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
He's not my boyfriend.

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,080
Don't be shy.

70
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,880
Father.

71
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,160
Young man.

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,920
Would you like to have
dinner together with us?

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
I gladly accept

74
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,760
your invitation.

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,720
Great.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Let's go then.

77
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
After you.

78
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,680
Doudou, handle the bike.

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Father.

80
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,800
Come on.

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,120
Qizi, is your bike broken?

82
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,720
Yes.

83
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
What have you done?

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
You didn't hesitate at all.

85
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,840
Remember.

86
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't talk nonsense,

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,000
or I'll tear up your painting

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
and make you disappear forever.

89
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm starving.

90
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Young man.

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,720
Eat this.

92
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,480
Where do you live?

93
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,600
I have several residences in Shendu.

94
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,920
I also have a dozen more properties

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
in Yancheng, Tongchuan and Xian'an.

96
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,120
Three houses are for permanent
residence and visiting the court,

97
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,000
three summer houses,

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,120
two winter houses

99
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
four for meeting friends,

100
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,640
and the other four are used for storage.

101
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,160
What do you do for a living?

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,640
I was a physician
appointed by the Emperor

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,680
in Tang Dynasty.

104
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,120

♪Light up all the stars♪

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,320
