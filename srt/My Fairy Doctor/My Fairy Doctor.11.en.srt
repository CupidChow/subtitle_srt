2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,320
You should have
something of value on you

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,880
from the Tang Dynasty.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,240
I'm really penniless at the moment.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,320
Do not worry.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,760
I will make money to pay you back.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
After that,

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,440
if you still don't agree to be my wife,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,880
I'll return to the painting.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,320
What do you say?

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,600
You must have
planned all this, didn't you?

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,440
(She is now bent on cutting ties with me.)

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,200
(If she becomes my debtor,)

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,360

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,420
(I owe Tang Qizi 24,500RMB, Physician Tang)

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,980
(I owe Tang Qizi 24,500RMB, Physician Tang)

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,520
From now on,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,480
you have to work to pay your debts.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,080
Work?

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,360
Think carefully.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,480
What are you good at?

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,160
Music, chess, calligraphy, painting,

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,240
archery, calligraphy and mathematics.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Everything.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,800
These are useless skills.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,840
Nowadays, only the rich do art.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,400
I have an idea.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,440
(Tang's makeup)
Folks,

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,840
RMB35 for a classical make-up look.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,000
Bring back the Tang Dynasty's style

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
for only 35RMB.

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
Don't miss out

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,520
this chance.

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,320
Don't miss out

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,040
this chance.

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,280
My hands

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,800
have healed countless royalty

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,840
and I could make a fortune in a day.

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
My paintings were even more valuable.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,160
But now,

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,920
you asked me to do someone's make-up

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,000
with my precious hands.

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,200
I can't do this.

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,940
(Tang's makeup, take you on
a journey through the Tang Dynasty.)

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,160
How about your debt?

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
24,500RMB.

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Pay me back.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,880
Or

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,400
are you actually not confident

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,880
with your skills?

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,760
What a joke.

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
With my skills, I can get

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,280
a lot of customers.

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,920
That's great!

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,680
Free make-up for
the first five customers.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,520
Free make-up for
the first five customers.

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
You're humiliating me.

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
You don't understand the modern mind.

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,120
A cheap one is better than a good one.

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,480
A free one is better than a cheap one.

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
This is marketing.

62
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,160
The first five are free, right?

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,160
Yes.

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
I've been watching you.

65
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,040
I'm your first customer.

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Do you have any requirements?

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,920
Not really.

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,800
Just make sure I look pretty.

69
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,000
Look at your face shape,

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
your skin

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
and complexion.

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
I just thought this young man

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
is quite handsome

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,840
and wanted to get to know him.

75
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
No matter how you look,

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,480
our make-up artist can make you

77
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,440
look stunning.

78
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Am I right?

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
You can doubt your face,

80
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
but please trust my skills.

81
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,480
What?

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
Is this me?

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,920
You look so pretty!

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,720
Thanks.

85
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,880
Thank you so much.

86

You're welcome.

Please come again.

88

Sure.

89

Bye.

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
Good job.

91
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,840
The first five are free.

92
