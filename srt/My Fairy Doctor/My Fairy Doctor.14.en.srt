2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,360
It actually tastes good.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,400
- I put...
- Why are you talking to yourself?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,280
Nothing.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,440
I want to take a shower.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,200
Please excuse yourself.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,840
You always take showers.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,040
Are you that hygienic?

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,520
Do you want to join me?

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,200
I will never take a shower with you.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,240
Freak.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,860
(Alleged violation. System under review.)

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
It's still streaming.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
What are you doing?

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,360
I...

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,760
Nothing.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,360
This pyjama is too small for me.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,400
Not at all.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,000
It fits you perfectly.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,600
What are you doing?

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,720
People on TV do that.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't learn all that nonsense.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,120
You are banned from watching TV.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,160
Isn't that what

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,320
they do on TV?

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Caichen.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,120
Let's go live.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,400
You can't waste your

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
good-looking face, can you?

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,120
I will not sell my looks

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,640
and make a fool of myself.

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,080
Unless

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
your sister begs me.

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,760
Hold on.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
No way.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
How about this?

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
How did you get this picture?

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,480
Tang Badou.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,760
What do you want?

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll keep your secret

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,680
if you beg Caishen to go live.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
Or I'll tell father

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,040
that you two...

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,800
Hey!

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,640
Tang Caichen.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
You're now part of the clinic.

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,840
Live streaming can be a great way
to educate fans about medical science

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,080
and promote our clinic.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,560
It's killing two birds with one stone.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,480
Beg me.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Sure.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
I beg you.

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,320
Well,

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,880
no choice then.

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Qi.

56

Qi.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,360
Nianzhou.

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,480
What brings you here?

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,440
I just wanted to see you.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,000
This is for you.

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,240
Thank you.

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,560
This is for Badou and your father.

63
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,040
Thank you.

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Excuse me.

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,440
What are you doing?

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,520
Such a nasty person

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,120
should be thrown out.

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,280
Qi.

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,320
Who is this?

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
Do you want me to splash you again

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
to make you remember?

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,440
Shut up.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,600
What are you doing here?

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm not just here,

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,120
I live here.
