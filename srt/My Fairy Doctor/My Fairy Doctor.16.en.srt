2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,240
Nianzhou.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,200
Are you busy?

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,640
Are you looking for Nianzhou?

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,680
He went to shower.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,720
Who are you?

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm his girlfriend.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,840
Hold on.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,280
Zhouzhou, you have a call.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,360
Zhou.

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,360
Never mind.

12
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,080
Tell Nianzhou...

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,000
Please tell Dr. Wen

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
that it's nothing.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,360
Don't leave me.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,400
What's wrong?

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,600
Mother.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,840
It's okay.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,720
Mother.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,680
Don't leave me.

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,160
Wear this.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,040
Don't leave me.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,960
I won't leave.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
It's okay.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm here.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,640
Coward.

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,320
Don't be afraid.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
I'm here.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
Is it because I've been
staying up late lately?

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,480
Why are my hands wrinkled?

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
Do you have grooming tools?

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Sit down.

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,720
Are you still angry?

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,560
No.

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,320
Who's angry?

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm very busy.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Do it yourself.

38
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,120
Lili.

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,720
How do you feel?

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,960
Much better.

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,920
Father.

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,360
I want to go out for a walk.

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,080
Why are you so eager

44
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,000
to get out?

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,600
(Liu Lili)
Father.

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,360
I recently saw
a broadcaster on the Internet.

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
He seems to be in this town, too.

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
I want to see him.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,840
My daughter.

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,360
(Liu Tianming)
Be patient.

51
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
You can do whatever you want

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,760
when you get better.

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Dr. Wen.

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,480
You've been my daughter's
attending doctor

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,640
for over a year now.

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,040
My daughter's condition

57
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,600
has been recurring.

58
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,080
Are you sure

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,320
about this one?

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,480
Mr. Liu.

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Lili has one last session to recover.

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,440
Good.

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
As expected of

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,240
a top student from abroad.

65
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
I've read

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
your previous proposal
for the remodelling of

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,280
the National Medical Centre.

68
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
If Lili makes a full recovery

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,360
like you said,

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,880
I'll fund you

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,680
to run a hospital.

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
You can't afford to slack off

73
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
at this crucial stage.

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,760
Mr. Liu, rest assured.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,080
I am very confident

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
about this medical plan.
