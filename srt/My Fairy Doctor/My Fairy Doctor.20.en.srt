00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,120
Snake!

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,200
Where?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,560
Would you like to have a look?

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm not interested.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,720
Let's go.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,560
Good for both of you.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
You guys get to
have fun in the mountain,

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,680
while I'm here alone.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,360
What's the point of staying here?

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,400
There are no customers anyway.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,320
Badou.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,200
Nianzhou.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,080
Where is your sister?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,400
Here.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,320
When did they

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,040
become so close?

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,880
That's only natural.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,360
They stick together every day.

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,160
They are

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,040
inseparable.

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,840
They just

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,760
didn't sleep together.

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
What are they doing there?

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,640
They went up the mountain

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,840
to find...

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,520
Badou.

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,240
Badou.

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,520
Dry the herbs.

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,640
Mr. Tang.

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,880
What are you doing here again?

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,160
I just want to know

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,880
if there is anything I can do to help.

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
No need.

35
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,280
We have Tang to help with the clinic.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,760
Everything will be fine.

37
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,640
Selling medicines online is a good idea,

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,640
but it's not a long-term solution.

39
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
I asked my boss for help.

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
He can get
an interest-free loan for the clinic.

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,240
No need.

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,120
I'll go to the bank for a loan.

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,360
I appreciate

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
your kindness.

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
How about this?

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,680
I put the contract here.

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,920
(Xincheng Group Loan and Security Contract)
If you need anything,

48
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,680
call me anytime.

49
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm leaving first, Mr. Tang.

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,740
(Xincheng Group Loan and Security Contract)

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,960
There are no more snakes.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,560
Put me down.

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,320
Put me down.

54
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Let's go there

55
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,360
and enjoy the nice scenery.

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,440
We're not here to have fun,

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,320
but to break the spell.

58
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Hurry up.

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,840
Fine.

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,320
What's wrong?

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,680
Are you okay?

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,080
My leg.

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Did you sprain your leg?

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,600
Take a rest over there.

65
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,280
Does it really hurt?

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,960
Sit there.

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Let me see.

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,840
Slowly.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
Here?

70
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,400
Yes.

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,920
On the left.

72
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
Okay.

73
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
On the right.

74
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,120
This is the same spot as before.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,720
On the right.

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,040
A little further down.

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,480
To the left.

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Where is it?

79
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,080
A little further down.

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,680
But

81
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,240
left...

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Stop pretending.

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,040
I won't buy it.

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,080
Do you think this is funny?

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,920
Don't be angry, okay?

87
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,840
Rest for a while.

88
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,840
Whatever.

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,640
Do you have any plans

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
after breaking the spell?

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
I have a lot of plans.

92
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
I want to further my studies,

93
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,680
go to the playground

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
and travel around the world.

95
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
I can go wherever I want

96
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,640
without a tag-along.

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,120
Then I'm not part of

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,880
your plan.

99
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,480
Why should I?

100
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,080
Qizi.
