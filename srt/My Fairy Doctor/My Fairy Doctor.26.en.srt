2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,360
Okay, I'll go right over.

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:32,960
Qizi.

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,320
Be my girlfriend.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,440
Let's study abroad together.

6
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,960
Nianzhou.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,560
I've decided to stay in town.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,080
Why?

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
Is your father stopping you?

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,640
No.

11
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,440
I thought about it.

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,280
I think the townsfolk

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,840
need a responsible

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,080
and tolerant doctor

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,560
rather than a skilled one.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,360
My father is getting older.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,160
I want to commit myself to the clinic.

18
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,760
What about us?

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,320
Qizi.

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,960
I'm true to you.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,840
I can feel

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,960
if it's true or not.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,800
What do you mean?

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,040
Don't you know I've
been allergic to pollen

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
since I was a kid?

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
Or do you just not care?

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,160
Qizi, I really...

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,880
Enough.

29
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,160
It's late. I have to go.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,720
Is it because of Tang Qinjian?

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,960
No.

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,720
He is your ancestor!

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,800
You can't be together!

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
Let me go.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,800
You're hurting me.

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,000
Sorry, Qizi.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,720
Listen.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,480
The clinic is not making ends meet.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Your father will only pass it
down to your brother.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
You won't gain anything.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,640
Stay out of our family's business.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Qizi.

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,080
Tang Qizi.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
You drove me to it.

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Jiang.

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,000
We've been working
together for so many years.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,040
You have to keep your word.

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
How can you suddenly stop

49
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
supplying herbs?

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tang.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,320
Let me be frank with you.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
A major pharmaceutical company

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,800
has purchased all the herbs you need.

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,320
They even paid

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,960
15% more than the original price.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,920
We can talk business

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,440
if you're willing to pay more.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,640
That's it.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Wait.

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
I don't know how to put this.

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,040
I will definitely pay you back

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,520
in less than a month.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't worry.

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Why can't this loan be approved?

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,520
We have checked

66
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
that your clinic does not have
the capacity to repay the loan.

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,920
We cannot take the risk.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,080
I asked my boss for help.

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,160
He can get
an interest-free loan for the clinic.

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,640
I put the contract here.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,080
(Xincheng Group Loan and Security Contract)
If you need anything,

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
call me anytime.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Bank loans are always an added bonus,

74
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,360
not a relief.

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,640
It's not surprising that
the bank won't approve it

76
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,440
in a case like ours.

77
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,520
Indeed.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Nianzhou.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,320
I've signed

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,880
the contract.

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,040
I will

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
courier it to you.

83
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,880
Please send my gratitude to your boss.

84
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,640
I appreciate your help, too.

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't mention it.

86
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,800
I also want to help the clinic

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,840
get through this difficult time.

88
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,200
Nianzhou.

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm sorry

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,120
for misjudging you before.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
Anyway,

92
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
you are still my mentor.
