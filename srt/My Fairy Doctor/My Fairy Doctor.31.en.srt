2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Mr. Liu.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:05,960
I can explain.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,640
Enough.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,600
I can wait for half a year

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,240
as long as Lili can be cured.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Also,

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
the herbs must be

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,720
boiled to perfection.

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,000
It must be supervised
by a pharmacologist.

11
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
I think

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Ms. Tang Qizi should be

13
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,320
in charge of this.

14
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,760
Naturally,

15
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,560
the medication charge

16
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,800
is not cheap.

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,200
Just name the price.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
Previously, I charged the imperial...

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
Based on the price of my
previous consultations,

20
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,360
one session

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,680
would cost about 700 liang of silver,

22
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,000
plus the cost of herbs,

23
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,400
which amounts to 2.4 million.

24
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,440
Let me ask you.

25
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,880
How much does the clinic owe you?

26
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,920
Two million whole.

27
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,920
Perfect.

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,120
That is worth one year of treatment.

29
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
You should be able to afford it.

30
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,480
Of course.

31
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,520
Money is not a problem.

32
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,160
Well then,

33
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,840
we have other patients waiting.

34
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,920
So we'll take our leave.

35
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,640
Okay.

36
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,840
Goodbye.

37
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,520
Liu... Mr. Liu.

38
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
Qi.

39
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,280
Qi.

40
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,200
Let's talk.

41
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
What now?

42
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Qizi.

43
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,560
I did all this because of you.

44
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,040
We were childhood
friends for so many years.

45
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,240
I couldn't bear to see you
with someone else.

46
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm just a pawn for you.

47
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,360
You are trying to use me
to acquire the clinic

48
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,640
and fulfil your greed.

49
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,120
No.

50
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,560
Qizi, I...

51
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,440
Stop lying.

52
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,760
I should have been more alert

53
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
when Caichen first advised me.

54
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,320
Tang Qizi.

55
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,440
Don't forget.

56
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,960
He is your ancestor.

57
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,200
I haven't settled the score with you

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,280
about the forgery of the treatise.

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
Here's a little advice for you.

60
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Calamity will befall those

61
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
who are lacking in virtue.

62
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,640
Be careful.

63
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,040
Let's go.

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
So you really aren't my ancestor?

65
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Of course.

66
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,440
It all came back to me

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
after I returned to the painting.

68
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,360
I moved into Tang's residence

69
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
with my adoptive father

70
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,080
and was later accepted

71
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,120
to be part of the Tang family

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
after becoming an official.

73
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,720
As for the portrait,

74
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,760
I think it was painted by

75
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
the Tang family's painter later on.

76
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
But I have to say,

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,960
the portrait really doesn't
look anything like you.

78
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,240
Is that so?

79
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,200
Yes.

80
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,880
If you were not originally
from the Tang family,

81
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,120
then where were you from?

82
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
My family name is Song.

83
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,760
Song Qinjian?

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,440
Yes.

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
Song Qinjian?
[*send an invitation]

86
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,640
Song Qinjian.

87
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,360
What's so funny?

88
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
I just think

89
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
your name is quite

90
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,320
interesting.

91
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,880
Although I am not your ancestor,

92
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm still your senior.

93
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
So, please

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,880
show some respect.

95
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,080
Yes,

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,400
senior.

97
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,360
This time

98
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,000
Tang deserves the most credit

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,000
for what happened to our clinic.

100
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,280
I have only myself

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,760
to blame.

102
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Father, don't say that.

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
Anyway,

104
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,880
let's celebrate the comeback
of our clinic.

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,280
Father is right.

106
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,200
Caichen deserves the biggest credit.

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,320
Here's to you.

108
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Cheers.

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
Qi.

110
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
I have decided that

111
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,280
from tomorrow onwards,

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,320
you and I will take turns
to sit in the clinic.

113
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
Tomorrow you go first.

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
Sure.

115
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,720
Tomorrow,

116
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,160
Qizi would probably not be free.

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,200
To be honest,

118
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
I only have 12 days left.

119
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,280
So,

120
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
for the rest of the days,

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,680
I don't want to be separated from Qizi.
