2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,200
30 plus 19.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,360
The total is 527RMB.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,800
After deducting the venue fee
and the equipment...

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,560
When will you be able to
pay off my 24,000RMB?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,480
It's your fault

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,800
for being a spendthrift.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,200
The appearance

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,840
is a symbol of status.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,120
I can't be sloppy.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,760
I finally saved up

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,480
all this money for my overseas trip

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,880
and you spent it all!

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,360
Your clinic is now heavily indebted.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,480
At this rate,

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,440
this place will be closed

17
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,600
in less than six months.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,040
Bite your tongue!

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,360
Listen.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,240
From today onwards,

21
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,480
you will do odd jobs here

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,160
until you pay off your debt.

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
You must show up

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,160
wherever I need you.

25
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,400
I'll help you cover
the losses of your clinic

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,880
and you must promise to marry me.

27
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,040
How about that?

28
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,280
You can't even cover the 24,000RMB.

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,880
How will you help my clinic?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Dr. Tang.

31
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Dr. Tang.

32
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,080
The medicine you prescribed
for me yesterday

33
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,000
really helped.

34
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,040
I've taken a few doses

35
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,960
and it's very effective.

36
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
So

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm here

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
to buy a few more.

39
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,960
It's effective so soon.

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,920
I wasn't

41
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
convinced at first.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,480
So

43
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,360
this morning,

44
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
my wife and I...

45
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,920
Don't tell us the details.

46
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Give me the prescription.

47
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
Remember to take it on time.

48
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,800
Thank you, Dr. Tang.

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Your daughter

50
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,080
is awesome.

51
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,640
Zhang?

52
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,240
Why is Zhang so happy today?

53
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,280
He regained his health.

54
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,160
Of course he is happy.

55
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,280
He's chronically ill.

56
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,840
What kind of medication
did you give him?

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Bring me the prescription.

58
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,520
This prescription may seem bland,

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,720
but it can be used

60
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
to tonify the Yang

61
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,920
and restore the Yin.

62
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
It is not too mild

63
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,440
nor too heavy.

64
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
The formula

65
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
is very precise.

66
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,320
Qi.

67
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,160
You've made progress.

68
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,280
Father.

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,080
It's not me.

70
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,920
It's him.

71
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,680
Tang?

72
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,760
Do you also know traditional
Chinese medicine?

73
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
I know the basics.

74
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,840
Would you like

75
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,000
to help out

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
in our clinic?

77
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
I reckon not.

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,640
You are a rich man after all.

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Say yes.

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Otherwise, I'll have to think
of other excuses to keep you.

81
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,560
Father,

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
he agrees.

83
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,160
Sure.

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,040
Really?

85
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Then

86
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
you can come to work tomorrow.

87
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,000
The starting salary

88
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,080
is not high.

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,200
3,500RMB

90
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
per month.

91
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Great!

92
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,760
Father, you can credit
his salary to my account.

93
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,480
What does it have to do with you?

94
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay.

95
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
I get it.

96
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
You can start tomorrow.

97
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
I'll get going.

98
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,440
Yes!

99
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,320
From now on, I'll get 3,500RMB a month.

100
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,360
In that case,

101
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
you will have seven months

102
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,560
to settle the debt.

103
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,160
I'll give you 70RMB
pocket money every month.

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,680
Spend it wisely.

106
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,960
What is this?

107
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
Television.

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
Television?

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
How can I get to know
your world quickly?

110
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,880
By watching television.

111
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,840
Watching television?

112
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
This is a remote control.

113
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
You don't know this, do you?

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,280
Do you want me to teach you?

115
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
No need.

116
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Do you like this type of man?

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Of course.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,040
Who doesn't love a good-looking man?

119
