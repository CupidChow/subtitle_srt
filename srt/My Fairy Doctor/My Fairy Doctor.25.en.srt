This is for Dr. Tang.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,440
I will pass it to him.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,480
All right. Goodbye.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,440
Goodbye.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,720
I should have

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,840
asked them to send
their birth date to a chat room.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,400
This is tiring.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,320
But then we wouldn't know
if the info was real.

10

Qizi.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,080
Does our ancestor know
that we are looking for

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,160
a wife for him?

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,360
Did he approve this?

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,200
I make the call on this.

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,480
I didn't approve of this.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,240
Pack up now.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,480
I am not going on any blind dates.

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,880
Come with me.

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,160
I need to talk to you.

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you really think I should
study Chinese medicine?

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,960
It takes hard work,

24

to be a doctor.

26
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,200
All three are indispensable.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,280
Although you lack talent,

28
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,160
your hard work and responsibility

29
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,120
are enough to
make up for it.

30

Besides,

31
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,440
I can guide you.

Even if

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,280
you let Dabao attend my classes,

34
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,240
I can teach it medical theory.

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
Then I want to be your best student.

From now on,

feel free to consult

the patients.

41
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,280
Even if they're terminally ill,

42
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,920
I can revive them.

43
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,960

Yes.

It's nice

to feel needed.

Don't get carried away
with a small achievement.

You still have a lot to learn.

Your prescription

55

isn't really impressive.

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,560
It's just acceptable.

You're right.

So

could you

63
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,920
also teach Badou a thing or two?

Qizi

65

is a girl after all.

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,520
If Badou receives your guidance,

67
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,560
he will be able to expand
our family's philosophy of medicine.

68
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Moreover,

69
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,240
Badou is also a bright child.

70

Tang family's medical philosophy

71
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,120
was originally compiled by me.

72

It's up to me

73
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,720
who I pass it on to.

74

Besides,

75
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,640
Badou is not interested in this.

Father.

77

He is right.

I really think Qizi
is fit to be a doctor.

Brat,

is that something you should say
as a son of Tang family?

evaluate yourself
