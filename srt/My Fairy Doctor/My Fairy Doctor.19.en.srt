(National Medical Centre)

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,520
This is immoral

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,280
and indecent.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,720
Tang Qizi.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,520
I can't believe you sleep with a man.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,560
Shut up.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,960
And you.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,160
I know my daughter well.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,880
She is an innocent little girl.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,440
I thought you were a good man.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,000
I was thinking of

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,520
setting you up with her.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,520
I didn't expect you
to do something like this.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
Father.

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,040
We have to sleep together.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,200
How dare you!

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,160
Why can't you sleep apart?

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,480
I think she might be

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
pregnant.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,640
Tang Qizi.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,640
You get pregnant before marriage?

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,600
You can't wait to make me

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,360
a grandfather, can you?

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,560
Then I can be an uncle.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Shut up.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,480
Don't make any wild guesses.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,200
Come with me.

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,160
Where are you going?

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,920
Stop right there.

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,380
(Deceased, Tang Mingwen)

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,440
I was originally in this painting.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
It was Qizi who freed me from it.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,160
So

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,280
we can't be separated

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,360
within a foot of each other.

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,960
You came out of the painting?

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,560
What a fantasy setting.

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,960
Do you have jade

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,520
or something like that on you?

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Wait, father.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,160
Do you really believe
he came out of the painting?

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
Looks like

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,360
it's all true.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,640
When your sister was eight years old,

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,640
she fell seriously ill

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,200
and could not be cured.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,320
Later, someone directed me

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
to seek Master Bo Yi in the mountain.

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,120
The master said

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,600
she is a strong Yin person

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,640
and needs to be suppressed
with Yang energy.

53
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760
So he gave her this bracelet

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
to keep her healthy and safe.

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
He also said

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,960
that this bracelet is
made of exotic stones.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,480
The Yang energy

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,720
was stored in the bracelet.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,080
And the Yin energy

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,800
was stored in another jade.

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,640
When two people meet,

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
they become connected.

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,920
It seems to be

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
the will of God.

65
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Only when Qizi and I

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,720
are married

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,960
can the tie be broken.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,880
So

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,840
you two didn't sleep together, did you?

70
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,600
Father.

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,760
We really didn't do
anything inappropriate.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,720
We are innocent.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Tang.

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
Then I ask you.

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,480
Do you

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
like my daughter?

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,120
We're just connected.

78
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,360
We don't have feelings for each other.

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,360
So he came from a painting.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
If so,

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,600
don't hold my daughter back

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
and don't sully her innocence.

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,080
You should not stay together anymore.

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,800
As for the spell,

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,440
you two go up the mountain tomorrow

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
to find Master Bo Yi.

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,760
He may have a way of untying it.

88
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,320
This may be my last chance.

89
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,120
Should we take a break?

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,320
Snake!

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,400
Where?

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,120
♪Light up all the stars♪

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,560
♪Wish for staying with you forever♪

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,240
♪You're like the thriving Tang dynasty♪

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
♪No matter if we're fated or not♪

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,720
♪We still love each other♪
