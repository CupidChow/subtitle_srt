2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,080
Dr. Tang.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,800
Nianzhou.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,600
Have a seat.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,320
We have known each other for years.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,800
So I'll be straightforward.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,520
You've pledged the clinic to me.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,280
Since you haven't paid on the due date,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,800
the clinic is now owned by my boss

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,280
as per the contract.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,560
I'm here today

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
to notify you to move out.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,760
Nianzhou.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,520
That's not the deal

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,120
when we signed the contract.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,520
Take a good look at the contract.

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,480
If Party A finds that Party B
is not operating the clinic adequately,

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,440
Party A will advance the repayment date

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,480
at any time.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
That contract...

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,080
You deceived me.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,040
You should have seen this coming

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,000
when you kicked me out.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,720
What do you want?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,720
I've gone to great lengths

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,160
just to bring this clinic down.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,320
I want to build a hospital
named after me

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,480
on the same site as this
centuries-old clinic.

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,520
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,320
I knew you were evil.

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,160
I should never have trusted you.

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you doing?

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,240
Stop!

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,120
Stop!

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,880
Stop!

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Stop!

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,800
What are you doing?

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Qizi.

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,480
If we had been together,

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,560
I would have inherited the clinic

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,640
and this situation could
have been avoided.

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,680
Wen Nianzhou.

43
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,800
I didn't expect you to be so wicked.

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
Qinjian said you had bad intentions

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,240
and he was right.

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,160
I shouldn't have liked you.

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,120
Don't mention his name!

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Liu Lili is your boss's daughter, right?

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,720
What would she think of you

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,880
if she knew her attending doctor

51
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,480
was making a scene here?

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm her attending doctor

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,880
and you've only met each other.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
Who do you think

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,360
she'll believe?

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
Today is just a warning.

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,320
I advise you

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
to move out immediately.

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,160
Father.

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,240
Qizi is my friend.

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,720
For my sake,

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
can you postpone the loan
repayment for a few days?

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,320
Besides,

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,320
I think

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,200
there is something amiss in this matter.

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,520
Lili.

67
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
You don't understand

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
business.

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
I have been kind enough

70
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,480
to offer an interest-free loan,

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
but now it seems like

72
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,040
a waste of resources.

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,760
I might as well rebuild it

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
for a better purpose.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,760
Mr. Liu.

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,880
The clinic can't be demolished.

77
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,360
It has a history of hundreds of years

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,400
and carries the efforts of generations
of traditional medicine practitioners.

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,560
That doesn't make it worthwhile.

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
Valueless thing

81
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
should be eliminated.

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
If we can cure Lili,

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
does that justify
the value of the clinic?

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Lili has been ill for many years.

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,560
Dr. Wen has been treating her
for so long and yet no improvement.

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
What makes you think you can cure her?

87
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,880
I've taken Lili's pulse before.

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,440
I think I can give it a try.

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,600
If it doesn't work out,

90
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
we'll move out immediately,

91
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,680
without delay.

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,080
Father.

93
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,520
All right.

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,960
I'll give you a chance.
