2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,000
Does this bracelet

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
have a history?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,720
Nothing special.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,800
It's just what your mother left you.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,640
That's your mother's dowry.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,880
I mean,

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,200
is there

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,600
a legend

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,320
or something?

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,560
Qizi.

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,320
I don't have time

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,200
for your nonsense.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,560
Go back to sleep after you're done.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,400
Okay.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,320
Why didn't you admit
our relationship to your father?

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,400
Because that's not true.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,520
Indeed.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,040
Before a proper marriage,

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,480
a lady should be more reserved.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,840
Since we can't be separated for now,

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,520
you

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,200
take your things

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,800
and go to my room.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,640
A wife should submit to her husband.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
You should be the one who moves here.

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,600
Who says I'm your wife?

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,000
Didn't your father
approve of our marriage?

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,160
Parents have the say

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,400
in their children's marriage

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,360
since ancient times.

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,560
The modern society

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,160
preaches freedom of marriage.

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,080
It is up to the individual,

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,880
okay?

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,360
Who would want to marry

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,360
someone like you?

38
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,080
Fine.

39
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Since I'm marrying you,

40
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,520
I'll comply with you today.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,560
(Tang Dabao)

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,800
Let me introduce you.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,080
This is

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,000
Dabao.

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,920
Dabao.

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
He's Tang Caichen.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
Get along with him.

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
You don't even care.

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,560
If it weren't for Dabao,

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,720
you'd still be in the painting.

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,120
What do

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
we do tonight?

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,520
What else?

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
You sleep on the floor,

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
I sleep in the bed.

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
You want me to sleep on the floor?

57
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,760
Place your bet.

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm a gentleman.

59
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,640
So I bet on the head.

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
Fine,

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,040
you can sleep on the bed if it's head.

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,160
You sleep with Dabao if it's tail.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
Even a dog despises you.

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
Right, Dabao?

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,240
You lose.

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,880
I'll go to bed then.

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,880
I always like to sit on the floor

68
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,000
and sleep on the floor.

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Great then.

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Suit yourself.

71
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,160
Make your own bed.

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
Isn't it the servants' job

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
to make the beds?

74
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,520
Tang Caichen.

75
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,760
Please be clear about
your current situation.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You live in my house

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
and use my stuff.

78
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm the head here.

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,280
I am Dad with the final say.

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,200
Come on.

81
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,320
Call me "Dad".

82
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,680
What does that mean?

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
Dad is the one who provides for you.

84
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,360
That's what I'm doing now.

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,040
You called your father "Dad" just now.

86
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't try to fool me.

87
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Are you hungry?

88
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,000
No.

89
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,320
Hey, Mary.

90
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes?

91
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,320
Launch the food delivery app.

92
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,440
Here you go.

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,280
Who is that?

94
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,840
This is my servant.

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
Didn't you say there are no servants?

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,200
I didn't expect there to be

97
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,880
any cooks at this late hour.

98
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,400
This is my personal chef.

99
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,920
Do you want some?

100
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,440
A gentleman does not
accept pity from others.

101
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
Stop being a hypocrite.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,080
It's my fault

103
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,480
you didn't have a proper dinner.

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm making up for it.

105
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,240
Here you go.

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,840
I want to wash my hands first.
