2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,440
Is this

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,960
really a dream?

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,840
Qizi.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,800
Why are you here?

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,080
Breakfast is ready.

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,960
Come on down.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,800
How come I still only have a few fans?

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,680
How many times have I told you?

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,360
Don't use your phone while eating.

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
Give me another minute.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,840
Qi.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,240
Sit down.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,160
You've lost so much weight recently.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,440
Eat more.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's because you always
punish her to kneel.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,800
He punishes me for my own good.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,720
Tang Qizi, do you hear yourself?

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,280
Qi.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,320
You're not still mad at me

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,880
for not letting you go abroad, are you?

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,440
Of course not.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,840
Father.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,160
I decided to stay in town.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Really?

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
Are you all right?

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,720
Why did you suddenly

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,120
come to your senses?

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,280
Doctors should

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
treat patients equally.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,440
From now on,

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
I want to be a doctor

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
who treats all patients equally.

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
I want to stay in the town

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,640
and help father

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,320
and Badou

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040
to run the clinic

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,120
for the benefit of the community.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,520
Good.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,440
As expected of my sister.

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,360
You are ambitious.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
But let's be clear.

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
I don't want to be involved in this.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,400
I just

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
want to live a carefree life.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,600
Fine.

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
I will provide for you.

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
My sister is the best.

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,440
Eat up.

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
Hello, miss.

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Can you give me directions?

52
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,400
I see you look familiar.

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,960
Hello.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Well,

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
I live nearby.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,440
So we might have met.

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,240
Don't get me wrong.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm from a nearby medical school.

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,480
I heard there is a clinic in town

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
that is specialised in
treating complicated diseases.

62
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,520
I think it's called

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,600
National Medical Centre.

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,680
But I don't know how to get there.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm the doctor there.

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Really?

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
Can I go there and seek advice?

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Of course.

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay.

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,640
It's that way.

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,080
Come with me.

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,880
Okay.

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
What's your name?

74
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,160
Me?

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
My name is Wang Zonghe.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,240
How about you?

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,440
My name is

78
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
Tang Qizi.
