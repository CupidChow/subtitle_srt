2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Thank you.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,960
It is the husband's duty
to protect his wife.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,120
No need to thank me.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,520
Who is your wife?

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
We should find a way to break the spell.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,800
Our connection

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,040
is destined.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,680
You'd better get ready.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,240
In your dreams!

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,920
No way.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,400
Hello.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,720
Good morning, Qizi.

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,080
Good morning, Nianzhou.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,760
I'm in town today on some business.

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,600
Are you at home?

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,560
I'll go to you.

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,600
No, Nianzhou.

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640
I'll go to you instead.

20
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,920
All right then.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,280
I'll see you at our old place.

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Okay.

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,600
What is this?

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,880
Why is it possible to transmit
a voice from miles away?

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,520
This is a mobile phone.

26
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
You don't even know this?

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,360
You are so old-fashioned.

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,360
This is your fault.

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,720
You kept me up all night.

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
You have rough skin,

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,280
chapped lips,

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
poor dressing sense

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,840
and makeup skills.

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
You live a pathetic life

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
as a woman.

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,800
Show me what you can do.

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,960
I don't know your name yet.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,800
My name is Tang Qizi.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,960
I am going to meet
someone very important.

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,440
Since we can't be
separated for the time being,

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
we'll sort it out when
we get back tonight.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,000
Fine.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
You are so unfriendly.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,880

You are really something!

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
I used to paint in the palace.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,920
It was

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,880
during the autumn of Kaiyuan...

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,440
Okay, let's go. I'm getting late.

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,240
Wait.

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,720
Since I'm going out to meet a guest,

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
I have to get changed.

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
No need.

Shouldn't you

65
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,440
prepare a carriage before you go out?

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
There's no such thing.

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,000
Well then,

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
we have to go simple.

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
A donkey or mule will do.

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,000
That's so lame.

71
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,200
I take you on a ride

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,280
on the transport of our time,

73
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,320
"electric donkey".

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Electric donkey?

75
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,200
(Strive for goodness)

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,880
Hop on.

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,560
Here's my donkey.

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
Your donkey

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
looks so weird.

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Well, it does

81
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
sound quite healthy.

Hop on.

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,400
Have you ever ridden a horse?

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,560
Straddle up.

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
Watch and learn.

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
Turn the key

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,520
and press this.

89
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
Finally, twist this.

90
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,320
Are you ready?

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,760
