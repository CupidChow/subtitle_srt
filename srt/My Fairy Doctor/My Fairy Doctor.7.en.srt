=Episode 7=

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,280
What do you do for a living?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,560
I was a physician
appointed by the Emperor

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,400
in Tang Dynasty.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,920
Father.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,320
He is Tang Caichen,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,520
a friend I met online.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,480
He was

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,440
a coser.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,640
A while ago,

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,200
he quit his job

12
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,240
after he broke up with his girlfriend.

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,840
His parents

14
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,680
are abroad.

15
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,400
I thought I'd take him for a walk

16
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,960
around this beautiful town,

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,680
but on the way,

18
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,640
his phone and wallet were stolen.

19
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,640
Father.

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
Can we let him stay here for a few days?

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,800
Sure.

22
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,880
- No problem.
- Okay?

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,840
Keep your mouth shut.

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,720
Well... What's his name again?

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,520
Tang.

26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,600
Yes.

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,160
Tang.

28
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,560
My daughter

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,760
is not young anymore.

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,520
I have a question for you.

31
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,120
Ask away, uncle.

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,360
I wonder where you plan to settle

33
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,000
when you two get married.

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,360
So,

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
are you agreeing on our marriage?

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,120
I knew it.

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,800
No,

38
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,200
father.

39
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,760
That's not it.

40
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,000
We're not dating each other.

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,720
Tang Qizi.

42
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,440
Let us talk.

43
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,640
Tang Qizi.

44
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,600
Young man.

45
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,880
What do you say?

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
It is up to you to decide

47
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,440
if Qizi can marry me.

48
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,080
Of course I want her
to stay in the clinic.

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,960
Sure.

50
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,160
Eat up.

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
Young man.

52
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
I knew you are a nice man

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,800
from the first moment I saw you.

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,080
What did you say

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,120
you do for a living?

56
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,320
A coser?

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,880
That's a great job.

58
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,600
So,

59
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,720
do your parents
allow you to move here?

60
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,440
Father.

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,880
Stop asking.

62
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Fine.

63
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,520
Eat up.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm full.

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
Me, too.

66
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Please excuse me.

67
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
Qizi, I'll have your stinky tofu.

68
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,640
Badou.

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,400
What is a coser?

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
Father, it is also known as a cosplayer.

71
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,800
It's an English term.

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,160
It's similar to the opera singer.

73
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,520
Opera singer?

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,640
Father.

75
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,400
Do you really believe
that guy is wealthy?

76
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
To put it bluntly, he is just

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,360
a useless unemployed man.

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,280
You know how Qizi is.

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,240
She is only attracted to

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
handsome guys.

81
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't give me that nonsense.

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
I see the young man

83
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
is honest

84
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,760
and he speaks politely.

85
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,240
He doesn't look like
the kind of guy you think he is.

86
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,640
Your sister finally
brought home a boyfriend.

87
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,280
We have to take good care of him.

88
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm going to clean up a room for him.

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,760
Clear the table.

90
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,960
Father, you don't get it.

91
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
Internet scams are rampant these days.

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
Are you leaving?

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,800
Fine.

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,760
These are all mine.

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
Tang.

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,400
Tang.

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,440
Father.

98
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,480
Qizi specially prepared

99
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,920
these daily necessities for you.

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
Since when?

101
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Thank you, both of you.

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,240
You're welcome.

103
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,720
It's getting late.

104
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,000
You should rest earlier.

105
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,080
Qi.

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,040
You should go back to your room.

107
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Okay.

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,160
Just a minute.

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
Let's go.

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Qizi.

111
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,640
You should not be

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,080
so aggressive with boys.

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
You didn't even let him talk

114
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,400
at the dining table just now.

115
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,640
No wonder no guy is courting you.

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,200
Who said so?

117
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,920
Hush.

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,920
Stay away from my girlfriend.

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,200
Fine, I get it.

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll get going.

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,080
Chat with him.

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,920
Okay.

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,640
Father.

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
Does this bracelet

125
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,320
have a history?

126
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,080
♪Light up all the stars♪

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
