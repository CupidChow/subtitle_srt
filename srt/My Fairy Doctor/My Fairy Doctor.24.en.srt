2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,080
Keep a distance?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,040
Why?

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,040
Because

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,520
he is the ancestor of our Tang family.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,400
Father.

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,960
Stop joking.

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,640
Qizi.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,640
Father is not joking.

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,480
It is recorded in this treatise.

11
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,640
During the Kaiyuan period,

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,240
Tang Qinjian was the head of
the Imperial Medical Office

13
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,240
and was known

14
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,760
by his contemporaries

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,800
as the supreme physician
of his generation.

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,920
This is exactly the same as
what Caichen had told us.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,480
We are all his descendants.

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,000
So you two can't be together.

19
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,560
Otherwise, it would be

20
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,480
chaotic.

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,720
No wonder he is so gifted

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,280
in medical skills.

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,480
Where did you get this?

24
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,120
Nianzhou brought it to us.

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,440
The mayor's ancestral hall
was under renovation.

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,240
This missing treatise was unearthed

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,200
during the reconstruction
of one of the rooms.

28
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760
I found it strange.

29
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,160
So I showed it to
Mr. Tang for confirmation.

30
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,360
I've checked it.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,320
The second half of the treatise

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
is exactly the same as
the genealogy in the ancestral hall.

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,160
This treatise

34
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,480
is definitely genuine.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,840
Qizi.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,720
What's wrong?

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,200
Nianzhou.

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,480
Do you really believe he is my ancestor?

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,200
Mr. Tang told me

40
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,640
that he came out of a painting.

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,800
I did find it unbelievable, too.

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,120
However,

43
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
since Mr. Tang had already confirmed it,

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,240
I no longer question it.

45
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,520
You, on the other hand,

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
are disappointed

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,440
to hear the news.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
Not really.

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,040
Qi.

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,520
I know you very well.

51
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
You frown

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,520
when you're unhappy.

53
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,200
Here's the thing.

54
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,880
He wants to stay,

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
but he has to find a soulmate

56
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
within 30 days,

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
or he will have to
return to the painting.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,640
That's easy.

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,720
I can help him.

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,760
Really?

61
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
Thirty days is enough time

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,600
to look for someone.

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
We can start

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
by looking around the town.

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
Thank you for your help.

66
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Don't mention it.

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,240
Qi.

68
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,640
Your concern

69
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,720
is my concern.

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,480
I did have

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
a little conflict

72
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,560
with your ancestor,

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
but that's in the past.

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
I'll help

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
with his problem.

76
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,040
I need to talk to her alone.

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
Please excuse us.

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,480
Qi.

79
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll get going.

80
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,880
Okay.

81
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
What did Wen Nianzhou tell you?

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
This man has bad intentions.

83
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't listen to him.

84
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,840
Also,

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
I really don't remember anything

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,920
about the ancestry.

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,280
The most important thing now is

88
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,440
to help you find your soulmate

89
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
within 30 days.

90
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,800
Didn't you come out of the painting

91
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
to stay alive?

92
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,600
But I already have someone to marry.

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,680
Forget about that.

94
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
We are no longer attached to each other.

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
I am not your wife.

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,200
Besides, I am your descendant.

97
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,200
We can't

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
be together in any case.

99
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,480
I'm tired.

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll go to my room.

101
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,520
Qizi.

102
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,080
Qizi.

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,240
Please calm down.

104
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,960
Calm down.

105
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,840
Quiet.

106
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,280
Quiet, please.

107
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,920
Listen.

108
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,640
Listen.

109
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Please line up.

110
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,760
Line up for a blind date.

111
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,360
Don't cut the line.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,440
Please line up.

113
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
Nianzhou is really something.

114
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
He gathered all the girls in town.

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
I would like to ask.

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
What are the criteria for a blind date?

117
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Look. Am I qualified?

118
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,560
We don't judge by face,

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,280
body,

120
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,960
age,

121
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,480
hairstyle

122
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,920
or skin tone.

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,320
Then what do you look for?

124
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
We only consider the date of birth.

125
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,560
Great.

126
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,200
Please consider mine.

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Please take out your ID.

128
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,560
I have it.

129
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,080
ID card.

130
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,080
I really like Dr. Tang.

131
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm all ready.

132
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,720
I was born

133
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,960
on March 15th,

134
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,840
1981.

135
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,440
Will that do?

136

Please register here first.

137
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,440
Thanks.

138
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
I don't need Dr. Tang to buy a house

139
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,840
or a car.

140
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,920
I can provide for him.

141
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
Can I meet him?

142
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,520
Miss.

143
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,440

145

This is my gift to Dr. Tang.
