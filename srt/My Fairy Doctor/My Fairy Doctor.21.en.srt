=Episode 21=

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,760
Where am I?

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,200
You're awake.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,240
Are you all right?

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,680
This is Master Bo Yi.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,680
Hello, master.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,800
I know the purpose

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,200
of your visit.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,760
I can break

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,800
the spell of the bracelet,

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,400
but

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,760
can you bear the consequences of it?

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,360
Tell us, master.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,120
We can handle it.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
He came from a painting

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,200
and you are a person of the present.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,720
If I break the connection

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
between you and the bracelet,

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,040
you will each return to your place

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,520
and he will return to the portrait.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
That won't do.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,600
He has to continue his medical studies

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,760
and work for the clinic.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,880
Tang Qinjian

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,960
was the head of
the Imperial Medical Office

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,000
during the Kaiyuan period
of the Tang dynasty

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,360
and was hailed by the people

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,680
as Divine Physician.

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,640
Does he still need to study medicine?

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,560
So his name is Tang Qinjian.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,200
I don't care who he is,

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,360
but he can't leave
without my permission.

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,160
Master.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
Can you think of any other way?

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,640
There is indeed another way

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,000
to break the spell.

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
Give me the jade pendant.

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,920
This jade pendant

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
will temporarily help you to stay,

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
but only for 30 days.

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,680
You can be resurrected

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,360
only if you find

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,920
a soulmate of the opposite gender

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,600
within 30 days.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,520
Otherwise,

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
your soul will be shattered

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,600
and you will cease to exist.

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,920
No way, master.

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,440
Thirty days is too short.

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Can he find one as we connect?

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,560
Physician Tang.

52
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,320
Please

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,360
come closer.

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,800
The bracelet and the jade pendant

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,600
were meant to be

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
two pieces of a single stone.

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,160
You would have been
perfect for each other,

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,320
but

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,040
your life span is over.

60
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,120
You two

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,600
are not just linked by marriage,

62
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,200
but also tied by a lifeline.

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,040
When tied together,

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,880
her life will be shortened

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
and her body will weaken rapidly.

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
The only way

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
to stop this is

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,600
to untie the string.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,960
Her fainting

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,240
just now

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
was one of the signs.

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
Break the spell.

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
Are you sure about this?

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,760
I disagree.

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
I have made up my mind.

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Master.

77
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,760
Please begin.
