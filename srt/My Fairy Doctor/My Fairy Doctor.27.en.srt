2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,320
Why are you in my room?

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,280
I'm waiting for you.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
I have something for you.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,480
This sachet

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,680
is called "The Healer".

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,720
It provides relief for

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,680
hundreds of minor illnesses.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,960
The herbs in it are
specially prepared for you.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,640
You have the habit of staying up late.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,640
Carry it with you.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
It helps you to sleep

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,720
and relieves fatigue.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,440
Thanks.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,320
Qizi.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,480
Can you do me a favour?

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
What is it?

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,280
Qizi.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
I'd like to go out.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,880
Go ahead.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
We are no longer tied together.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,520
Or are you afraid of getting lost?

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
That's why you want me to tag along.

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,160
No need.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,200
I have the locator.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
Come back early.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,560
Done.

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,040
I'll get going.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,920
Bye.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,320
Why does Dabao keep barking today?

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,600
Hello.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,640
Hi.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm not here to see a doctor.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm here for the blind date.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
Is it still open for registration?

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
You look pale.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,600
Shall I take your pulse first?

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,960
No need.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,040
My attending doctor is Wen Nianzhou.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,640
You should know each other.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
I need to provide my
identification details, right?

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,920
Yes.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,960
This is my ID.

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,520
I've found your soulmate.

Tang Caichen.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Why is the locator here?

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
Have you seen Tang Caichen?

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,400
No.

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
Isn't he in the room?
