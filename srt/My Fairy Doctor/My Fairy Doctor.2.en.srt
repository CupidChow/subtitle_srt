(Master Bo Yi)

4
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
What year is it?

5
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,680
What year?

6
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,040
Who on earth are you?

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,440
(Tang Qinjian) I was the head of
the Imperial Medical Office

8
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,840
during the Kaiyuan era
of the Tang Dynasty

9
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,960
and was in charge of

10
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,680
472 medical bureaus in the capital.

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,200
I was known as the Divine Physician

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,040
because I saved countless lives.

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,720
Did you say you were
from the Tang Dynasty?

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,520
How did you get here?

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,960
I came from the painting.

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,720
The painting?

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,040
Listen.

18
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
No matter where you came from

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,480
or where you're going,

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,320
I will never

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,560
tell anyone about tonight.

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,200
I need to go now.

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,880
Bye.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,720
Wait.

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,680
What now?

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
Your bracelet

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,840
and my jade pendant have made a contact.

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,520
You woke me up

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,680
and summoned me from the painting.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,640
From now on,

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,640
you must never leave my side.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,480
The connection will only be broken

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,680
when we are married

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,880
and have children.

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
Get married?

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,440
Are you out of your mind?

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,040
No.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Tang Qizi.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,240
This must be a dream.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,800
Tang Qizi.

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Wake up.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
You must be dreaming.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
I used to go to the banquets

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,640
at Pingkang District.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
A lady like you

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
could only be a server.

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,280
Although your face

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,000
and appearance are ordinary,

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,160
well,

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,240
since the bracelet has chosen you,

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
I can't complain.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,600
I hope you will tell your parents

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,880
that you will marry me soon.

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
Get married?

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
From now on,

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
you are my wife

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,920
and I am your husband.

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,280
Remember.

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,640
Call me the Divine Physician.

60
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,760
(Wulei Mountain)

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
You said

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,280
you came out of a painting

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,000
and I must not leave your side?

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,240
Yes.

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,720
Then

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,720
are you Ning Caichen?

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,080
My surname is Tang.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Tang

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,960
Caichen?

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
I advise you not to waste your time.

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,760
Master Hong Ren cast
a spell on this jade.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,880
The bracelet and the jade pendant
are originally a pair.

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,400
The two people who are connected

74
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,840
can't be separated from each other.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
Husband and wife stay together.

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,520
This is the significance of marriage.

77
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,280
♪Light up all the stars♪

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
♪Wish for staying with you forever♪

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,400
♪You're like the thriving Tang dynasty♪

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,800

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,880
♪We still love each other♪
