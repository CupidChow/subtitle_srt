=My Fairy Doctor=
=Episode 22=

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,600
I return this to you.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,880
The marriage is dissolved.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
From whence we came,

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,840
to whence we go.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,920
Remember.

7
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,080
You only get one chance

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,280
to return to the portrait.

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,640
Thank you, master.

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,280
You're back.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,440
She was fine when she left.

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,160
What happened?

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,360
Did you have a dispute?

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
I'll explain later.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,720
Did you break the spell?

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,640
Pack your things and leave.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,600
Now.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,880
Qizi.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,840
Wait.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,040
And my razor.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,000
I threw it away.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,400
She threw it?

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm no longer bound to him.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,920
I don't have to deal with him anymore.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,560
I can be lazy in bed,

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
stay up late,

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
be sloppy

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
and play games whenever I want.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,160
Isn't that nice?

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,040
He'd rather live for only 30 days
than be tied to me.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,400
What do I care?

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,840
Gosh.

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,620
(National Medical Centre)

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,920
You two

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
are not just linked by marriage,

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
but also tied by a lifeline.

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
When tied together,

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,320
her life will be shortened

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,720
and her body will weaken rapidly.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
The only way

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
to stop this is

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
to untie the string.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
Her fainting

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,480
just now

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,440
was one of the signs.

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,600
Good morning, Badou.

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,760
Are you greeting me?

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
Does she not see me?

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,000
No idea.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,920
Whatever.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,520
Caichen.

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,360
Let's go live.

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,640
Forget about that.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,600
His name is Tang Qinjian.

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
How can a divine physician

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,760
have time to live stream with you?

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
Qinjian.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,440
We're not disbanded, are we?

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,400
Help me figure out

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
why she stays angry for so long.

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
Girls need to be coaxed.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,040
What can I do to make her happy?

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
Well, girls

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,880
like flowers,

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,640
but my sister is an exception.

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
She likes stinky tofu.

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
He's never been in a relationship.

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,240
Don't listen to his nonsense.

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,280
You only have 29 days left to live.

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
Instead of worrying about this,

71
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,400
you're thinking about all this junk.

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
29 days?

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,600
Don't meddle in adults' affairs.

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
Qi.

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,280
Qi.

76
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,080
When you've finished cleaning up,

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
you and Tang

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,080
bring these medicines to Mr. Zhang.

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,200
I can go by myself.

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,440
I will tag along.

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,000
No need.

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm off now.

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,920
Qizi.

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,480
Qizi.

85
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,480
Let's go together.

86
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
What's going on?

87
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,400
Please keep a distance
of one foot from me.

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,480
Aren't you afraid I'll really leave?

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Leave then.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,160
♪Light up all the stars♪

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,280
