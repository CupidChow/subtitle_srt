00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,920
Tang Caichen.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,200
Do you remember what I told you?

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm not Tang Caichen.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,720
Don't mind that.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,840
From now on,

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,320
we are strangers,

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,480
okay?

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,800
You're so nosy.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,520
Hello.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,200
Hello.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,040
Three cups of latte, please.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,600
Sure.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,120
Thanks.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,320
Latte?

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,840
Why do you need to take the iron?
[*Latte's literal translation]

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,360
Come here.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,800
Hey.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,920
You sit here

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,040
and don't say a word.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,600
Okay?

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,640
Two metres.

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,080
Three metres.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Qi.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,680
(Wen Nianzhou)

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,280
Sorry for being late.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,000
It's all right. I just arrived.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
Sit down.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,440
This drink is so bitter.

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,840
How did you

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,320
get on with your father
about studying abroad?

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,360
My father still doesn't agree.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,880
Your father

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
hasn't changed a bit.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
I think

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,880
Chinese medicine is a pseudo-science.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
It will be eliminated sooner or later.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
I don't know why

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,560
he insists on it.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,880
Again.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,120
This Yin-Yang is just a childish system.

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,200
It is not as practical
as western medicine.

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Here's your coffee.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Thanks.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,400
This time,

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,880
I brought the daughter of the CEO

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,080
to the town for treatment.

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
If you can't go abroad,

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
would you like to consider
joining my medical team?

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,240
Qizi?

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,320
Qizi?

52
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
I will do it myself.

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
This is so absurd.

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
How dare you defame Chinese medicine?

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
And you did such an indecent thing

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
to someone else's wife in public.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,280
Who are you?

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,360
I was the head of the Imperial
Medical Office during Tang Dynasty

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
and was in charge of 472
medical bureaus in the capital.

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
I am also her husband.

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,960
Qizi.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you know him?

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,720
No.

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
Stay away from my girlfriend.

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,160
I don't have time to argue with you.

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,320
Come with me.

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,080
Nianzhou, I have to go.

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,680
Bye.

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll explain to you later.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,240
Tang Caichen, what are you doing?

71
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,480
I told you to act like a stranger.

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,680
Why did you suddenly come forward?

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,200
This guy has

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,280
an evil face.

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,160
Stay away from him.

76
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,080
Don't badmouth Nianzhou.

77
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,080
He's obviously a gentleman,

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,880
unlike you.

79
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
Cold-blooded

80
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,760
and arrogant.

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
Do you want to get on

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
or be dragged?

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
Do you know how to ride this?

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,520
♪Light up all the stars♪

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
