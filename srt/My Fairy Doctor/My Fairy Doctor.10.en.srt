2
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,800
Did you

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,200
see it all?

4
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,560
If you say a word about it,

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,640
I'll kill you.

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,960
I have a question.

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,240
What now?

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,320
How do you imprint
the rabbit on the fabric?

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,440
Rabbit?

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
Break the spell now!

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Quick!

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,800
Hurry up.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,360
Don't worry too much about it.

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,280
It is perfectly normal

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,360
for a wife and husband.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,280
Rest assured.

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll be responsible for you.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
Cut the nonsense!

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Just stay there.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,200
So,

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,560
where are we going?

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,720
Qi.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,160
You're up so early today.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,840
Good morning, father.

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Well,

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm waking him up.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,200
Tang Caichen.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,480
Get up.

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,000
Get up.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Father.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,840
We have something to do.

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
So we'll be off.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,920
Hurry up.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Oh,

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,320
look at this couple.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
It's all your fault.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
Now I have to sneak around

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,880
and my plans to go abroad
have gone down the drain.

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,360
I've been saving money for so long.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Maybe I can go with you.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Do you have an ID?

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
Can you afford a plane ticket?

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
In your dreams.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,760
Since we don't have a solution,

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
why don't you try
to accept my existence?

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,440
I have no other choice.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
What are you doing?

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I want to cut your hair.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,680
Our hair is from our parents.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,360
We must never disfigure it.

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,880
If you want to fit in
with modern society,

52
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,040
start with your hair.

53
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,600
Do you like men with short hair?

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,200
I don't want to walk down the street

55
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,480
with a freak.

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Fine.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Don't you dare lie to me,

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,640
or else.

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,160
Fret not.

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,400
I'll take you shopping for
some clothes after this.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,400
Plus 538,

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
plus 3962

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
equal to 24,500.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
It cost me

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
24,500 RMB in just one day.

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,160
Tang.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
This is all my savings.

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
I may be new here,

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,120
but I will not remain a stranger.

70
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,520
Do not worry.

71
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,360
I'll pay you back

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,960
ten times the amount when I'm rich.

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,080
When is that?

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,760
In the future.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,120
That's it.

76
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,960
You don't have any money, do you?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,720
You should have
something of value on you

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,400
from the Tang Dynasty.
