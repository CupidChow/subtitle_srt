00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,640
You are my wife.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
Can you stop saying

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm your wife?

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,800
This is verbal harassment.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,880
We have no other choice

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,120
but to stay together

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,680
since we can't be separated.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,360
Marriage is based on love.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,440
We can't get married because

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
we don't have feelings for each other,

12
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,240
do you understand?

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,600
So

14
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,640
how do we develop feelings?

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,320
Watch TV more

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,840
and learn from people.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Also, learn more modern languages.

Give it back.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,360
You should quit.

You've been doing this for over a year,

45

yet you only have a few followers.

46

What's the point?

47
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,240
You're wasting food.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,920
So what if I have a small fan base?

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,400
I can gain overnight fame anytime.

Can you find
a sweetheart with that face?

67
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
You are so tan.

I guess it's hard for you

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,880

So

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
what should I do?

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
Anything.

105
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080

Yes.

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,320
You can start with a tea facial mask.

113
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Use lemon juice with red dates
to cleanse your face.

114
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
After that, pat your cheeks

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
with egg white or lotion.

116
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,560
Each individual's
skin type is different.

117
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
So it may differ.
