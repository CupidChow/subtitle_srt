=My Fairy Doctor=
=Episode 29=

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,120
She was born

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,640
with Qi Deficiency.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,440
She suffers fatigue

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,480
and is lack of energy.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,440
Can it be cured?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,800
There is no cure

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,200
for this disease.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,200
It can only be treated slowly.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,320
Again?

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm so tired

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,200
of hearing these words.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,560
You claim to have
a hundred years of history

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,040
and that's all you can do?

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,440
Father.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,800
I feel congested in my chest.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,320
Lili.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm out of breath.

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,280
Lili.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,080
What’s wrong?

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,240
Dr. Wen.

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,720
I'll get the medicine.

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,680
Quick.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,240
This sachet

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,520
is called "The Healer".

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,080
It provides relief for

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,200
hundreds of minor illnesses.

28
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,560
Lili, smell this.

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,920
Lili.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,440
How do you feel?

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,160
I feel much better.

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,400
What kind of medicine is this?

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,720
Mr. Liu.

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
We have another doctor.

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
He developed this.

36
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,320
Maybe

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,880
he can treat her.

38
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,960
Forget it.

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,880
I've given you a chance.

40
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,680
I hate quacks like you the most.

41
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,440
Leave now.

42
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you mean Dr. Tang Qinjian?

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,640
Yes.

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,480
Father.

45
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
I want to give it a try.

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,160
Father.

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,760
One last chance.

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
You go and get Dr. Tang.

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,520
If he can't cure my daughter's disease,

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,120
I will immediately

51
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,120
demolish your clinic

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,680
and your whole family

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,720
must leave right away.

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Okay.

55
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,800
That's a deal.

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,760
Ancestor.

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,920
It's all my fault

58
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
for what happened to the clinic.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,560
Please help us.

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
I will come every day and honour you.

61
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:24,960
Qizi.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
What exactly happened that day?

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Why don't you re-enact the scene?

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,200
I don't think that's necessary.

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,320
It's embarrassing.

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
Give it a try.

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
It won't kill you.

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
He's right, Qi.

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,080
This is our last resort.

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
All right.

71
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll try.

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
Ancestors.

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,920
You were all professional

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
and respectable,

75
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,800
but why did you bring up such
a narrow-minded man like my father?

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,600
That doesn't work.

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Is it not this?

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,360
So please

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,600
come out and talk to him.

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
Qi.

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,560
Are you cursing
your father to die early?

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,440
It was out of anger.

83
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Fine.

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
I won't argue with you on this.

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
Think again.

86
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,720
What happened that night?

87
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,200
I think

88
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,000
there was thunder

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,040
and it was raining heavily.

90
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,760
I have an idea.

91
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,400
♪Light up all the stars♪

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,840
♪Wish for staying with you forever♪

93
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,520
♪You're like the thriving Tang dynasty♪

94

95
