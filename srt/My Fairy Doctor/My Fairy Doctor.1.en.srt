(National Medical Centre)

00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,840
My name is Tang Qizi,

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,440
the 52nd generation of the Tang family
of traditional Chinese medicine.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,680
Tang family has been a family of doctors

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,920
for generations since the Tang Dynasty.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,040
(National Medical Centre)
However, my father,

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,200
an narrow-minded man, is rigid

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,160
and inflexible,

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,880
unlike me.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,360
When it comes to making
money from medical treatment,

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,600
I have a brilliant way of doing it.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,160
(Tang Qizi)
Are you...

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,600
pregnant?

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Nonsense!

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm still a virgin!

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,280
(Tang Badou)
Who is that girl in your arms?

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm helping my niece

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,400
getting some cold medicine.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
And you call me sick?

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
You're the ones who are sick.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,480
You are really sick.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,400
Believe it.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,040
Tell me then.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,680
What illness do I have?

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,160
Have you recently had
a bitter taste in your mouth

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,400
and ulcers on your lips?

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,720
Yes.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,840
Severe dizziness,

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
sleep disorders

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,640
and swollen tongue.

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,320
Indeed.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,880
Your disease

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,280
may seem common,

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
but it is very dangerous.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,080
The incubation period is long.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
Once it breaks out,

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,320
it could...

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,840
kill you.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,640
What?

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,720
Then what should I do?

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,520
Miss.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,120
The price of consultation

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,240
and prescription is separately charged.

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,080
No problem.

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,840
Dr. Tang.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,880
Please help me.

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
Here are the medicines.

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
Make sure to take them regularly.

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,440
Thank you.

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,200
Thank you, Dr. Tang.

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
I'll boil them when I get home.

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,080
Thank you so much.

55
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,920
Goodbye, miss.

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,560
Bye.

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,680
Qizi.

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,840
How did you know she's sick?

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,080
I saw her licking her lips all the time

60
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,240
and figured she must have
an ulcer on her mouth.

61
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,680
It is actually just
a symptom of excess heat.

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
Brilliant, Tang Qizi.

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
You made it sound so serious.

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,720
Of course.

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,360
That's how I make money.

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
Is Dr. Tang around?

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes.

Father.

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,560
Why are you

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,920
back early?

and respectable,

82

but why did you bring up

such an narrow-minded man
like my father?

84

He wouldn't let me see patients
