00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,800
Mr. Zhang.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,920
Take your medicine on time.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
I'll come again for a follow-up.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,560
All right.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,680
We also have
a leading physician in our clinic.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,080
Caichen.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,840
Tang Caichen?

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,560
Excuse me.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,640
Okay.

Tang Qinjian.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,720
Tang Qinjian.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,920
Tang Qinjian.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,000
Qinjian.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,200
Tang Qinjian.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,560
Tang Qinjian.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,680
Tang Qinjian.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,160
Tang Qinjian.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,880
I was just throwing a tantrum.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,920
Why are you so petty?

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
Tang Qinjian.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
Come back.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,240
Tang Qinjian!

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
Come back!

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,440
Tang Qinjian!

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,800
My bad.

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,640
Sorry.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,200
Sorry.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Tang Caichen!

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,000
Where have you been?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,960
I couldn't find you.

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,560
I bought you stinky tofu.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
Then I got lost.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,800
I don't have the little
square box like yours either.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
Don't ever wander off again.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,520
Here.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
What about Dabao?

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,640
Dabao has lived here
for more than ten years.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,080
Even if he runs away,

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,600
he knows the way back.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,000
Take this locator with you.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
So that wherever you are,

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
I can find you.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
Anywhere?

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,320
Yes.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,560
Anywhere.

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
I will not allow

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
any slip-up in my plans.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
You are not

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
a match for me.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
I heard that you are
an expert in counterfeiting.

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
I will send you the document later.

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Sure.

What are you doing?

Uncle.

65

What is this about?

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,760
Father, get up.

From now on,

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,400
you should keep a distance from him.

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,760
Keep a distance?

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,720
Why?

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,720
Because

73
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,200
he is the ancestor of our Tang family.
