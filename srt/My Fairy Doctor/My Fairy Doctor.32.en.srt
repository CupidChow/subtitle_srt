2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,040
Sorry, Qizi.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Why don't you return to the painting?

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,680
I can just look at your portrait.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,840
That's impossible.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,760
I had only one chance.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,040
Then why did you come out again?

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,440
Because I haven't properly
bid you farewell.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,760
Then

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,360
can we reconnect?

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,840
Let's just enjoy our last moments.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,040
Okay.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,040
I'll do it for you.

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Yide.

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,040
Yes?

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,680
I want to marry Qizi.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,800
Father.

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,120
If you don't agree, I will...

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
What?

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Qinjian.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,520
Do you really love my daughter?

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,080
Father.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
Is that a yes?

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,640
I can't say no

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,960
because you two have already...

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,720
Father.

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
You are the best.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
When did you become so open-minded?

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,440
This is not like you.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Actually,

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,960
I've always been keen on Qinjian.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
If Wen Nianzhou

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,640
hadn't said that
Tang Qinjian was our ancestor,

35
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,280
they would have

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,760
gotten married a long time ago.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Caichen.

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Are you really not our ancestor?

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
I think you should really eat more

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
fish to nourish your brain.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,560
So I was kept in the dark.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
(From now on,)

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,360

45

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,040
(that you will marry me soon.)

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
(You are my wife)

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,960
(and I am your husband.)

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,400
(Remember.)

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
(Call me the Divine Physician.)

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,880
Tang Caichen.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
Don't think I'm yours just because

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,440
we sleep in the same room.

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,200
I hate you.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,240
Keep your distance from me.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,440
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Bow to parents.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,040
Bow to each other.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,200
To the bridal bedroom.

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
Wait.
