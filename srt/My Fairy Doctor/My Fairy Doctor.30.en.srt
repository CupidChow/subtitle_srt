2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,440
Badou.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,800
Isn't that a bit rude?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Not at all.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
This is the way to force him out.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,720
Bothered or not.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,560
All I know is

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,880
this portrait is ruined.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,680
Forget it.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,920
Let's think of another way.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,360
This is my fault.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,480
I can't keep our family business.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,360
Blame me.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,960
I thought he would come back.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,880
Let's go.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Tang Caichen.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,400
I used to accuse you of being insolent

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,600
and unreasonable.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,600
It's all my fault.

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,560
I should have believed you,

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,640
not Wen Nianzhou.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,600
You must be disappointed
in me, aren't you?

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,720
You always said I have no goals,

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
but now I do.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,280
I want you back.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Divine Physician.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,080
Please come out of the painting.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,440
Qi.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,160
Let's go.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
We have

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,040
lost the clinic for real this time.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
Says who?

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
Ancestor.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
What took you so long to show up?

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
It would be degrading

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
if I showed up as soon
as you summoned me.

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,040
I thought it would be interesting

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,840
if I surprised you

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,080
when you were desperate.

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,680
Then why didn't you just never come out?

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
I was afraid that
if I came out any later,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,240
you'd all be missing arms and legs.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,480
Besides,

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
didn't someone say she needed me?

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,840
Tell me.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,280
What do you need?

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I didn't expect it was you.

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Don't get so full of yourself.

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,560
You are just a junior apprentice.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,320
Do you really think
you are a miracle doctor

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,240
who can cure a terminal illness?

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,520
Dr. Tang.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
I signed up for your blind date,

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
but too bad, you weren't there.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,360
Do I meet the criteria to be your wife?

57
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
I've already

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
got someone else in mind.

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,400
Who is that lucky girl

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,440
to be your wife?

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,560
I'd be lucky

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
to be her husband.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Mr. Liu.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
(Minghe National Medical Centre)
Take this medicine

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,440
three times a day

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,960
and you will see results
in less than six months.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,200
Another half a year?

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Why is it taking so long?

69
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,800
Your daughter's condition

70
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,960
is too severe

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,720
to use acute medication.

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,600
Stop all previous treatments.

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Use my prescription first

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
to tonify her body.

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
After she balances the Qi,

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,440
she can slow down the medication.

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,400
Understand?

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,240
So are you saying

79
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,000
that Lili was held up?

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,040
No.

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,240
As for that,

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,760
you can ask her former doctor.

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
What kind of medicine did he prescribe

84
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,600
to make her body so weak?

85
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,920
Mr. Liu, I can explain.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,600
Enough.
