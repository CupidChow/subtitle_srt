=The Mystery of Dragon Town=

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,540
=Episode 11=

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,389
Hello?

14
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,519
You know every nook and corner

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,349
of Dragon Town, right?

16
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:57,989
Of course.

17
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:59,870
Look into this place for me.

18
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,669
Linjiangxian Theater.

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,350
Just leave it to me.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,159
(Why did both the white-faced man)

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,469
(Linjiangxian Theater)
(and the mysterious woman show up here?)

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,949
Can you stop scaring me?

23
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,150
No.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,519
Do you know

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,430
why Master Jiu is so worried?

26
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,309
Is it because
of the Peace Preservation Corps?

27
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,630
You should stay away from Yang Ziqi.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,439
Well...

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,150
There's nothing going on between us.

30
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,469
I mean

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,799
what you're investigating

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,109
is getting dangerous.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,598
The Yin Sting Bug

34
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,109
showed a strong reaction

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,078
because her body

36
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,949
seemed to contain opium.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,149
Yet, in order to achieve
such a great effect,

38
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,080
there should be at least
one jin of opium in He Shanshan's body

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,350
to make the bug go out of control.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,959
Who would

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,549
take one jin of opium?

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,758
That's impossible.

43
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,750
Unless

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,030
it's not opium.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,470
I don't know what that would be either.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,518
That's why

47
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,709
it's tricky.

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,269
Oh, right.

49
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,030
Here's a Revitalizing Leaf.

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,869
It can mitigate some symptoms.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,190
If my master were still around,

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,030
he'd definitely know
what all this is about.

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,070
Indeed.

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,949
If Madam Ma were still around,

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,669
she could be the old man's partner.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,310
Forget it.

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,750
Madam Ma would never fall
for a man like Master Jiu.

58
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,559
You're right.

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,230
She would be too good for him.

60
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,399
But, you know what,

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,230
I get mad at the thought of it.

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,149
The townsfolk see me as a body snatcher!

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,518
In the eyes of the world,

64
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,358
people like us

65
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,949
have always been seen
as riffraff, unworthy of respect.

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,829
Forget what
those narrow-minded people think.

67
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,470
Think about it.

68
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,439
Miss Liu from the Falling Petals Cave,

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,559
Granny Ghost of the Mountains,
Grandma Sun,

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,478
and that...

71
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,590
Enough.

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,310
Stop it, Luoluo.

73
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,910
I know you're worried about me.

74
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,350
I swear.

75
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,829
I swear.

76
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,638
I'll just locate Yushuang's body.

77
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,439
And I'll stay out

78
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,630
of the rest.

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,959
Who's that?

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,989
Xiaojiu.

81
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,389
Xiaojiu.

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,070
It's that detective.

83
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,630
Why is that fool here
at this early hour?

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,839
Old man,

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,829
hide yourself.

86
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,358
Go ahead.

87
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,190
Sure, I'll go into hiding.

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,629
I'll hide myself.

89
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,189
Why do I need to hide myself?

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,429
Xiaojiu.

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,790
Stop.

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,069
What are you doing here?

93
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,950
Leave the Dragon Town.

94
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,890
(Renchunhe)

95
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,590
What started
as a simple corpse theft case

96
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,910
now involves
increasingly tangled forces.

97
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:55,989
Master Jiu's death

98
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,869
might also be related to this.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,629
We're in more danger than ever

100
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,309
What a good friend you are.

101
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,309
Out of all my friends,

102
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,189
you're the most generous of all.

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,910
If you ever need to arrange a funeral,

104
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,838
just let me know.

105
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,989
I'll be there for you.

106
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,549
You're not leaving?

107
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,309
Yang Ziqi.

108
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,629
What are you doing?

109
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,109
Don't...

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,549
Are you nuts, Yang Ziqi?

111
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,150
Don't think the money you gave me
gives you the right to do as you please.

112
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:55,629
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,910
I just want to pay respects

114
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,109
to Master Jiu.

115
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,470
Master Jiu.

116
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,999
Today,

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,509
I came to bid farewell.

118
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,030
You had been

119
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,429
a righteous

120
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,910
and carefree man.

121
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,150
Take care.

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,239
You spoke

123
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,830
as if you knew my master well.

124
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,390
You officials
are surely good with words.

125
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,390
Master.

126
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,638
I will work hard to find out the truth

127
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,869
and clear your name.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,910
You're determined to investigate it,

129
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,910
right?

130
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,590
Yes.

131
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,189
Well,

132
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,150
let me explain myself.

133
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,069
Detective Yang. Detective Yang!

134
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,109
Yang Ziqi. Yang Ziqi!

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,669
Wait, that's...

136
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,309
I wouldn't want to pretend to be dead
for the rest of my life.

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,718
In other words,

138
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,119
all of the deceased

139
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,989
are related to this theater.

140
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,318
We'll reach a breakthrough

141
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,069
if we manage to locate the theater.

142
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,158
Have you found it,

143
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,470
Liao Sheng?

144
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,189
Look.

145
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:40,869
Fuli Road.

146
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,910
No. 32.

147
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,429
Fuchun House?

148
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,958
Isn't that a pleasure house?

149
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,429
Do you know it

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,830
well?

151
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,989
He does.

152
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,549
Stop your nonsense thought.

153
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,150
It's not what you think.

154
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,039
This address was provided

155
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,359
by the mole

156
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,470
of my mole's mole.

157
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,278
It's said to be a sinister place.

158
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,758
During its construction,

159
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,470
a lot of human skeletons were found.

160
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,920
They can even enable
their distinguished guests

161
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,470
run businesses in netherworld.

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,989
Nonsense.

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,749
Sir.

164
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,270
Detective Yang.

165
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,390
We can't just take their word for it.

166
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,869
Let's hear him out.

167
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,919
I don't want
to rely on those rumors either.

168
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,590
I'd like to do interviews there.

169
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,119
Only their distinguished guests

170
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,599
get to receive intel.

171
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,470
Ordinary folk can just forget about it.

172
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,200
That's how secretive they are.

173
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,190
I'm doing a favor by providing you
with this clue, right?

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,239
I even took their picture

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,430
during the house's opening.

176
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,070
It's right there. Have a look.

177
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,149
Who's this?

178
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,109
That's the owner
of Fuchun House, Sui Wen.

179
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,398
Is he...

180
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,430
What?

181
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,310
Is he Sui Wen?

182
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,798
Can you finish your sentence

183
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,109
next time?

184
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,989
You gave me a fright.

185
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,989
Is this outfit necessary?

186
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,109
And look at this scary makeup.

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,470
If you want to alert them,
you can do without the outfit.

188
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,590
Oh, right.

189
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,950
Did you have something to say

190
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,509
when we were in the newspaper office?

191
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,119
I've figured it out.

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,029
Sui Wen owns the Fuchun House.

193
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,719
He's the white-faced man I met

194
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,950
in the Yutang House.

195
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,479
I knew it.

196
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,029
We're getting closer to the truth.

197
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,440
It's dangerous in there.
So you must be cautious.

198
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,590
I know. Stop repeating it.

199
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,079
I'm just not used to it.

200
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,470
Once I've got used to it,

201
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,789
I'll just breeze in it.

202
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,509
Mind your conduct.

203
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,199
I'm sick of staying home

204
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,479
and seeing your face.

205
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,230
What's wrong with me having fun here?

206
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,438
If you can do this,

207
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,638
why can't I?

208
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,599
I am a man.

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,438
You are a woman.

210
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:05,710
That's the difference!

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,678
What's with it?
You have fun with women.

212
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,320
I'll have fun with men. It's just the same.

213
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,878
I'm here to take advantage of them.
And you'll be taken advantage of.

214
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,029
It's not the same!

215
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,830
If you dare come here for fun,
stay out of my business, then.

216
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,558
Got it?

217
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,600
I'll do it. I'm going to
have fun with some men.

218
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,789
Wait... Stop right there!

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,269
What's with these two?

220
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,319
Sir.

221
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,670
Please, come on in.

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,879
Three men

223
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,389
made their way to the east corridor.

224
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,909
And they haven't returned yet.

225
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,278
It's a dead end there.

226
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,350
It's most likely
where the secret theater is.

227
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,470
Let's go.

228
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,670
We'll check it out.

229
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,909
I see it.

230
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,959
They're there with the tickets.

231
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,079
They enter the theater
holding those tickets.

232
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,999
And

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,719
they will be given
ticket stubs in return.

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,839
Those ticket stubs

235
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,190
look exactly like that we saw
in the newspaper office.

236
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,749
Well,

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,670
is this your first time here?

238
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,479
Yes, I came here

239
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,950
after your recommendation.

240
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,398
Sir, ma'am. Are you here to seek wealth,
for fortune-telling,

241
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,710
or ask about someone?

242
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
We'd like to ask about a person.

243
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,389
What was the deceased's name?

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,029
What?

245
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,479
I mean

246
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,999
the name of the one

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,509
you'd like to find in netherworld.

248
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,950
Yu Jiu.

249
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,230
That's right.

250
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,530
(Yu Jiu)

251
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,149
Hey.

252
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,989
Black Tortoise, no. 4 and 5.

253
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:36,430
Please.

254
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,590
Follow me.

255
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,599
Be careful. We'll run if things go wrong.

256
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,149
Liao Sheng is waiting for us out there.

257
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,149
Careful.

258
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,560
I don't feel good about this place.

259
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,629
- What's wrong with it?
- They're having a soul descent ritual.

260
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,470
Sir, ma'am.

261
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
Please be quiet. You wouldn't want
to disturb the divine being.

262
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,389
The ritual

263
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,950
is about to begin.

264
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,398
Please remove your shoes

265
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,430
and place your bare feet
on the spirit money.

266
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,149
Let's just play it by ear.

267
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,109
Please take a Spirit-Linking Pill.

268
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,230
Please place your palms together.

269
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,869
Distinguished guests

270
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,230
and business owners.

271
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,158
You're not allowed
to wear a Buddha necklace

272
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,079
or jade beads.

273
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,470
Please hand over

274
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,629
your talismans too.

275
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,670
If there's anything else,

276
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,629
we shall begin the ritual now.

277
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,039
Well, once you've reached
the Yuangong Residence,

278
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,960
please

279
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,919
return immediately

280
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,279
after asking all your questions.

281
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,039
Remember.

282
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,120
Don't eat what you see down there.

283
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,919
Now we will have the Patriarch
to lead us there.

284
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,519
Greetings, the God of the Land.

285
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,679
Yu Shuang.

286
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,559
Yu Shuang!

287
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720

288
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
