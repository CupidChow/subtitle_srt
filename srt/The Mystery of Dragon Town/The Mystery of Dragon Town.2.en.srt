=Episode 2=

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,070
Xiaojiu!

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,558
You disobedient little brat!

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,989
Get over here now!

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,949
Coming!

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,759
Coming!

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,709
I'm here!

19
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:04,198
Your guts are getting bigger by the day.

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,029
Who said you could
take jobs on your own?

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,829
You believe me now, don't you?

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,639
Last night's job alone

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,589
made as much as ten runs.

24
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,159
One more like that,

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,309
and we'll have enough to buy the house.

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,630
I'm awesome, right?

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,200
It's all because that liquor
was too strong last night.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,870
It messed everything up.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,678
Old man,

30
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:31,879
what now?

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,439
Didn't I earn money?

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,398
Besides,

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,398
I even drew a fortune before I left.

34
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:37,790
It was a lucky one.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,790
Go back inside
and look at that fortune again.

36
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,118
I remember it clearly.

37
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,350
It was lucky.

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,238
You missed a piece of the fortune slip.

39
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,038
One piece was stuck
in the crack of the table.

40
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,398
Add that in,

41
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,150
then you've got the full reading.

42
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,359
So what?

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,198
I already got paid.

44
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,029
Who cares if it's lucky or not?

45
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,678
Funeral folks, get out here!

46
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:02,669
Get out here!

47
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,270
Where the hell is everyone?

48
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,678
Where is everyone?

49
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,439
Come out!

50
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,310
Come out!

51
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,959
Where the hell is everyone?

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,839
What are you doing?

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,879
What's going on?

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,900
I should be asking you!
What are you trying to pull?

55
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,679
Come on, tell me.

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,159
You...

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,918
Get down!

58
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,869
Xiaojiu!

59
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,669
A real man doesn't fight women.

60
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:19,719
Let me ask you.

61
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,719
Your master
always handled things properly.

62
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,879
So why is it with you,

63
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,389
our young master has gone missing?

64
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,269
Speak!

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,839
Where did you take our young master?

66
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,839
Hand him over!

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,839
Who's your young master?

68
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,030
I don't know him.

69
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,350
Yu Shuang.

70
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,750
You don't know Yu Shuang?

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,709
Yu Shuang?

72
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,159
I already delivered

73
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,918
his body to his parents yesterday.

74
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,959
They held a happy funeral.

75
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,230
I even got the joy money.

76
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,389
Nonsense!

77
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,470
There's no way my son is dead!

78
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,669
And who the hell are you?

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,269
You're absolutely full of it!

80
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,470
Master.

81
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,318
We held a happy funeral
for my son just last night?

82
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,869
We even gave you joy money?

83
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,070
You're spouting complete nonsense!

84
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,198
My wife and I only got back
to Dragon Town this morning.

85
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,869
We've never even seen you!

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,478
Where did you take our Shuang?

87
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,750
No, hold on.

88
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,750
Yu Shuang...

89
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,560
Maybe it's just someone
with the same name?

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,078
Is it him?

91
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,190
Look carefully.

92
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,198
Yes.

93
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,869
Master, this is...

94
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,910
You two are Yu Shuang's parents?

95
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,989
Then...

96
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,918
Then who were

97
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,709
the people I saw last night?

98
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,478
I gave my word as a commander.
I'll solve the case as soon as possible.

99
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,679
(Director, Wu Liyi)

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,679
Don't pull me!

101
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,910
Director Wu!

102
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,679
- Director Wu!
- Director Wu!

103
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,038
- Let go!
- Director Wu!

104
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,470
- Let's talk this out!
- Come on out!

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,518
You, come out!

106
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:47,918
Give us justice!

107
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,839
I'm here, aren't I?

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,719
Would I run?

109
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,198
Yes.

110
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,350
Where's the director?

111
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,750
Director.

112
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,879
Master Yu, Madam Yu,

113
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,999
what brings you here?

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,999
Director Wu,

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,310
you must give us justice.

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,078
All right.

117
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,429
Come, have a seat.

118
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,198
All right.

119
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,879
I'm not leaving.

120
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,399
I'll stay here until you sort this out.

121
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,269
Until your man come back.

122
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,949
You...

123
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,829
How did he even end up like this?

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,398
Look, his limbs
and joints are all broken.

125
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,470
Blood, there's blood in his eyes.

126
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,950
What's that symbol on his hand?

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,030
He...

128
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,150
They're calling a soul back.

129
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,690
(Commanding Talisman)

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,958
A vengeful spirit killed him!

131
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,270
A vengeful spirit killed him!

132
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,629
You go!

133
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,590
Me?

134
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,109
I can't.

135
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,958
I can't.

136
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,599
Hurry up!

137
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,799
Isn't he your relative?

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,069
If not you, then who?

139
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,309
Get him out of there! Now!

140
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,669
Stop.

141
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,109
Is this how you officers in Dragon Town
handle an investigation?

142
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,069
This is outrageous.

143
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,470
The body
is a critical piece of evidence.

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,549
And you're
just destroying it recklessly?

145
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,710
If key evidence is lost because of this,

146
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,270
then tell me,

147
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,390
who takes responsibility?

148
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,331
You... Who even are you?

149
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,080
(Detective, Yang Ziqi)
Who let you in here?

150
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,790
(Detective Yang Ziqi)
This is a crime scene!

151
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,239
No unauthorized personnel allowed.

152
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,158
Get out!

153
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,189
Oh, so you do know it's a crime scene?

154
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,109
Then why wasn't there
a single officer guarding the door?

155
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,559
I sat in there

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,989
for a full three minutes.

157
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,189
And you clueless idiot
didn't notice a thing.

158
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,189
Do you even have the faintest sense
of what it means to be a cop?

159
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,679
Who the hell do you think you are?

160
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,999
You think you can lecture me?

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,869
I...

162
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,989
You must be tired of living!

163
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,230
You believe me or not,
I'll shoot you right here!

164
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,119
You... You're good...

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,479
Do you even know who I am?

166
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,189
You just wait!

167
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,669
You're in big trouble.

168
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,958
You messed with Liu.

169
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,390
Do you know who his brother-in-law is?

170
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,830
I only care who reported the case.

171
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,230
Who called it in?

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,950
I did.

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,830
What happened?

174
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,629
Our village

175
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,710
seems to be haunted
by a vengeful spirit.

176
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,718
Cut the crap.

177
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,989
What spirit?

178
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,318
If it wasn't a ghost, how else

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,480
could he break his own bones
and stuff himself in a barrel?

180
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,950
What did this guy do?

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,629
His name's Wang Chuanfu.

182
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,669
He owned the pawnshop in our town.

183
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,799
Earlier,

184
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,078
there were all those
ghost rumors around town, right?

185
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,999
I figured he just got scared
and went back hometown.

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,989
But then...

187
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,679
Today, a few of us household heads

188
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,989
were holding a meeting here.

189
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,869
And

190
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,189
we found him dead.

191
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,078
Vengeful spirits roam.

192
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,910
The people live in fear.

193
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,429
We pray for the gods' protection.

194
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,838
Vengeful spirits roam.

195
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,039
The people live in fear.

196
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,910
We pray for the gods' protection.

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,758
Vengeful spirits roam.

198
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,718
The people live in fear.

199
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,869
We pray for the gods' protection.

200
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,919
Vengeful spirits roam.

201
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,879
The people live in fear.

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,030
We pray for the gods' protection.

203
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,039
Vengeful spirits roam.

204
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,198
The people live in fear.

205
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,509
We pray for the gods' protection.

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,230
Hurry up.

207
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,758
Walked right into it yourself.

208
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,350
Surround him! Don't let him get away!

209
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,549
Trying to grab my gun, huh?

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,799
My brother-in-law's gonna make you pay!

211
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,590
Get your director out here.

212
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,150
You think you're even worthy
of mentioning my brother-in-law?

213
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,559
What's wrong, Liu?

214
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,669
Who bit you this time?

215
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,790
Brother...

216
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,669
Director.

217
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,078
He disrupted the crime scene

218
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,439
and tried to snatch a gun!

219
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,590
What?

220
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,710
Detective Yang.

221
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,590
Put it down.

222
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,269
Detective Yang,

223
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,479
I've received word
from the Commanding Officer long ago.

224
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,470
I've been waiting for you to arrive.

225
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,989
Director.

226
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,839
Ignore this

227
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,869
pack of fools.

228
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,909
- Come. We'll talk in my office.
- No need.

229
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,719
Let's

230
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,190
talk about the case first.

231
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,789
All right.

232
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,518
Let's talk about the case first.

233
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,278
Don't touch me!

234
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,029
I told you it wasn't me! Move aside!

235
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,509
Everyone's here now, aren't they?

236
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,438
So why aren't we investigating?

237
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,278
They've been working nonstop on cases.

238
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,158
So...

239
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,590
Director, this matter...

240
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,350
Director Wu!

241
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,190
Director Wu!

242
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,319
Oh, my poor Shuang...

243
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,710
Director Wu.

244
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,509
Where are you, my poor Shuang...

245
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,278
Director Wu.

246
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,670
Please, you must help us find our son.

247
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,389
Director Wu.

248
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,959
Let me introduce.

249
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,190
This is the new Detective Yang.

250
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,629
He's the right-hand man
of the Commanding Officer.

251
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,719
You all,

252
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,158
explain the truth about the case

253
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,470
clearly to him.

254
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,959
It's her.

255
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,350
She insisted she saw my son's body,

256
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,199
and even claimed she handed him to us.

257
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,438
But we've never even seen her!

258
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,670
Exactly!

259
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,959
What I said was,

260
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,158
I gave the body to his parents.

261
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,278
I never said it was you two.

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,278
You see?

263
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,558
That's utter nonsense!

264
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,199
Nonsense?

265
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,670
If you can't explain it,

266
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,310
then take us there.

267
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,070
Fine. Let's go.

268
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,278
You

269
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,670
sure it's this place?

270
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,319
Yes, this is it.

271
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,438
See for yourself.

272
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,079
That middle-aged couple was right here.

273
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,190
Two lanterns too.

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,389
So you're saying

275
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,959
the woman accepted Shuang here,

276
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,550
and gave you joy money?

277
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,109
What else could it be?

278
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,109
Madam.

279
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,950
Master.

280
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,789
All the talismans are gone.

281
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,350
Master...

282
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:44,909
What did that woman look like?

283
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,070
What did she look like?

284
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,199
Long hair,

285
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,359
a bit taller than me,

286
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,319
really pale face,

287
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,670
and thick lips.

288
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,350
What a tragedy...

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,359
Madam...

290
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,749
Let's go inside first.

291
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,869
Such a tragedy.

292
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,789
Look at the way they act.

293
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,398
If they weren't hiding something,

294
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,470
would they be like this?

295
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,199
Enough with the nonsense.

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,190
Get inside.

297
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,638
The talismans...

298
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,230
They're all gone.

299
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,518
Where's Shuang?

300
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,719
Where are the people you saw?

301
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,558
Mr. Yu,

302
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,909
please calm down.

303
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,950
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

304
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,678
You're covering for her!

305
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,590
I'm going to report you to the Director!

306
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,830
- Master!
- Master!

307
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,798
Look!

308
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,999
I told you I wasn't lying.

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,509
All this stuff is here!

310
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,359
She...

311
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,629
She gave me the money from this cabinet!

312
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,629

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,800

314
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,000
