Master...

19
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,518
It's true.

20
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,229
That girl came back for revenge.

21

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,229

24
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,518
Wasn't Meng Lin's ghost

26
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,509
by the Taoist priest?

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,069
How could she still marry Shuang?

28
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,509
What the priest feared has come true.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,669
Meng Lin has turned into a "Zhan".
[*A powerful and malevolent spirit]

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,989
What does that mean?

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,478
When a person dies,

32
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,030
they become a ghost.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,989
When a ghost dies again,
it becomes a "Zhan".

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,069
If it turns into a Zhan,

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,590
even the ghost wardens can't touch it.

36
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,878
Rubbish.

37
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,310
Stop spouting nonsense.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,158
It's not from me.

39
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,430
It's from the books.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,310
Mr. Yu.

41
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,430
Let's go over this carefully.

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,710
This Meng Lin you mentioned.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,829
Who is she?

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,799
Originally,

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,910
she was a child bride
raised in our household.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,999
But later, due to misconduct,

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,870
I kicked her out a few years ago.

48
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,679
Shuang was kindhearted.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,350
He saw she had nowhere to go,

50
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,069
so he gave her

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,350
this courtyard.

52
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,559
But later,

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,949
somehow,

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,870
we heard

55
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,829
her whole family
hanged themselves in this house.

56
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,320
Their bodies were already rotting
when they were found.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,318
(Happiness)

58
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,718
(Spirit tablets)
The whole family was picked clean

59
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,030
by wild dogs nearby.

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,710
Mr. Detective.

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,438
That undertaker...

62
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,279
She's shady, filled with dark energy.

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,359
It must be her.

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,638
Her yin aura

65
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,279
turned Meng Lin into a Zhan

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,630
and caused my son's sudden death!

67
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,239
All the warding talismans
we placed in the house,

68
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,638
they're all gone!

69
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,310
I understand how you feel,

70
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,038
but you need to calm down.

71
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,150
I don't believe in ghosts or gods.

72
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,509
I believe in evidence.

73
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,069

74
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,438

76

driven by love and hate,
claims young life!

77
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,519
Who came up with this story?

78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,389
It's so ridiculously dramatic.

79
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,910
Old man,

80
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,638
go home after you finish eating.

81
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,598
I already told you

82
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,598
in the yard,

83
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,559
don't worry about me.

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,190
I can handle this on my own.

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,989
Can I not worry?

86
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,949
Told you to stay put,

87
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,229
and you just had to disobey
and prove yourself.

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,789
Regret it now?

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,310
I don't.

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,870
Whatever kind of ghost it is.

91
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,598
It picked the wrong person.

92
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,478
Don't even think about blaming me

93
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,038
for the missing body.

94
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,959

Rumor has it

128
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,039
you broke off Meng Lin

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,749
That's nonsense!

132
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,319
It was Meng Lin who disgraced herself,
got involved with another man.

133
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,198
That's why I broke off the engagement.

was your former servant.
