Detective Yang.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,109
Detective Yang, I'm here.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,870
Are you two all right?

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,559
Uh, um...

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:31,958
Well then,

19
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,270
I'll go check outside.

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,589
Go.

21
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,510
You two,

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,710
dug up a grave,

23
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,038
disturbed a corpse.

24
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,999
One had a shovel,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,109
the other a spade.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,838
Our groundskeeper

27
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,669
saw the whole thing.

28
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,949
Detective Yang,

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,920
didn't you promise me you wouldn't let
what happened to the Yu family's son

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,318
happen to us?

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,189
Didn't you?

32
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:01,879
And what?

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,589
My daughter Shanshan rise from the dead.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,318
And now,

35
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,639
you're digging up her grave

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,159
and desecrating her remains?

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,869
What the hell are you trying to do?

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,399
Mr. He, what happened with
the rise from the dead

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,350
was a misunderstanding.

40
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,109
This time another misunderstanding too.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,920
By the time we got there, someone
had already tampered with the body.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,879
I saw it,

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,070
the cuts were made by a blade.

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,959
Neither my shovel nor Xiaojiu's spade

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,869
could have caused those wounds.

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,159
We dug up the grave

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,038
to uncover the truth.

48
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,790
To let He Shanshan rest in peace.

49
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,590
Enough!

50
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,910
That's enough shouting.

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,949
What is this, a marketplace?

52
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,839
You call this an investigation?

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,159
Who do you think you are,

54
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,119
coming to our police station
to investigate?

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,109
No...

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,198
Do you seriously

57
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,269
not get it?

58
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,358
Without your meddling,

59
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:47,310
this case would've
been solved centuries ago!

60
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,690
(Dragon Town Police Station.
Autopsy Report)

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,869
The coroner
has already examined the body.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,399
He Shanshan's corpse

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,839
was desecrated

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,429
around 9 PM last night.

65
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,638
How do

66
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,030
you explain that?

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,518
Director.

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,598
Do you remember

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,518
last night I called you
a useless director

70
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,949
and said I could do your job better?

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,399
Here you go again.

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,198
Believe it or not...

73
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,910
That's not the point.

74
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,269
The point is,

75
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,750
it was already 8 PM when I said it.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,038
We left the city

77
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,959
and that takes at least an hour.

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,190
Add in the time
it took to dig up the grave,

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,598
go back and forth...

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,389
There's no way we had time.

81
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,159
Director,

82
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,669
you're actually our alibi.

83
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,790
Mr. He,

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,030
aren't you suspicious?

85
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,918
The person who broke
into your home last time

86
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,399
wasn't the reporter.

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,829
It was someone else.

88
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,549
They ransacked your house first,

89
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,358
then

90
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,510
went to the graveyard.

91
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,109
So...

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,518
that person

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,798
wasn't Liao Sheng?

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,590
Then what were they looking for?

95
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,829
They did that

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,439
to my daughter.

97
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,590
I can tell you,

98
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,030
the people who dug up the grave

99
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,959
are the real killers behind all this.

100
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,679
Not the ghost bride.

101
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,669
We've already got their trail.

102
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,989
Give us a bit more time.

103
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,790
We'll give you an answer.

104
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,269
Yang Ziqi.

105
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,549
You've got six days.

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,869
I need to find a way to get the director
out of the way for a bit.

107
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,710
You finally get it.

108
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,549
Detective Yang.

109
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:30,749
Detective Yang.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,109
You were right.

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,470
Take a look.

112
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,109
What's this?

113
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,610
(Bank withdrawal receipt)

114
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,119
This is the receipt from the day

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,150
He Shanshan
withdrew money from the bank.

116
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,869
My contact at the bank told me,

117
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,318
on the day she died,

118
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,398
He Shanshan had planned
to leave Dragon Town.

119
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,549
She bought a train ticket
and was going to flee overnight.

120
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,629
So those travel permits and
the Good Citizen Certificate, they all line up.

121
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,278
She must've read those papers
from the past few days. She knew she was next.

122
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,629
So she tried to run.

123
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,919
Looks like

124
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,638
we'll have to go back
to He Shanshan's paper.

125
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,590
Check it again.

126
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,278
Your leg...

127
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,710
Maybe you should stay here.

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,429
We'll take you to the hospital first.

129
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,109
I get it.

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,799
Fixing my leg is a small matter.

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,749
Solving the case is more important.

132
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,958
All right then.

133
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,318
We'll take you up on that.

134
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,910
We'll borrow your car too.

135
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,950
Appreciate it.

136
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,479
I...

137
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,710
I was just being polite.

138
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,958
You could've at least left me the car!

139
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,309
Thirty percent of that limp was real.
Seventy percent was fake.

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,800
It shows. One moment it's his left leg,
the next it's his right.

141
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,010
(Hunan Province

142
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,830

144
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,030
Look.

145
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,390
Same theatre ticket.

146
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,239
There's no theatre
like this in Dragon Town.

147
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,078
Where is this place?

148
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,030
There isn't?

149
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,509
Never heard of it.

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,278
Since we know
they're looking for something

151
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,318
and I've seen
that pale-faced man before.

152
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,198
Then we can use this ticket stub
to bait out the one behind all this.

153
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,950
Maybe that pale-faced man himself.

154
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,749
We'll bait them.

155
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,509
But not we, just me.

156
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,830
Me alone.

157
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,830
Are you an idiot, Yang Ziqi?

Trying to ditch your partner again.

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,869
Using people when you need them
and tossing them when you don't.

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,398
If they really believe

161
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,039
I'm holding a key piece of evidence,

162
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,350
they'll come after me.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,429
If you get caught up in it,

164
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,030
it'll be dangerous.

165
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,359
Then that's all the more reason
I can't let you go alone.

166
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,230
It's better to share the risk
than to take it alone.

167
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,239
You're so annoying.

168
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,629
Stop messing around.
