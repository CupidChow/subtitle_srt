=Episode 10=

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,918
I told you to come find me

14
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:50,190
as soon as the paper was out.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,550
You just ignored me, didn't you?

16
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,470
I'm fine now.

17
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:55,638
I had a good sleep.

18
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,269
Do you have any new leads?

19
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,190
East side of town.

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,190
A corpse herder was found dead.

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,109
What?

22
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:09,838
Don't scare yourself just yet.

23
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:11,309
It might be someone else.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,519
In all of Dragon Town,

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,598
only my master herded corpses
when he was young.

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,159
Besides,

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,038
the note he left me the other day said

28
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,829
he'd be taking that exact road.

29
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:21,398
Come on, you've got a car.

30
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:22,630
Take me there, quick.

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:23,630
Let's go.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,189
Do you want me to confirm it for you?

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,429
Old man.

34
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,910
Stop messing about.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,389
I really will get angry.

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,869
Master.

37
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,190
Master.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,149
Master.

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,590
Master.

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,869
Master.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,989
Master.

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,630
(Marks from a tent.)

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,190
(Could it be the Commanding Officer's troops
arrived early?)

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,790
(These bullets aren't
from the Commanding Officer's troops.)

45
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,038
(Could it be)

46
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,910
(there's another force nearby?)

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,070
If I find out

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,429
who did this to my master,

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,709
I swear I'll kill them.

50
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,549
I swear I'll kill them!

51
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,638
Master,

52
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,350
I've brought you home.

53
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,749
Leave him here.

54
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,069
But...

55
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,189
Xiaojiu...

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,790
You two go on. I...

57
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,198
I want to spend a moment alone

58
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,590
with my master.

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,629
What the hell.

60
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,189
You thought you could be my master?

61
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,019
(Pawnshop)

62
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,339
(Dragon Town)

63
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,179
(Newspaper Office)

64
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,250
(Linjiangxian Theater)

65
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,610
(Admission Ticket)

66
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,198
Liu.

67
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,679
Yes.

68
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,119
Get the car ready.
I'm going to Yu Shuang and Yuan Bin.

69
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,669
All right, Detective Yang.

70
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,290
(Admission Ticket)

71
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,730
(Admission Ticket)

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,989
Master!

73
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,910
Luo Luo.

74
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,479
What on earth is going on?

75
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,838
Good thing I knew it wasn't you.

76
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,590
Do you know how worried I was?

77
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,189
That night,

78
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,109
a strange person came looking for me.

79
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,150
They asked me
to take a corpse out of town.

80
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,549
This person

81
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,109
came at night,

82
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,230
acting all secretive.

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,270
Master Jiu.

84
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,239
It's urgent.

85
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,030
We'd like to trouble you tonight to help us
transport something out of town.

86
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,109
Sir,

87
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,758
this is a funeral parlor,

88
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,150
not a security bureau.

89
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,398
Have you got the wrong place?

90
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,518
Master Long Jiu,

91
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,559
forty years ago, you were
a famed corpse herder in Xiangxi.

92
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,679
Only you

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,799
can help us

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,910
get this out safely tonight.

95
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,838
You've got the wrong person.

96
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,958
Master Jiu,

97
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,318
this concerns whether Xiaojiu

98
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,830
can find Yu Shuang's body.

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,910
I had refused at first,

100
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,718
but then

101
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,039
he brought up

102
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,830
the strange things
you've been dealing with lately.

103
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,239
So

104
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,590
I decided to take the job.

105
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,710
Maybe,

106
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,318
he was telling the truth.

107
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,239
I might find something that can help you

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,590
with Yu Shuang's case.

109
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,069
What was I transporting?

110
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:12,869
Him.

111
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,470
He'll pretend to be a corpse

112
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,480
and you'll take him
to the old village outside town.

113
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,509
Once you get there,
someone will contact you.

114
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,069
Then Xiaojiu's name would be cleared.

115
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,710
But after I left Dragon Town,

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,669
I noticed something.

117
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,749
There were marks left behind
by patrolling soldiers nearby.

118
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,629
Soldiers?

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,350
What kind of soldiers?

120
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,789
Who else could it be?

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,989
The infamous Security Regiment.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,119
And what's more,

123
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,550
they had the whole town surrounded.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,798
Good heavens.

125
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,398
Good thing, a very good thing,
that when we herd corpses,

126
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,070
we always switch identities.

127
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,029
Otherwise...

128
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,989
That was a lucky escape.

129
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,518
Master Jiu,

130
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,398
what now?

131
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,350
It feels like someone's onto us.

132
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,470
A hidden sentry

133
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,079
shot the person I was meant to escort,

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,509
thinking I was the corpse instead.

135
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,230
That's the only reason
I had a chance to fight back and escape.

136
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,479
I swapped clothes with him

137
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,710
and disguised him

138
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,869
to look like me.

139
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,959
The soldiers who came
after hearing the gunshots

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,079
took a paper from the shoe

141
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,950
of the person I was escorting.

142
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,670
I didn't get a clear look.

143
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,149
But I think it was a map.

144
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,909
And then?

145
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,070
And then...

146
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,230
I followed them all the way

147
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,909
and saw that the map

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,070
ended up in the hands of the
Security Regiment commander, Li Dazui.

149
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,509
But there was someone else there.

150
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,509
Very suspicious.

151
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,119
And Li Dazui

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,590
was incredibly respectful to him.

153
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,430
For a commander

154
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,430
to act so deferential...

155
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,230
What sort of man must he be?

156
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,230
Li Dazui's the type
to bow to whoever pays.

157
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,479
If you pay enough,

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,509
he'll kneel without blinking.

159
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,230
But that man,

160
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,269
I didn't see his full face.

161
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,869
It was very pale.

162
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,389
Not the usual kind of pale.

163
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,350
Could it be...

164
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,719
Master, do you remember

165
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,999
what that man who came to see you

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,389
that night looked like?

167
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,470
A tall, skinny young man.

168
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,470
Thick eyebrows.

169
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,029
Wore glasses.

170
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,319
He looked

171
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,029
quite proper and well-mannered.
