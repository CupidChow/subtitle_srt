The ghost who died
at the hands of the Yu family.

That ghost has killed someone.

Master Yuan was killed by the police.

Someone help!

you provide the story.

I'm Liao Sheng.

Owner of Liao Press.

58
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,771
I make a living selling stories.

Got any good ones for sale?

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,600

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,920
(Cold-faced detective and funeral girl)
your story with Detective Yang.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,250
That one really interests me.

63
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,420
People say

64
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,619
our line of work

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,739
is the lowest among
all trades and professions.

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,739
You're the first one

67
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,930
to write about us funeral folks.

68
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,491
To make us the main characters.

69
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,051
Think it through.

70
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,211
The story
about Yu Shuang and the child bride,

71
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:58,810
that was his work.

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,491
Yu Shuang.

73
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,650
Yu Shuang has been dead for three days.

74
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,530
They still haven't found the body.

75
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,380
And Master Yuan,

76
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,130
his death was far too strange.

77
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,530
Master Yuan?

78
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,540
How did he die?

79
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,810
Does it have

80
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,100
something to do with the Zhan?

81
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,059
Stop spouting nonsense all day.

82
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,611
Ghosts, spells, dark magic...

83
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,220
That's police intel.

Classified information.

85
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,940
Burning bridges, Detective Yang?

86
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:26,171
That's not the attitude you had
when I saved your life.

87
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:27,731
Ignore him.

88
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,179
He's just bitter about

89
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,420
being framed.

90
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,810
If I really was the killer,

91
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,690
you'd be an accomplice.

92
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:35,451
We're in the same boat now.

93
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,731
No one's getting off.

94
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,200
Who are you calling a bug on a boat?

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,331
Your whole family's bugs.

96
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,051
Sorry about that.

97
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,850
Right.

98
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,171
Back there, you said,

99
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,410
"Who was it?"

100
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,619
What did you see?

101
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,540
I saw

102
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,100
a pale-faced freak

103
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,771
in Master Yuan's room.

104
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,451
Creepy as hell.

105
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,420
But,

106
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,459
I'm sure

107
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,130
I've seen him before.

108
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,731
Interesting.

109
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,930
I've got a feeling,

110
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,370
the fox is showing its tail.

111
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,939
Didn't I tell you

112
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,610
to stay away from the station for now?

113
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,340
It's late and dark.
If I'm not scared, why are you?

114
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:45,420
You and your friend

115
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:46,900
turned the whole station upside down.

116
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,699
Utter chaos.

117
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,410
From the director to the rookie cops,
no one wants to see you here.

118
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,340
And you're in the funeral trade.

119
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,840
If you keep showing up at the station,
what will the public think?

120
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,699
Just this once.

121
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,850
Don't make it a habit.

122
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,179
We'll talk about next time
when it comes.

123
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,379
First, tell me

124
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,020
any progress on the pale-faced freak?

125
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,530
Any new leads?

126
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,860
The pale-faced freak...

127
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,251
Nothing for now.

128
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,891
But we've made a bigger discovery.

129
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,980
Shopkeeper Wang and Yu Shuang.

130
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,220
He Shanshan and Yuan Bin.

131
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,451
Two separate cases

132
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,850
but there's a pattern.

133
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,700
(Domicile Certificate, Yu Shuang)
Did you notice?

134
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,791
(Domicile Certificate, He Shanshan)

135
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,050
I've got it.

136
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,280
The number of strokes
in their surnames is increasing.

137
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,571
No.

138
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,179
It's the fox behind the scenes

139
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,499
starting to slip up.

140
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,050
Whether it's Shopkeeper Wang
or Yu Shuang,

141
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,980
the cases looked airtight.

142
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,490
As if done by malicious spirits.

143
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,251
No witnesses,

144
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,050
so people believe whatever they hear.

145
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,179
But as we kept digging,

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,619
they started rushing to kill again.

147
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,499
And so,

148
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,011
things got sloppy.

149
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,340
First, Wu Qingzhi
broke in on He Shanshan.

150
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,100
Then right after,

151
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:02,179
we barged in on Yuan Bin.

152
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,780
And even

153
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,691
you saw that man.

154
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:06,580
So basically,

155
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:07,340
our investigation

156
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,251
is heading in the right direction.

157
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,259
He Shanshan's final words before death

158
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,530
was the key.

159
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:13,460
Which means...

160
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,580
Killing He Shanshan

161
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:16,739
was to silence that last sentence.

162
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,699
Then what about
Yuan Bin, the Master Yuan?

163
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,090
What were they covering up?

164
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,660
They were covering up

165
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,980
that mysterious man
and woman who rented the house.

166
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:24,891
Exactly.

167
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,660
That's the real reason behind

168
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,170
Yuan Bin, the Master Yuan's deaths.

169
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:30,900
Director.

170
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:32,211
Why are you here?

171
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,290
Let go.

172
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,050
Director.

173
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:37,410
Director.

174
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,811
Let go.

175
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,170
Get out of my way.

176
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,379
Yang Ziqi.

177
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,410
Look at the mess you've made.

178
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,410
Tell me,

179
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,530
what happened at Yutang House?

180
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:49,619
Do you even realise

181
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,900
the entire city is talking

182
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,530
about the police killing someone?

183
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:54,340
From now on,

184
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:55,619
you stay put.

185
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,490
- You're not going anywhere.
- That was a setup, I didn't kill anyone.

186
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,891
I don't care if it was a setup
or a misunderstanding.

187
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,139
Have I ever told you

188
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,290
these things are cursed?

189
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,980
We should've kept it quiet and simple.

190
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,931
Let sleeping dogs lie.

191
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,771
But you had to dig to the bottom.

192
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:13,739
And now look.

193
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,011
Each death is stranger than the last.

194
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,371
I'm not afraid to tell you,

195
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,850
right now,

196
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,220
not just the Deputy Mayor's
unhappy with you.

197
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,610
Even the Chief Bailiff
and Commissioner Li

198
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,331
have come to complain about you.

199
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,540
Didn't you promise He Shanshan's father

200
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,131
that nothing would happen?

201
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,499
And yet,

202
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,891
something still happened
to He Shanshan at our station.

203
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:39,050
The station!

204
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,290
That's where it happened!

205
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,420
I've already decided,

206
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,530
her body
has been returned to her family.

207
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,699
This case

208
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,891
is closed.

209
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,290
What are you doing?

210
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,691
Show some respect.

211
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,090
Be serious!

212
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,259
As for the missing body
of the Young Master Yu,

213
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,299
just blame it on that damn funeral girl.

214
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,850
Let her deal with it herself.

215
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,299
What kind of lousy director are you?

216
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,811
If you're not doing the job, I will.

217
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,850
- Watch your mouth!
- Director.

218
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,530
When I came here,

219
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,090
I gave the Commanding Officer my word,

220
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:24,410
every case would be investigated,
every murder solved.

221
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:25,891
I will not

222
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,530
drop this case.

223
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,850
Let's go, Yang Ziqi.

224
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:31,739
Ignore him.

225
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,331
- We'll investigate on our own.
- You...

226
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,730
You two...

227
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,331
Back there...

228
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,931
Thanks.

229
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,531
Now you know why I didn't want you here.

230
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,811
I just want to find out the truth.

231
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,490
Maybe then we can find Yu Shuang's body.

232
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,730
I'll have Liu keep looking

233
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,531
into Yu Shuang's trail in Dragon Town.

234
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,659
That pale-faced freak,

235
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,970
he's our breakthrough.

236
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,890
If they're so desperate to cover it up,

237
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,291
then what exactly
did they want from He Shanshan?

238
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,539
Luo Luo said the bug on her

239
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,130
went wild like crazy.

240
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,820
Something about her

241
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,691
is definitely not right.

242
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:23,271
(Garrison Office, Dragon Town)

243
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,090
You're not sleeping?

244
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,051
At Liao Press, top to bottom,

245
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,539
it's just me.

246
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,659
If I go to sleep,

247
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,890
there's no news.

248
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,019
Detective Yang,

249
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,820
we had a deal.

250
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:38,019
I give you leads,

251
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,259
you tell me something.

252
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,379
Otherwise how can I help?

253
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,259
Right?

254
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,250
Xiaojiu.

255
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:48,779
It was

256
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,940
just holding hands.

257
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:51,659
I change clothes
for male corpses all the time

258
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,779
when I work funeral jobs.

259
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,259
Wash the body and everything.

260
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,619
And you, a grown man

261
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,899
acting so squeamish.

262
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,940
No wonder
you can't find anything on your own.

263
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,300
Don't mind him, Liao Sheng.

264
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,770
He's way too uptight.

265
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:04,860
So, you two,

266
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,171
what's next?

267
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,331
Where to?

268
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,490
Who did this?

269
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,531
Just as we thought.

270
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,250
Looks like the person behind this

271
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,331
still hasn't found what they're after.

272
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,051
They ransacked everything.

273
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,820
They must be looking

274
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,610
for something on paper.

275
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,451
I get it now.

276
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,451
It must be

277
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,619
the ghost bride coming back to get

278
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,820
He Shanshan's money

279
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:17,340
to raise Yu Shuang,

280
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,770
who she stole from her.

281
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,451
Oh, right.

282
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,571
I forgot to ask.

283
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,811
How did you know

284
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,331
the He family wasn't home today?

285
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,940
Told you already.

286
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,340
There's nothing in Dragon Town
I don't know.

287
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:31,419
Their cook
didn't order a single dish today.

288
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,090
That means no one's home.

289
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,010
We're screwed.

290
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,700
You two stay here.

291
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:54,691
I'll take the heat.

292
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,019
Don't.

293
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,739
We don't sell out our friends.

294
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,460
You two already met
the Yu family parents.

295
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,490
If they see you again now, it's over.

296
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:03,259
Don't worry.

297
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,531
I could talk a corpse back to life.

298
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:06,659
I'll stall them.

299
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,370
You find a chance and run.

300
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,580
Who are you?

301
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:20,580
Hey, thief!

302
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:21,730
Hold on.

303
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,899
I'm not a thief.

304
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,451
Then who are you?

305
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,940
Liao Sheng from Liao Press.
Here for an interview

306
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,100
about the ghost bride

307
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,779
and the case of murder
and husband-snatching.

308
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,051
What's your opinion on that?

309
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:40,531
Beat him!

310
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,090
Wait, no!

311
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,811
He Shanshan.

312
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,010
We dug up your grave today

313
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,051
to find the truth for you.

314
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,331
We mean no harm.

315
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,931
Forgive us.

316
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,090
Don't you not believe in ghosts?

317
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:03,370
Who are you talking to?

318
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,211
To myself.

319
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:07,970
For peace of mind?

320
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,051
To stay calm.

321
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,610
Let's open the coffin.

322
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,370
If the reapers want her dead,

323
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,571
she won't live past midnight.

324
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,571
This...

325
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,890
Old Wu once said

326
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,610
whatever Master Eight promises,

327
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:33,970
no matter

328
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,820
where you run,

329
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,770
even to the underworld itself,

330
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:38,970
Master Eight

331
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,691
will come and take your life.

332
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,610
Hey!

333
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,619
Thief!

334
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,770
Someone's stealing a corpse!

335
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,130
Someone's stealing a corpse!

336
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:52,300
Open up!

337
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,619
I already told you,

338
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,499
he's a detective!

339
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,419
Yang Ziqi!

340
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,130
You've got the wrong guy!

341
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,340
I'm the Grand Marshal, remember?
Chill out.

342
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:00,770
Just wait for the police.

343
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,571
Nonsense!

344
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:04,490
Save your breath.

345
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,651
Liu will come rescue us soon.

346
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,931
Then let's focus on the clues.

347
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,331
I suspect

348
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,331
the one who cut He Shanshan open,

349
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,610
and the one who killed her

350
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,139
right before Old Wu got there

351
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,610
are the same person.

352
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:27,490
At the very least,

353
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,010
part of the same group.

354
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,051
How so?

355
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,211
I'm worried

356
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,931
they've already found what they wanted.

357
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,090
If that's true,

358
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,100
then everything we've worked for,

359
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,171
every lead we have

360
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,051
could vanish in an instant.

361
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,490
So,

362
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,651
whatever it is, it must be small.

363
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,171
Otherwise, they wouldn't have assumed
He Shanshan swallowed it.

364
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,890
What could it be?

365
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,770
Something simple enough

366
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,211
that she could say it
to Wu Qingzhi before dying.

367
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,730
It can't be anything complicated.

368
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,171
And small enough to swallow.

369
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,250
A note.

370
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:14,890
But the contents,
you can't fit all that in one sentence.

371
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,291
A code?

372
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,730
No,

373
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,010
that's unlikely.

374
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:31,730
Don't freeze to death.

375
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,490
Or I'll end up the prime suspect again.

376
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,811
Ugh, smells like horse piss again.

377
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,820
My legs are cold too.

378
