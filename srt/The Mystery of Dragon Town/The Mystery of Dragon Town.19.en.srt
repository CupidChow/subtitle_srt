Xiaojiu.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,558
It's safe.

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:56,759
Drop the act already,

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,958
you darn thing.

20
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,589
I'll teach you a lesson!

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,989
How come it's you?

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,038
What did you try to move

23
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,990
by pretending to be corpse herders?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,949
Did Sui Wen tell you to do so?

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,230
Who's Sui Wen?

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:13,749
Search.

27
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,389
This is opium.

28
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:52,799
Well,

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,559
where's the venue for your deal?

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,389
Say it!

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,469
It's... It's right here.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,590
That's Sui Wen.

33
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,679
I'll go after him.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,630
You keep an eye on them.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,630
Don't move.

36
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,949
Where's he?

37
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,989
Did you lose him?

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,470
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,999
Forget it.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,598
Let's see if we can get

41
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,070
something out of those men.

42
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,230
What's it?

43
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,549
I could've got him.

44
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,478
But I saw him

45
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,989
leaving in a car.

46
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,190
And I saw that car before.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,310
It belongs to the deputy mayor.

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,109
Deputy Mayor Tian?

49
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,198
But...

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,230
But

51
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,910
he ever saved my master's life.

52
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,269
Besides, hasn't he been
solving the opium problem with us?

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,190
Why is he now in cahoots with Sui Wen?

54
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,630
I'm not sure either.

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,869
This is bad.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,470
Where's Liao Sheng?

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,638
Would he and Luoluo

58
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,030
fall into their trap by returning to the city
and reporting it?

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,600
Let's head back to the city first.

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,429
This is a serious matter, so I need to inform
the Commanding Officer of it.

61
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,030
Master!

62
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,510
Are you alright, Master?

63
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,750
Master!

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,269
Luoluo?

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,078
You're all here.
Thank God all of you are fine.

66
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,709
Why are you so panic?

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,109
What's happened?

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,879
Luoluo.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,470
Have you seen Deputy Mayor Tian?

70
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,518
When we rushed to his place last night,

71
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,760
there was no one there.

72
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,100
That Liao told me to come back
and told Master Jiu about it.

73
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,359
He said he'd be writing his report
at the newspaper office.

74
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,719
What's the progress over there?

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
Have you found out anything
about the Soul Grass?

76
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,429
Not at all.

77
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,750
But we caught a group
of fake corpse herders.

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,989
They were moving the opium
using a dead body.

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,590
What?

80
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,069
Their leader

81
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,718
is that bearded man

82
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,350
we saw at the inn.

83
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,790
And their contact person

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,669
is Deputy Mayor Tian.

85
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:29,669
- What?
- Huh?

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,590
That Liao...

87
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,270
Oh no.

88
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,599
Yang Ziqi, oh, Yang Ziqi.

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,470
Thank God I came back sooner.

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,989
Look what you've done
these past few days.

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,239
Why?

92
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,679
Are you tired of living?

93
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,270
If yes, just leave!

94
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,189
Sir,

95
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,109
I suggest to issue a warrant
to get the deputy mayor arrested.

96
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,559
Because he's colluded
with the Medicine King Valley,

97
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,718
making him

98
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,989
the mastermind of the opium business
in Dragon Town?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,869
Well...

100
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,509
How about the ghost murderer's case?

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,039
It's all his follower's doing.

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,509
His name is Sui Wen.

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,520
We've had the solid evidence.

104
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,679
If we arrest Tian Zhen, we will force him
to tell us about Sui Wen's whereabouts.

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,919
Well,

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,198
that's easier said

107
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,629
than done.

108
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,429
He's powerful and influential.

109
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,509
If we make a mistake

110
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,718
or

111
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,629
it ends up becoming a misunderstanding,

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,359
you will lose your job.

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,669
But I don't want lose mine!

114
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,230
Fine.

115
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,200
Since you're giving up on this opportunity
to make a great contribution,

116
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,069
I'll wait for the Commanding Officer.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,150
What do you mean?

118
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,000
The Commanding Officer
is already in Lin County.

119
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,239
To tell you the truth,

120
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,158
I'm here

121
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,398
to investigate the mastermind

122
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,359
behind Dragon Town's drug problem,
on his order.

123
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,439
Looks like

124
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,710
it's your wish to talk to him in person.

125
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,109
Hold on!

126
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,429
Get back here.

127
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,309
Stop right there.

128
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,278
Detective Yang.

129
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,078
How could you suspect me?

130
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,429
Everything I've done,
it's for the sake of this town.

131
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,078
You can't just search my house

132
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,950
for no reason.

133
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,958
Pardon me,

134
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,119
Deputy Mayor.

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,989
Search!

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,869
Search!

137
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,010
(Case File)

138
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,579

139
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,179

Yang Ziqi.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,069
Come check this out!

143
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,439
(Baishan Chamber of Commerce)
As expected, this Deputy Mayor Tian

144
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,189
is in charge
of Baishan Chamber of Commerce.

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,919
No.

146
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,350
It's Mayor Tian.

147
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,198
Wait.

148
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,838
You...

149
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,158
You gave me the fright of my life.

150
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,549
Why were you close to me?

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,309
Didn't you ask me to come here?

152
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,958
Sir,

153
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,830
we've found a large quantity of opium!

154
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,278
Well...

155
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,390
I'll keep searching it.

156
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,758
Sir,

157
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,710
it's all here.

158
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,198
I bet this is the same batch

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,069
as the one found in the theater.

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,999
Mayor Tian.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,790
What else do you have to say?

162
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,398
Detective Yang,

163
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,309
I never thought

164
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,030
you're good

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,749
at framing the innocent.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
We've got nothing but concrete evidence here.

167
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,599
And there are many transaction details

168
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,109
of Baishan Chamber of Commerce
found in your study.

169
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,840
(Baishan Chamber of Commerce)
Are you still trying to deny it?

170
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,278
You think you can topple me down
with these documents and opium

171
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,679
of unknown origin?

172
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,309
In your dream.

173
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,269
How about Sui Wen?

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,830
How do you explain
him getting into your car?

175
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,389
Get him this man named Sui Wen, then.
We will ask him about it in person.

176
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,599
Miss Xiaojiu.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,798
Doesn't evidence matter the most?

178
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,398
You want evidence, huh?
I will make you admit to your crime.

179
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,190
I'll wait for you
to clear my name, Detective Yang.

180
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,918
Tell me. How about Liao Sheng?

181
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,590
He's been your follower
for all these years.

182
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,710
What has he been doing?

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,749
He's nothing but trivial.

184
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,629
Well,

185
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,959
he's just a minion of mine.

186
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,999
So,

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,038
do you have anything

188
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,070
to do with the Soul Grass?

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,070
I have no idea

190
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,869
what you're talking about.

191
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,638
I really didn't know the deputy mayor

192
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,070
had been secretly selling opium.

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,758
I swear. I'm not on his side.

194
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,629
Do you

195
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,749
believe me?

196
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,558
Enough.

197
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,918
You're not smart enough

198
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,310
for that.

199
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,269
What's this?

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,350
Is this

201
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,029
an apology?

202
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,918
I have myself to blame,
and I was wrong about him.

203
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,760
And I almost ended up
becoming his accomplice.

204
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,029
Hit me twice

205
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,470
to vent your anger.

206
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,109
You're nuts.

207
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,518
This is your only chance

208
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,719
to do so.

209
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,240
Don't you bring it up again after this.

210
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,430
Happy?

211
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,350
Thank you, Xiaojiu.

212
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,719
I feel much better now.

213
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,989
Alright.

214
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,029
Let's get back to business.

215
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,029
Though Mayor Tian has been caught,

216
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,079
apart from Sui Wen,

217
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,398
we know

218
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,599
nothing else

219
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,079
about Baishan Chamber of Commerce.

220
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,149
Moreover,

221
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,638
there's the Soul Grass.

222
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,719
I asked Mayor Tian,

223
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,310
but he said he was only aware

224
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,950
of the opium transactions.

225
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,470
Could it be

226
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,950
there's another powerful figure
in Dragon Town?

227
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,999
This is bad!

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,350
Mayor Tian took the car away!

229
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,909
Give chase!

230
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,678
Stop right there!

231
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,950
Stop!

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
The car is out of gas.

233
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,980
I bet he's gone into the woods
after being shot.

234
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,600
You search that area. I'll search there.
He won't get to run away.

235
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,190
Sure.

236
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,710
Yang Ziqi!

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,190
Yang Ziqi!

238
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,509
Yang Ziqi.

239
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,470
Are you alright?

240
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,629
What happened to him?

241
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,869
He tried to seize my gun.

242
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,629
I was left with no choice.

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,430
It's okay.

244
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,590
But it's a pity.

245
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,430
Xiaojiu.

246
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,470
Don't worry.

247
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,590
I will find you

248
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,670
Yu Shuang's body.

249
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,798
Well, I'll get down here.

250
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,678
You still need

251
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,989
to send Mayor Tian's body
to the police station.

252
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,029
I'll go see my master and Luoluo.

253
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,710
It's me.

254
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,989
Looks like things are getting serious.

255
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,430
Indeed.

256
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,219
Look at how upset she is.

257
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,726
(Deputy Mayor Caught Smuggling Opium)

258
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,650
(Detective Yang Upholds Justice,
Rooting Out Evil)

259
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,989
Stop reading it.

260
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,999
Anyway,

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,830
that's the story.

262
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,269
Got it?

263
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,719
Is the Security Regiment's new map

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,839
withe Detective Yang or Liao Sheng?

265
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,599
Whatever.

266
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,710
- You!
- Long Jiu!

267
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,109
Come out!

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,029
- Xiaojiu...
- I got it.

269
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,070
Go ahead.

270
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,350
Okay.

271
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,950
Here we go again.

272
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,239
Excuse me,

273
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,319
but who are you here for?

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Go and get your master!

275
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,590
- He's not around.
- He's dead.

276
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,869
- He's dead.
- He's not around.

277
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,470
Is he dead or just not around?

278
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,989
Tell us what you need him for.

279
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,479
Six months ago,

280
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,509
he handled our family funeral

281
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,310
and buried my precious grandson's body.

282
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,029
Apart from our family,

283
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,869
he's the only one
who knows about the burial spot.

284
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,479
Ours is a wealthy family.

285
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,319
Everything we eat, wear, and use

286
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,230
is custom made.

287
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,119
Every single item we own

288
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,989
is one of a kind.

289
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,269
Look what he's done.

290
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,789
My precious grandson's burial goods

291
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,749
are everywhere on the market.

292
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,509
Tell me!

293
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,239
Did he

294
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,599
collude with tomb robbers

295
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,509
and dig up my grandson's grave?

296
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,509
