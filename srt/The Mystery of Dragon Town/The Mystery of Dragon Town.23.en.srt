=Episode 23=

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,920
Nonsense.
I clearly saw a woman right here.

14
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,841
You're too obsessed with the fox spirit.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,959
It's fine.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,081
I was seeing things. Let's go.

17
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,640
- Let's go.
- Let's head back.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,761
Go on.

19
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:08,640
Candied hawthorn!

20
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:11,400
- Mr. Liao, aren't we leaving yet?
- Get your candied hawthorn here!

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,199
I'm starving.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,521
Let's get moving.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,759
Forget them.

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,800
We'll deliver it.

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:16,970
What's the rush?

26
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:17,679
I'll take one.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,840
You little brat.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,960
Just wait a bit.

29
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,839
Was this

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,881
all extracted from Soul Grass?

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,241
Guess how much it's worth?

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,801
At the very least,

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,680
three hundred taels of silver.

34
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,599
Three hundred catties of Soul Grass

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,039
to extract just this tiny bit.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,320
This little box alone is worth

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,641
forty small gold bars.

38
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:51,200
This oil

39
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,599
gets passed to the sellers

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,921
and then resold to the West.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
That profit

42
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,880
is way more than what we get.

43
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,479
You're already the mayor.

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,080
Why do you need the money?

45
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,560
The whole Dragon Town

46
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,920
isn't enough for you to plunder?

47
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,280
Well, don't forget

48
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,440
I have to split half of it
with Detective Yang.

49
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,919
If there's less money,

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,560
how do we divide it?

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,921
What time is it?

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,079
Eleven thirty.

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,400
Half an hour to midnight.

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,601
They should be here soon.

55
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,680
What are you doing here?

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,880
I was worried you'd kill Li Da.

57
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,641
I still need Yu Shuang's body.

58
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,241
Did the map get delivered?

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
No.

60
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,000
You...

61
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,280
Just kidding.

62
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,041
- Stop right there.
- Stop!

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,280
Notify your Commanding Officer.

64
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,680
I have urgent news.

65
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,801
(For the Commanding Officer of Xiangxi)
Letter from Yang Ziqi, his subordinate.

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,400
Why were you

67
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:06,560
on the second floor?

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,560
Wait for the signal.

69
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,641
Then...

70
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, right.

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,880
Rub this stinky ointment over yourself.

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,241
Don't tell me
this is your weird bug's poop.

73
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
Just do it. Quit whining.

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,601
It took me all afternoon
to gather the bug goo.

75
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,359
Now that we have this stuff,

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,560
why worry about getting rich
or promoted?

77
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,280
Detective Yang.

78
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,160
May I have a word
with the mayor in private?

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,521
Perfect timing.

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,799
The buyer, Ma Desheng,
is about to arrive.

81
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
Take a few men

82
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,201
and meet him at the gate.

83
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:01,641
What is it?

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,680
This...

85
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,560
What happened here?

86
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,281
She was shot to death.

87
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:21,040
The funeral girl's coffin

88
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,601
was empty.

89
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,880
Detective Yang fooled us.

90
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,281
Curse you, Yang Ziqi.

91
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,401
Bring him in.

92
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,801
Kill him.

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,920
Welcome, De.

94
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,319
Our boss has been waiting for you.

95
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,079
Hold on.

96
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
This way.

97
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,560
Hide the body first.

98
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,000
Follow my lead.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,281
Get rid of it.

100
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,120
Desheng,

101
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,600
it's been a while.

102
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,880
Congrats on winning
the election, Mr. Li.

103
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,079
From now on, Dragon Town will be

104
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
more prosperous than ever.

105
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:02,640
I'll be counting
on your support, Desheng.

106
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:07,199
But that last batch you sold me
almost killed someone.

107
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
My business relies on regulars.

108
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,000
If you pull this again,
we can't be partners.

109
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Desheng.

110
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,360
It's a new product after all.

111
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,959
It needs to be tested.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,040
With testing,

113
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,120
you're bound to have a few hiccups.

114
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,120
What matters is the result.

115
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,440
However,

116
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:27,560
I have high hopes for that Soul Grass

117
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,961
you mentioned last time.

118
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,719
If it lets me down,

119
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,961
you won't be walking out of here.

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,120
Don't worry, Desheng.

121
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:36,880
Once you try this batch,

122
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,639
even if someone died last time,

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,241
you won't even say a word of complaint.

124
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,481
Is that so?

125
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,440
Cross my heart.

126
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,560
I'm counting on you

127
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:48,241
to recommend me to Tang Jiyao.

128
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Why would I lie to you?

129
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on.

130
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:53,961
Let's go.

131
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,319
Is it cold in Xiangxi?

132
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,319
It's freezing.

133
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,721
Yunnan is better.

134
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,401
It's spring all year round.

135
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,000
If you want spring,

136
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,361
that's easy.

137
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,519
I'll send you to Fuchun House.

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,880
You can get all the pleasure
like it's springtime!

139
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
Nice.

140
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:27,841
This batch was just freshly refined.

141
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,560
Have you tested the effect?

142
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,920
Don't worry.

143
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,120
Of course we tested it.

144
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,000
Otherwise, how would we dare
sell it to you?

145
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,640
Careful.

146
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,680
Too much of it can kill.

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,481
Boss.

148
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,440
That is incredible.

149
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,361
Much better than opium paste.

150
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,200
This is solid.

151
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,519
Mr. Li,

152
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,000
this batch of Soul Grass

153
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,800
is a total success.

154
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,200
Deal.

155
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,279
Well?

156
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,041
We're gonna strike it rich together.

157
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:50,401
Great.

158
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,961
Let's get rich together.

159
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,279
What's going on?

160
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,320
The light's out!

161
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:28,759
Fireworks?

162
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,680
Up there.

163
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:30,880
Who's setting off fireworks?

164
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,120
So beautiful.

165
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,039
Come on, get up.

166
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,120
Get up, kids.

167
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,039
It's your time to shine.

168
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,720
Remember,

169
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,200
shout out the name of the Liao Press.

170
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:38,679
Got it?

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,279
Got it!

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,039
Go!

173
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,600
Newspapers! Get your newspapers!

174
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,120
- Liao Press here!
- Liao Press here!

175
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:47,640
The mastermind has been revealed!

176
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,081
Mayor Li Da's plot exposed!

177
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,760
Get your paper! Liao Press!

178
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,280
Yang Ziqi!

179
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,320
You...

180
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,840
You set me up!

181
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:13,279
You...

182
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,600
I should kill you!

183
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,639
It's safe now.

184
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,800
Come on out.

185
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,241
Whoa.

186
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,399
My goodness, Luo.

187
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,399
You're a real weapon
of mass destruction!

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,519
Yang Ziqi!

189
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,201
You'll regret this!

190
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,360
Yang Ziqi!

191
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,441
You...

192
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,920
You...

193
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,519
Who are you?

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,439
Who are you?

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,520
Shut up.

196
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,480
Keep still.

197
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:41,601
I'll give you the antidote.

198
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,000
Otherwise, you'd be dead by dawn.

199
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:45,321
Desheng,

200
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,000
don't listen to his nonsense.

201
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,279
Don't worry.

202
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
I'm here.

203
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,640
You'll be fine.

204
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,320
Yang Ziqi,

205
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,720
do you know
the consequences of arresting me?

206
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:55,720
Do you really think

207
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,561
you'll walk out that door alive?

208
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:14,399
Mayor Li Da accused
of heinous murders

209
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,880
and illicit tobacco trade.

210
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,441
Such crimes are unforgivable.

211
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,361
Exclusive coverage by Liao Press.

212
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:20,880
Mayor Li Da,

213
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,880
the whole town knows now

214
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,400
what you've done.

215
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:25,559
We have concrete evidence.

216
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,559
Do you think

217
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,241
anyone can save your skin?

218
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,841
I dare you...

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,720
to get me out of here!

220
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,561
Do you even understand the situation?

221
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
Are you waiting
for Li Dazui to save you?

222
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:39,080
You...

223
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:40,241
What do you mean by that?

224
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,561
The Peace Preservation Corps has troops.

225
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,039
And you still dare

226
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
to talk big and spout nonsense?

227
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,439
Did you see that signal flare just now?

228
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,961
What signal do you think it was?

229
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,961
It's just the Peace Preservation Corps.

230
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,160
The Commanding Officer

231
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,159
wiped them out long ago.

232
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,321
Impossible.

233
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,520
That's absolutely impossible.

234
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,561
Commander Li had such a perfect ambush.

235
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,000
You...

236
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:06,480
You...

237
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:08,040
You're lying!

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,159
You call that a perfect ambush?

239
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,480
We cleared them out ages ago.

240
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:13,241
The map was already delivered.

241
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,519
Yang Ziqi!

242
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,321
I'll kill you!

243
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,280
Watch out, Xiaojiu!
