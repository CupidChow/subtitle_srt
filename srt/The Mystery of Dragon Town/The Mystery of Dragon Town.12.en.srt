13
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,819
Thank you all

14
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,900
- for attending my wedding with Yu Shuang.
- for attending my wedding with Meng Lin.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,379
Yu Shuang.

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,060
We've got you some drinks

17
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,549
for this joyful occasion.

18
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,500
Yu Shuang. Yu Shuang!

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,869
Where's Yu Shuang?

20
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,010
Where is she?

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,810
Yang Ziqi.

22
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,580
Wake up.

23
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,989
Yang Ziqi.

24
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,829
Yang Ziqi.

25
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,970
Yang Ziqi.

26
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,869
It's them!

27
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,460
Get them!

28
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,130
By my swift order.

29
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,340
What's wrong with you?
Gosh, watch your way!

30
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,714
Can't you slow down?

31
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,389
What's with this couple?

32
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,119
What's going on?

33
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,587
Why are they running?

34
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:31,427
What's with them?

35
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,050
Are you okay?

36
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,700
What happened to me?

37
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,730
You got in the car and said
there was something off with the theater.

38
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,819
You then passed out.

39
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,139
It took you a while to come about.

40
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,090
The theater.

41
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,640
There was something wrong
with that pill.

42
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,170
Well,

43
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,260
it was most likely made of opium.

44
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,229
They use both pills and mantras

45
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,410
to hypnotize those people,

46
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,490
giving them the illusion
that they're in netherworld.

47
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,530
Luckily, you woke me up.

48
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,619
Otherwise, I don't know

49
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,820
what would happen.

50
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,650
Don't mention it.

51
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,429
I've returned

52
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,730
the favor, then.

53
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,259
Are you all right?

54
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,340
Do you still feel dizzy?

55
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,780
I've seen a doctor and had the medicine.

56
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,020
Do we still need to go to hospital?

57
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,460
I'm fine.

58
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,560
It's just that
I'm still feeling a bit disoriented.

59
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,739
Detective Yang.

60
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,819
When a girl says no,

61
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,730
that means it's a yes.

62
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,719
You don't know what's in my mind.

63
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,480
Are you sure
you don't need to go to hospital?

64
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,109
Yang Ziqi.

65
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,610
Have we just met?

66
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,260
No.

67
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,730
Well, what do I mean when I say no?

68
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,460
It's a no.

69
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,469
It's certainly easier

70
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,139
to talk to a smart man

71
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,429
than to an idiot.

72
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,029
You're right.

73
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,379
Detective Yang's smarter than me.

74
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,299
If so, Detective Yang,

75
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,700
what's our next move?

76
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,650
I gave the station a call.

77
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,050
But they couldn't find out

78
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,850
anything
about the theater owner, Sui Wen.

79
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,780
It's as if he were a phantom.

80
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,819
Detective Yang.

81
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,789
I didn't expect you

82
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,850
to believe in supernatural stuff now.

83
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,020
I didn't mean it that way.

84
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,610
Come, let's go grab something to eat.

85
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,340
Xiaojiu, what you need now
are a lot of nutrients.

86
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,739
Indeed!

87
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,059
I want to have a big bowl of meat,

88
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,909
a big bowl of noodles,

89
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,220
and a big bowl of liquor.

90
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,259
Let's go.

91
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,970
Sure!

92
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,650
Life is all about devouring meat.

93
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,020
It goes with garlic.

94
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,739
And drink your liquor in large gulps.

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,650
Here!

96
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,020
Why aren't you eating?

97
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,610
One more jar of liquor, waiter!

98
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,410
Stop drinking.

99
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,580
Well...

100
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,139
You can hold your liquor?

101
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,490
I'd say

102
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,139
no one in this town

103
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,730
can hold their liquor better than me.

104
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,260
I learned how to drink from my master
when I was young.

105
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,050
Well, how did you meet Master Jiu?

106
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,410
When I was young,

107
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,020
my master took me in.

108
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,700
Okay.

109
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,050
Let's drop the subject.

110
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,380
Get me another jar of liquor, then.

111
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,170
Hurry up.

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,970
Here, cheers.

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,780
Finish it all.

114
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,499
He's the one!

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,580
He opened the door for me
at the Yu Residence.

116
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,739
Stop running! Stop right there!

117
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,499
It's dangerous!

118
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,340
Well...

119
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,820
We know nothing
about what's going on out there.

120
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,460
Just wait for me here.

121
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,490
It must be the doing
of those from the theater.

122
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,340
I'll apply for a search warrant

123
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,770
and catch them all tomorrow.

124
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,589
Xiaojiu.

125
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,730
Your arm is bleeding.

126
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,309
Well, I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

127
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,460
I'll take you to hospital.

128
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,300
- There's really no need for that.
- It no longer hurts.

129
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,309
I think you should stay in the station.
It's safer there.

130
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,779
It's okay.

131
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,010
I'll just head back to Dragon Mountain.
It's the safest place to be.

132
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,490
Let me take you there.

133
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,899
Do you want to know what that powder

134
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,419
is made of?

135
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,229
Please

136
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,940
spare me the details.

137
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,970
Be grateful.

138
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,890
Xiaojiu.

139
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,940
Are you all right, girl?

140
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,949
Old man,

141
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,580
you're the best!

142
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,539
This is mine.

143
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,730
Just forget about it.

144
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,660
You stingy man.

145
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,220
Girl,

146
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,019
is your arm

147
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,189
really okay?

148
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,180
It's all fine.

149
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,730
Fortunately, Yang Ziqi was there.

150
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,709
If it weren't for him,

151
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,700
I would've had a more serious injury.

152
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,850
Since your return,

153
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,619
you've mentioned his name

154
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,730
for 36 times.

155
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,770
Well...

156
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,660
Well...

157
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,090
We're investigating the case together.

158
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,739
Without mentioning him,

159
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,419
how do I tell you about the progress?

160
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,419
Indeed.

161
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,920
They're looking into the case.

162
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,890
So, do you find him trustworthy now?

163
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,890
If so, just follow your heart.

164
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,890
You can't drink due to the injury.

165
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,580
That makes this liquor mine.

166
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,700
Xiaojiu.

167
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,090
When did you get these stuff?

168
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,340
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,300
I didn't buy anything.

170
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,700
Who did it?

171
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,180
I don't see anything here.

172
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,127
(Sui Wen)

173
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,920
(Linjiangxian Theater)

174
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,600
(Linjiangxian Theater)

175
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,340
Yes.

176
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm Yang Ziqi.

177
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,370
Is that so?

178
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,660
Great!

179
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,060
A week will do.

180
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,659
Immortal Master.

181
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,770
Master Jiu of the Dragon Palace.

182
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,580
What a lousy engraved work.

183
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,229
It's a fake title to begin with.

184
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,840
What's the use of making it look fancy?

185
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,340
Just finish your food.

186
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,180
What are you doing there?

187
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,130
Don't I look good?

188
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,709
They look good with that makeup on.

189
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,370
It doesn't work on you though.

190
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,850
You've gone overboard!

191
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,220
Don't I look good?

192
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,730
Don't I look beautiful with this on?

193
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,619
You look unique

194
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,940
and extraordinary.

195
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,770
I'm not eating. I'm off.

196
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,770
Eat first.

197
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,989
I'm out investigating the case.

198
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,730
And I'm not hungry.

199
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,540
How unique

200
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,890
and extraordinary.

201
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,259
What's with that look?

202
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,970
It's dangerous!

203
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,460
It's dangerous.

204
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,180
Don't I look good?

205
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,180
You look nice.

206
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,490
Forget it.

207
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,580
Stop rubbing it.

208
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,700
Wipe off that scary makeup with this.

209
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,580
Scary makeup, huh?

210
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,420
How dare you?

211
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,360
You're not using that perfume
that smells like a horse's urine today?

212
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,259
Tell me.

213
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,370
What's good news?

214
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,660
The Central Police Department

215
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,309
has transferred the director
to the province.

216
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,770
He'll be away for one week.

217
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,090
So you can access the police station
as you please throughout.

218
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,420
No one will stop us
from investigating the case.

219
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,970
You're smart after all.

220
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,640
(Dragon Town Police Station)

221
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,779
Detective... Detective Yang!

222
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,619
Yu Shuang's body...

223
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,229
It's...

224
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,539
It's found!

225
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,460
Where is it?

226
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,920
♪Misty moonlight in Xiangxi's night♪

227
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,120
♪Fog veils the entire Dragon Town♪

228
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,880
♪Corpse herders drift like fleeting shade♪

229
