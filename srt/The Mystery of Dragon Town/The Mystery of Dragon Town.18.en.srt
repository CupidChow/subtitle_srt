12

=Episode 18=

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,770
You murdered Jingtian.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,779
I'll be honest with you.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,258
I truly wanted to kill that man

16
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,770
on my friend's behalf.

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,289
But what a shame.

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,618
It wasn't me.

19
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,658
Miss Youruo,

20
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:55,850
it was Zhao Lin.

21
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:57,298
Miss Youruo!

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,289
It was Zhao Lin.

23
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,009
He murdered Mr. Jingtian.

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,329
Zhao Lin?

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,018
I told you before.

26
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,770
We mustn't keep Zhao Lin here.

27
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,809
Yesterday,

28
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,259
after we sent the witch doctor away,

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,779
I saw him sneaking into

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,369
Mr. Jingtian's room.

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,979
When I was inside, I saw him

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,539
cutting off Mr. Jingtian's head

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,490
while he was unconscious.

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,569
He slashed me as well.

35
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,369
I pursued him until
we exited the valley.

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,979
However, he set up an ambush
and knocked me unconscious.

37
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,040
I came here to report it to you immediately
after regaining consciousness.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,658
Look.

39
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,050
The cut wound on Mr. Jingtian's neck

40
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:33,809
was caused by this very Miao dagger.

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,850
What grudges do he have

42
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,050
against Mr. Jingtian?

43
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:41,649
Why did he choose to strike last night?

44
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,139
Zhao Lin fell for

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,089
Miss Youruo for many years.

46
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,539
However,

47
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,139
Miss Youruo had her hands tied
taking care of Mr. Jingtian.

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,490
She had no time for relationships.

49
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,330
Before you guys arrived,

50
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,809
Mr. Jingtian's health
was deteriorating day after day.

51
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,938
He couldn't live for long.

52
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,009
However,

53
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,018
yesterday,

54
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,818
after seeing Ma Gu's disciple
and receiving the witch doctor's treatment,

55
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,920
he felt unusually energetic
in the middle of the night.

56
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,009
I assume that Zhao Lin was afraid

57
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:11,099
that his years of companionship
might all go to waste.

58
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,610
What's with all the explanation?

59
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,170
I'll definitely capture Zhao Lin myself.

60
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,859
I'll make him confess his crime

61
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,249
in front of Jingtian's tomb.

62
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,099
After that, I'll end his life

63
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,689
in the cruelest way.

64
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,490
I'll show everyone the consequences
of being a betrayer

65
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,929
in order to appease Jingtian's spirit.

66
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,129
To be honest,

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,699
the opium

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,290
that you guys are looking for

69
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,610
was planted by Zhao Lin as well.

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,010
So, Zhao Lin, an innkeeper,

71
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,890
is able to secretly

72
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:50,419
cultivate poppies

73
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,969
and sell opium without your knowledge?

74
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,979
Due to Miss Youruo,

75
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,699
everyone here always thought of Zhao Lin

76
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,689
as the third person-in-charge
of the family.

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,699
Therefore, when he cultivated poppies
outside the valley,

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,249
we just turned a blind eye to it.

79
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,490
Don't worry.

80
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:26,050
All of the goods have been distributed.

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,129
Tell Black Snake

82
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,529
that

83
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,898
I make the call

84
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,929
in Medicine King Valley now.

85
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,210
That was an excellent feint.

86
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,450
You guys!

87
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,778
In ten seconds,

88
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,730
your arm will cease to function.

89
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,570
Are you sure you want to go inside?

90
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,089
Stop crawling into your hole.

91
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,770
Even if you do,

92
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,939
you're just a turtle

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,419
hiding behind its shell.

94
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,960
You may be able to escape for now,
but you cannot escape forever.

95
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,099
If you die inside,

96
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,979
no one will collect your body.

97
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,899
However,

98
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,370
if you survive,

99
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,938
I'll chop you into pieces

100
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,370
and feed you to the dogs.

101
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,339
Zhao Lin wasn't the one

102
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,890
who murdered Mr. Jingtian.

103
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,049
It was you.

104
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,378
I don't know what
you guys are talking about.

105
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,659
You're ruthless.

106
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,409
You almost killed Miss Youruo
as well during the ritual.

107
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,810
I don't understand you.

108
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,890
Show him.

109
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,459
I'm sure

110
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,529
there are plenty
of the same birds in your room.

111
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,210
Do you need us to catch them for you?

112
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,529
The Medicine King Valley
is littered with these critters.

113
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,099
Don't spout nonsense.

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,049
If so,

115
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,378
what makes you think

116
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,339
Cheng Lao'er

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,010
would definitely die
after lying on the nail bed?

118
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:04,539
And, why was Shi Youruo attacked

119
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,930
by these strange birds
on the ritual table for no reason?

120
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,659
Don't tell me

121
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,089
they're mere coincidences.

122
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,298
Cheng Lao'er

123
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,938
deserved to die.

124
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,409
He offended the Nuo deity.

125
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:15,969
I don't think you told Cheng Lao'er that

126
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:17,450
in the first place.

127
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,210
He was the one

128
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,419
who blackmailed me with my family's life

129
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,280
and made me frame you guys.

130
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,618
I helped him dispose of two corpses.

131
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,539
He even promised me

132
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,099
that he would tamper with the nail bed

133
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,609
so that I would survive.

134
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,339
I followed his instructions.

135
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,138
However, he applied poison to the nails.

136
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,539
He wanted to silence me.

137
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,818
Luckily, one of our friends
is a poison expert.

138
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:38,579
If not,

139
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,370
you would've gotten your way.

140
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,498
Yeah. I did that.

141
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:42,930
So what?

142
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,979
You four are intelligent people.

143
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,160
Businessmen like us
only care about trades and profits.

144
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,609
Why so serious?

145
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:49,969
Don't you agree?

146
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,089
Now, I'm the top herb specialist

147
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,579
of Medicine King Valley.

148
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,010
Let's join hands.

149
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,409
In the future,

150
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:57,810
we can make money together.

151
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,089
Isn't that great?

152
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,289
Yeah.

153
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:01,539
Join hands, huh?

154
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,979
That's why you had
a fierce argument with Zhao Lin.

155
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,178
It's all because

156
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,019
Zhao Lin found out

157
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,258
that your birds attacked Shi Youruo.

158
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,859
You used that to your advantage.

159
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,899
You murdered Mr. Jingtian.

160
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,419
You got yourself a scapegoat.

161
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,258
You even

162
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,649
tricked Shi Youruo into leaving
Medicine King Valley.

163
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,019
Yes.

164
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,729
But why are you meddling with this?

165
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,938
Let's just join hands.

166
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,849
We'll be able to get everything we want.

167
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,979
Keep a close eye on him.

168
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,330
I'll check the secret chamber.

169
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,169
Keep a close eye on him.

170
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,760
I'll check out the secret chamber too.

171
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,498
I know you're angry at him.

172
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:38,920
You can vent your frustrations on him.

173
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,810
Just don't kill him.

174
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,618
Did you discover anything?

175
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,049
I discovered traces of opium.

176
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:06,810
Indeed.

177
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:09,330
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

178
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,899
I don't necessarily
need to use my eyes to do that.

179
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,570
I can monitor him with my ears. Listen.

180
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,489
This slap is for you blackmailing me.

181
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:17,539
This slap

182
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,099
is for you tricking me.

183
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,579
I suppose such cruel methods

184
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,890
fit your style.

185
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,579
(Yutang House, Eight)
Is this his ledger?

186
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,258
That's right.

187
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,339
All of the names above

188
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,489
are people
who have traded drugs with him.

189
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,690
There are that many of them?

190
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,319
I knew it.

191
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,950
(Baishan Chamber of Commerce)

192
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,480
It's the Baishan Chamber of Commerce.

193
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:44,779
Luoluo!

194
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,049
Luoluo, are you there?

195
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,409
Come here for a second.

196
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:49,938
Look.

197
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,178
There are plenty of herbs here.

198
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,690
Is there any Soul Grass here?

199
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,849
None of them are Soul Grass.

200
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,058
If only the Yin Sting Bug
were still alive.

201
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,930
It could've helped us in locating them.

202
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,539
All these people exhibit the same symptoms
as the birds in your room.

203
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,419
Bloodshot eyes and numbness to pain.

204
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,729
Those are symptoms
after ingesting Soul Grass.

205
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,019
I have no idea what these people

206
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,169
and the birds have experienced.

207
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,969
It has nothing to do with me.

208
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,529
The so-called "Soul Grass"

209
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,178
you guys had mentioned,

210
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,049
I haven't even heard of it before.

211
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,409
Talk!

212
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,049
Where's the Soul Grass?

213
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,818
Is it with Mr. Jingtian or Miss Youruo?

214
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,539
I truly have no idea.

215
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,240
I only know that Mr. Jingtian

216
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,600
has been devoting himself
to develop medicinal herbs all along.

217
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,170
As for the herbs he was developing,

218
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,650
I truly have no idea.

219
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,018
Once the herbs are ready,

220
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,800
the chamber of commerce
will retrieve them.

221
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,849
Baishan Chamber of Commerce?

222
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,170
The two outsiders,

223
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,179
did Baishan Chamber of Commerce

224
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,570
order you to kill them?

225
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,898
They were sneaking around.

226
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,520
We could tell
that they were up to no good.

227
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,170
They were killed by our mountain patrol.

228
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,889
If so, why did you guys frame us?

229
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,219
I was beaten up for nothing.

230
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,489
Zhao Lin said

231
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,299
you guys weren't herb traders.

232
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,849
I merely wanted to bluff you guys.

233
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,249
You're a good liar, aren't you?

234
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,538
Zhao Lin is already dead.

235
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:11,849
There's no one to testify against you.
Who can we ask?

236
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:16,210
How long has Baishan Chamber of Commerce
been working together with you all?

237
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,129
Is their contact

238
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,609
Sui Wen?

239
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,330
I think so.

240
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,450
They act mysteriously.

241
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:25,979
Whenever we make contact,

242
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,018
the contact person

243
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,859
is always the freak
with the pale complexion.

244
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,738
After that,

245
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,170
they would smuggle the goods

246
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,489
through transporting corpses.

247
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,009
The corpse herders?

248
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,450
That's impossible.

249
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,330
When did they transport

250
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,849
the last batch of goods?

251
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:43,930
Last night.

252
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,378
So, in the end,

253
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,579
last night's incident
was just a feint, huh?

254
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,699
Let's go after them now.

255
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,360
It's likely that we can catch up to them
before they reach Dragon Town.

256
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:53,489
Where's my gun?

257
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,769
Where did you keep it?

258
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,769
Guys,

259
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,538
please release me.

260
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,939
You guys should think carefully.

261
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,410
The current situation

262
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,939
isn't doing you guys any good.

263
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,609
Stay here.

264
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,930
The cops will come here tomorrow.

265
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,009
Let's go.

266
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,290
You!

267
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,160
I forgot to praise you.

268
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,200
You could tell that
something was off about Mr. Zhong.

269
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,690
You flatter me.

270
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,160
You could tell that something
was off about his arm as well.

271
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,538
He said he pursued Zhao Lin

272
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,440
and was knocked unconscious
outside the valley.

273
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,538
According to that logic,

274
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,489
his wounds would have
scarred over long ago.

275
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,179
The wound wouldn't rupture

276
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,729
if there were no rigorous activities.

277
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,769
Unless he rips the scabs off himself

278
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,089
and make it bleed on purpose.

279
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,360
Are there corpse herders
in Baishan Chamber of Commerce as well?

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,579
My master is the only corpse herder
in the entire Dragon Town.

281
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,018
But he quit long ago.

282
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,210
What happened last time was an accident.

283
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,210
Let's split up.

284
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,609
Xiaojiu and I will pursue
the corpse herders.

285
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,840
You and Luoluo can take
the shortcut, return to Dragon Town,

286
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,880
and report this case to Master Jiu
and Deputy Mayor.

287
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,418
Don't worry.

288
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,810
I'll ensure

289
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,889
Miss Luoluo's safety.

290
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,290
Go away.

291
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,330
Wait for me.

292
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,889
Let's go.

293
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,138
The God of Happiness is passing through.

294
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,009
Keep away from the living.

295
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,650
The God of Happiness is passing through.
Keep away from the living.

296
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,258
The God of Happiness is passing through.

297
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,249
Keep away from the living.

298
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,138
The God of Happiness is passing through.

299
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,570
Keep away from the living.

300
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:36,210
The God of Happiness is passing through.
Keep away from the living.
