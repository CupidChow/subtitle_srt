=Episode 5=

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,530
Are you sure

14
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,969
the Old Wu you saw

15
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,490
was human?

16
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,769
I've been here before.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,819
Why is it

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,090
like this now?

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,489
It's haunted.

20
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,329
They were all killed by ghosts.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,290
All killed by ghosts.

22
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:29,409
How did Old Wu die?

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,730
A ghost killed him too.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,579
This mass grave

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,409
is where all the villagers
who died violently are buried.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,230
(Wu Qingzhi's grave)

27
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,370
This is his grave.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,530
Wu Qingzhi.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,010
That name actually sounds educated.

30
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:55,810
I thought you only read books
on demons and sorcery.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,819
Yeah.

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,939
Want me to slap
a talisman on your forehead

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,739
to drain the water from your brain?

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,209
Keep it for yourself.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,329
Don't run!

36
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,739
- Chase him first.
- Check the grave first.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,650
You...

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,490
Fine.

39
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,050
Let's check your grave first.

40
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,459
That fall nearly killed me.

41
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,590
(Wu Qingzhi)

42
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,650
The grave is empty.

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,179
No one under you?

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,569
Someone's on top of me.

45
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,530
Get up first.

46
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:37,810
Fine.

47
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,090
Either

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,330
you untie this rubbish for me first

49
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,699
or my next step

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,538
lands somewhere

51
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,849
I can't guarantee.

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,289
I'll untie it.

53
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,849
But if you dare run,

54
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,090
you'll spend your retirement
at the police station.

55
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,169
Threatening me?

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,459
Where these feet go next

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,250
is out of my hands.

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,969
Fine.

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,058
It's getting dark.

60
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,250
Let's sleep.

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,818
The key's in

62
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,169
my left pocket.

63
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,610
You could've just said that earlier.

64
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,250
Master Eight.

65
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,810
Master Eight.

66
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,299
Days ago, I was overwhelmed
with sorrow and rage.

67
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,459
My enemy committed countless evil deeds.

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,370
I had no power to seek justice
for my deceased daughter.

69
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,449
(Spirit tablet of Wu Nianci)
So I prayed to you with all my heart.

70
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,739
May that villain
be punished by the heavens

71
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,689
to set things right.

72
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,090
Thanks to your divine guidance,

73
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,529
my vengeance was fulfilled.

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,209
I am eternally grateful.

75
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,649
Nianci...

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,418
(Wu Nianci)

77
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,290
That's the soul of the wicked man.

78
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:50,370
He's turned into a pool of black blood.

79
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,050
I offer it as a sacrifice to you.

80
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:57,050
If your spirit knows this,

81
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,930
you can rest in peace now.

82
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,129
Actually...

83
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,170
You are Wu Qingzhi, aren't you?

84
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,290
You're mistaken.

85
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,329
I'm just the village guardian.

86
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,889
You pretend to limp,

87
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,738
but the soles of your shoes

88
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,529
are worn down evenly.

89
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,449
Your palms

90
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,970
soft and smooth,

91
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,139
look more like

92
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,370
a potter's hands,
used to working with clay.

93
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,738
You won't even admit

94
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,298
your real name?

95
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:36,379
Wu Qingzhi.

96
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,769
You lie right in front

97
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,290
of General Fan Wujiu.

98
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,730
Are you even worthy
of being his follower?

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,009
Tell us.

100
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,329
What's going on

101
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,889
between you and He Shanshan?

102
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,089
He Shanshan deserved to die.

103
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,050
Everyone who bullied Nianci
deserved to die.

104
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,139
Nianci and I depended on each other.

105
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,899
This piece of pottery was...

106
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,730
She'd go to town on market days
to sell her ceramics.

107
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,290
All it took was
a few casual words with Yu Shuang.

108
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,810
He Shanshan saw them.

109
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:23,569
That woman
accused Nianci of seducing her man.

110
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,379
Wu Nianci,

111
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,418
you little slut.

112
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,610
Let's see how you plan to use
that face to seduce anyone now.

113
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,529
Still smiling like that?

114
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,649
I want to see

115
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,858
if you can still smile now.

116
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:44,259
Extra, extra!

117
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,819
Outrage against heaven!

118
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,738
Wicked woman seduces elderly man.

119
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,858
Disgraceful and incestuous.

120
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,649
Utterly disgusting.

121
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,209
To get back at Nianci,

122
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,689
she deliberately made up lies about us.

123
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:59,129
An incestuous affair.

124
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,858
Nianci couldn't take the humiliation.

125
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,290
She tried to take her own life.

126
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,529
Thankfully, I saved her in time.

127
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,449
Silly girl...

128
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,170
You foolish child...

129
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,170
I planned to take Nianci away from here

130
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,370
and start a new life.

131
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,418
But then...

132
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,499
Let's leave this place.

133
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,059
All right.

134
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,298
Let's start over.

135
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,250
All right.

136
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,499
Where are you going?

137
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,738
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

138
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,699
But then...

139
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,810
The villagers blocked every way out.

140
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:54,850
Dad!

141
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:55,930
Dad!

142
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,978
Beat him to death!

143
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,370
Get lost!

144
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,089
Dad!

145
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,889
Go!

146
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:06,089
Let go of me!

147
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,610
Let go of me!

148
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,970
Dad!

149
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:16,209
Dad!

150
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,139
You monsters... All of you!

151
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,649
Monsters!

152
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,170
I'm such a useless father!

153
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,730
Monsters!

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,850
Monsters!

155
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,970
You monsters!

156
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,009
My daughter...

157
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,570
The world is so unjust...

158
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,009
So unjust!

159
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,129
So...

160
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,090
This village isn't haunted.

161
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:12,058
You faked it all.

162
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,739
You scared these people to death.

163
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,009
He Shanshan deserved to die.

164
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,499
So did everyone who bullied Nianci.

165
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,698
Then...

166
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:22,058
He Shanshan's death

167
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,809
was your doing too.

168
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,970
I waited for a year.

169
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,850
Finally, I got the chance
to get close to her.

170
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,289
That day,

171
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,418
her driver

172
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,169
just happened to leave early.

173
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,889
Wasn't that fate helping me?

174
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:39,219
Not only did I kill her,

175
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,730
I used forbidden rites.

176
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,739
I made sure she couldn't even be buried.

177
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,619
That bitch will never rise again!

178
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,529
No.

179
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,619
You're lying.

180
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,298
You killed her

181
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,809
out of revenge.

182
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,169
You had no reason
to rummage through her drawer.

183
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:00,330
Who doesn't want money?

184
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,298
She owed that to Nianci.

185
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:04,458
But He Shanshan

186
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,219
still had her gold watch on.

187
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,778
If you were after money,

188
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,009
that doesn't add up.

189
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,289
In fact,

190
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,929
when you got there,

191
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,538
He Shanshan was already dead.

192
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,769
Wasn't she?

193
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,009
No.

194
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,730
I'm the one who killed her.

195
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,370
I prayed to Master Eight to kill her.

196
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,298
If the ghost envoys wanted her dead,

197
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,490
she wouldn't live past midnight.

198
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,450
People like us, from the bottom rung,
we have no one to speak for us.

199
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,938
All we can do is pray to spirits

200
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:36,210
to give us justice.

201
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,009
Inside the coffin...

202
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,049
Don't touch her!

203
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,658
Those evil people...

204
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,450
Didn't they deserve to die?

205
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,219
I sought justice for my daughter.

206
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,889
What did I do wrong?

207
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:04,929
Personally,

208
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,289
I sympathize with your pain.

209
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,809
But as an officer of the law,

210
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:10,889
every case,

211
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,818
good or evil,

212
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,649
must be judged by the law.

213
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,970
In this chaotic world,

214
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,259
you still talk about

215
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,058
justice through law?

216
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,330
Where is this law then?

217
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:40,850
Uncle Wu.

218
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,529
I really do understand
what you've been through.

219
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,619
But,

220
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,259
we really need to know.

221
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,698
When you got there,

222
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,649
what exactly was He Shanshan's state?

223
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,210
Thank you, Master Eight,
for your protection.

224
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,450
Help me.

225
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,690
Please help me.

226
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,178
Save me.

227
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:36,690
I'm begging you.

228
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,289
These eyes,

229
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,178
they can't tell right from wrong.

230
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,490
- They deserve to go blind.
- Don't kill me.

231
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,538
Please don't kill me.

232
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,129
I... I'll tell you a secret.

233
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,979
This secret

234
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,970
can make you rich
for the rest of your life.

235
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,379
Just don't kill me.

236
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,570
Speak.

237
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,859
I won't help you.

238
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,139
Take your secret

239
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,970
with you to hell.

240
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,339
That tongue

241
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,219
used to twisting truth

242
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,690
deserves to be cut out.

243
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:34,330
Nianci...

244
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,730
Father has avenged you.

245
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,178
The one who ruined your life

246
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:41,850
will be trapped here forever.

247
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,850
Never to be reborn.

248
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,929
Before she died,

249
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,769
what did she say?

250
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,490
I will never tell you.

251
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,090
I want that bitch He Shanshan

252
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,450
to die with regret.

253
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,250
Watch out!

254
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,049
Master Eight.

255
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,619
I once made a vow.

256
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,379
If you helped me take my revenge,

257
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,169
I would offer you the blood of my heart

258
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,330
as tribute.

259
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,570
I, Wu Qingzhi,

260
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,690
never break a promise.

261
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,009
Nianci.

262
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:40,490
Father's mission is complete.

263
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,649
I'm coming to join you now.

264
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,289
It wasn't him.

265
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,529
Then who killed He Shanshan?

266
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:04,570
Could it be

267
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,330
was it really Black Wuchang?

268
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,110
(Commanding Talisman)

269
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,250
Master.

270
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,809
His bone marrow is soaked in blood.

271
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,178
All his bones were already broken

272
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,570
before he died.

273
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,778
He was still alive

274
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,090
when he snapped his own joints.

275
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,129
That was the only way
he could fit inside the barrel.

276
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,619
Master,

277
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,938
do you think he was hiding

278
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:53,250
from something unclean?

279
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,818
I'm not being superstitious.

280
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,778
It's just that the people
who died recently,

281
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,610
they all died in such strange ways.

282
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,690
You can't explain it with science.

283
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,850
And look at his eyes.

284
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,259
What did he see before he died

285
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,649
to make them open so wide?

286
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,129
Master.

287
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,698
Outside the morgue,

288
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,129
there are four more bodies.

289
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,418
And right at this moment,

290
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,330
though...

291
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,649
Enough.

292
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,019
You're scaring yourself.

293
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,520
How are you supposed to work like this?

294
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,058
Go to the morgue.

295
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,099
Bring He Shanshan's body over here.

296
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,769
I'm going to perform an autopsy.

297
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,210
But Master...

298
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:36,739
I...

299
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,090
I'm getting creeped out.

300
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,658
I'll go instead.

301
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:40,899
You check the wiring.

302
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,649
See what's going on with the power.

303
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,409
All right.

00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,760
