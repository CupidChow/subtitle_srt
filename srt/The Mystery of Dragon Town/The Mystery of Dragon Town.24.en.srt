13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,850
Yang Ziqi,

14
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:44,551
I'm going to kill you!

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,270
Watch out, Xiaojiu!

16
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:57,990
Everyone, don't move!

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,710
Wu Liyi.

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,850
Arrest Yang Ziqi now.

19
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:02,609
And let me go!

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,990
Shut up!

21
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,369
Liu.

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,590
Arrest all of them

23
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,089
and keep an eye

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,530
on all these smuggled goods.

25
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,490
We've done a great contribution here!

26
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:13,390
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,169
Get them all!

28
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,530
Put them all in jail!

29
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,369
And question

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,569
each one of them!

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,250
Brothers,

32
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:20,431
do it!

33
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:20,970
Yes, sir!

34
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,449
Yes, sir!

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,490
Get them!

36
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,231
Stay still!

37
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,791
Move!

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,410
Get up!

39
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,950
Detective Yang.
I'll get them out of here.

40
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,791
I asked you to just deliver the nap, no?

41
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,071
What are you doing here?

42
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:40,711
That's none of your business.

43
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,050
Detective Yang.

44
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,929
So, have I done a good job
dealing with such a critical moment?

45
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,770
Well,

46
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:49,209
could you please

47
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,649
put in a good word for me

48
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,631
in front of the Commanding Officer?

49
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,190
Detective Yang. It's time to head back
to the station and settle the case.

50
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,929
No wonder

51
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,449
he wanted more than

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,690
deceiving the Commanding Officer.

53
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,071
He even tried to kill him.

54
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,470
It turned out that he was
the Commanding Officer's deserter.

55
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,210
(Male, Han Chinese)
Who do you think

56
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,670
I got this identity card from?

57
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,390
The division commander?

58
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,810
Well... Where is he?

59
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,090
The Commanding Officer

60
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:18,729
is now in the Medicine King Valley.

61
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,191
There are plenty of drug
to be destroyed.

62
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,210
Why?

63
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,511
Are you going to wait for him?

64
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,191
Where is

65
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,071
the real Li Da?

66
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,231
Answer me!

67
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:35,950
I

68
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,110
got rid of him long ago.

69
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,830
I joined the Xiangxi
National Protection Army in 1916.

70
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,990
Later on,

71
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,071
the division commander lost the battle
fighting the rebels.

72
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,049
The commander

73
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,631
was then disarmed.

74
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,530
So I took a few of our men

75
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,049
and fled the army.

76
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,591
We ended up becoming bandits.

77
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,609
We'll get rid of that coachman first.

78
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,710
One day,

79
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,791
I robbed a horse carriage.

80
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:09,950
Please spare our lives!

81
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,390
Kill them all.

82
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,489
Boss,

83
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,169
it's a done deal.

84
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,410
And I found out

85
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:22,540
that the one in the carriage

86
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,103
(We hereby appoint Li Da)
was the political commissioner

87
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,160
(as a political commissioner.)
sent from Beiping, Li Da.

88
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,530
I noticed we resembled one another.

89
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,289
Boss,

90
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,870
you're becoming an officer.

91
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,950
So I had an idea.

92
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,471
I'm sorry, brothers.

93
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,270
I'm going to do this alone.

94
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,169
From now on,

95
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,370
I, Liu Guang,

96
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,311
am going to become successful.

97
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,810
I took his place

98
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,049
and came to Dragon Town.

99
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,410
At first, I was worried
I'd give the game away.

100
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,569
Then

101
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,150
I found out that the Beiyang government
was in total chaos.

102
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:04,009
So no one took care of this matter.

103
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,930
After that...

104
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,830
After that, I put down my guard.

105
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,631
I involved in the opium business

106
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,449
to make some money.

107
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,210
But

108
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,169
that Tian Zhen had been suppressing it.

109
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,370
Fortunately,

110
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,550
Shi Jingtian discovered
the Soul Grass then.

111
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,951
I was thinking.

112
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,129
If I became the mayor,

113
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,210
I could

114
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,689
make a lot of money

115
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,890
and recruit many men

116
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,289
with the Soul Grass.

117
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,289
That way, my safety would be ensured.

118
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,591
Little did I know

119
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,489
Yu Shuang would

120
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,310
steal that appointment letter.

121
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,990
He even tried
to threatened me with that.

122
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,231
Commissioner Li.

123
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,990
We just want money.

124
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,770
If you give me enough money,

125
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:41,609
rest assured,

126
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,391
I will surely keep this a secret.

127
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,271
Great.

128
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,770
I knew

129
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:51,750
you'd never say no to money.

130
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,070
Here, Yu.

131
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,530
I'll toast with tea instead.

132
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,970
May our collaboration

133
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,271
be more exciting

134
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,510
as time goes by.

135
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,031
Get rid of him.

136
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,430
And find the appointment letter.

137
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,031
Remember.

138
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,911
Be discreet.

139
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,010
He Shanshan

140
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,831
did swallow that appointment letter.

141
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,010
I didn't want to get myself
into trouble,

142
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:32,369
so I had Sui Wen

143
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,049
to pretend to be a vengeful female ghost

144
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,430
to put an end of it all.

145
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,351
Little did I expect

146
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,410
that this young funeral worker here

147
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:41,791
would insist

148
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,010
on looking into it.

149
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,151
In the end...

150
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,351
In the end, you figured everything out.

151
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,911
So,

152
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,231
where is Yu Shuang's body?

153
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,249
Wasn't it sent to the ghost mansion?

154
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,310
It was buried under that tree.

155
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,791
It's that simple?

156
00:05:58,571 --> 00:05:59,990
Yes.

157
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:03,330
Detective Yang.

158
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:04,090
I...

159
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,410
I've told you everything I should.

160
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,151
Please let me go.

161
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,591
Well,

162
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,670
the Commanding Officer
will make the call.

163
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,249
Detective Yang!

164
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,090
Detective Yang!

165
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,951
Please let me go!

166
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,151
- Shuang!
- Oh, Shuang!

167
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,990
- Shuang!
- Shuang!

168
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,110
Oh, Shuang!

169
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:30,530
Shuang!

170
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:33,770
I always told you to obey the rules

171
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,430
and never go astray.

172
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,689
Li Da has always been an evil man.

173
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,430
How could you collude with him?

174
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,430
You should've known better!

175
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,471
Miss Jiu.

176
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:56,330
I apologize for what I did

177
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,090
to you.

178
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,911
My anger got the best of me and I
ended up wronging a kind soul like you.

179
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,729
If it hadn't been for you,

180
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,471
I'm afraid

181
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:08,129
my Shuang would never
get to rest in peace.

182
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,310
Miss Jiu.

183
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,210
We wronged you

184
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,351
and said all those hurtful words.

185
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,410
Yet, you let it slide

186
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,249
and helped us find Shuang.

187
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,911
You cleared his name.

188
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,809
Well,

189
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,530
we will kneel and kowtow to you!

190
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,770
Please don't!

191
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:25,729
We will kowtow to you.

192
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,570
Get up.

193
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,870
There's no need for that.

194
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,750
I did what I did

195
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,430
to bring justice to myself.

196
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:33,711
Miss Jiu.

197
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,330
Could you be kind enough

198
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,650
and help us

199
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,430
with our Shuang's funeral?

200
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:43,970
Miss Jiu.

201
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,151
Please.

202
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,351
Please help us

203
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,550
with Shuang's funeral.

204
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,951
Please!

205
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,271
- Lass.
- Please.

206
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,271
Life is short.

207
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,650
There's no need to delve

208
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:00,310
into the unhappy past.

209
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,450
As funeral workers,

210
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:04,630
we deal with afterlife.

211
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,729
Never mind

212
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,249
what he was like when he was living.

213
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,369
Now that he's gone,

214
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,770
we will make sure

215
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,591
he leaves this world in a proper manner.

216
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,831
And that's our job.

217
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,031
Jiu.

218
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,750
From now on,

219
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,831
you're on our own.

220
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,010
You will be in charge of this funeral.

221
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,430
And I'll help you out.

222
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,951
Everyone.

223
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,390
I have no idea

224
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,951
when we will
see each other again after this.

225
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,071
So

226
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,351
you must take care.

227
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,711
Yang.

228
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,750
Is this the only way?

229
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,150
The whole world is at war.

230
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,369
I think

231
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,729
it's quite nice for us
to live together in Dragon Town.

232
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,810
Well,

233
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,110
why don't you stay?

234
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,240
The Commanding Officer was ordered
to join the Northern Expedition.

235
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,609
That's a military order

236
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,951
which must be obeyed.

237
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:13,711
Xiaojiu.

238
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,150
Why are you looking at me that way?

239
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,471
I'm not reluctant to bid you farewell.

240
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,330
When I first met you,

241
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:28,910
I found you annoying.

242
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:30,311
After that,

243
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:31,711
as time went by,

244
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:33,870
I've got used to it.

245
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,090
I'll be greater after this.

246
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:37,630
So don't you come back here.

247
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,609
Otherwise,

248
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,431
you will get jealous
with my good life here.

249
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,009
Take good care of your back.

250
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,889
I know

251
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,231
how fragile it is.

252
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,970
Have a safe trip.

253
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:52,191
We

254
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,311
will not meet again.

255
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,790
Yang.

256
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,510
Take care.

257
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,311
Lass.

258
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,790
Don't cry.

259
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:26,671
I'm not crying.

260
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,790
I'm not.

261
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,630
I'm all fine.

262
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:38,551
Here, make way.

263
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,052
Trinkets for sale.
Come and check them out.

264
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:44,889
Here.

265
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,351
Have a look at these. Check them out.

266
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:00,136
Trinkets and accessories for sale.

267
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:02,034
Check them out.

268
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,750
That's so not you.

269
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,231
Why aren't you having garlic?

270
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:18,311
Why are you back here?

271
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,351
I returned

272
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,591
for these delicious noodles.

273
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:24,351
You rascal!

274
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,831
You lied to me again!

275
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,409
You

276
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,970
are worse than

277
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,311
both Li Da and Sui Wen!

278
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,870
Xiaojiu.

279
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,750
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,831
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:54,951
You won't leave again, no?

282
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:57,990
I'll stay.

283
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,510
The Commanding Officer
received the intel

284
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,609
saying that there's been

285
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,750
a new mysterious force named
Taipinghui here in Dragon Town.

286
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:08,300
And it might pose a threat
to the Northern Expeditionary Army.

287
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,390
Thus, I was ordered to stay here

288
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,311
to look into that.

289
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:16,970
Xiaojiu.

290
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:19,071
I hereby invite you to join us.

291
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,409
After all,

292
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,030
we make perfect partners.

293
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,850
I'm not joining.

294
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:29,071
That's too dangerous.

295
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:34,570
I used a lot of my connections

296
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:36,529
to get this Jinling Jade Brew

297
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,910
from Nanjing.

298
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,270
It's a token of my apology to you.

299
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,951
I'll think about it.

300
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,351
However,

301
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,150
let's make one thing clear.

302
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,630
This time, I'll lead the investigation.
You have to do as I say.

303
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,071
Deal.

304
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:55,551
You mentioned

305
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,431
about joining you guys.

306
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,071
Who else are there?

307
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,529
Who else could it be?

308
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,231
Of course it's us.

309
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:04,810
Mister.

310
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,591
Two more shredded chicken noodles.

311
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:09,850
I may not be good at this.

312
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,210
But I'd like to propose
a name for our group.

313
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,630
And it's...

314
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,030
The Unstoppable Flaming Wheels
Detective Quartet.

315
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,270
Tsk.

316
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,210
What kind of lousy name is that?

317
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,970
It took me one whole night
to come up with it.

318
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,810
It's such a powerful name.

319
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:24,330
You see.

320
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,850
The Unstoppable Flaming Wheels

321
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:26,951
Detective...

322
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,951
I actually find it nice.

323
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,510
Come on, Luoluo.

324
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,290
For real?

325
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,129
Luoluo.

326
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,270
Do you really think that's a good name?

327
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,450
But

328
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,390
it should be a trio.

329
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,810
Indeed.

330
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,129
Luoluo, is that a smile?

331
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,930
Look!

332
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:44,231
Luoluo is smiling at me!

333
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,609
Considering
how lovestruck Liao Sheng is,

334
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,711
I don't think he should join us.

335
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,570
I'm serious.

336
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:51,649
Indeed.

337
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,369
Please don't.

338
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,570
After all,

339
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:56,210
I'm the owner of Liao Press
of Dragon Town.

340
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,431
You need my informants
for investigations.

341
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,030
That's not necessarily true.

342
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,170
That's not necessarily true.

343
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:02,249
- I'm off.
- Come.

344
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,210
Let's go!

345
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:04,090
Mister,

346
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:04,889
he will pay.

347
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,110
He will pay.

348
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,270
That's not very nice of you.

349
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,551
Aren't you going to have noodles?

350
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,769
My presence will only make this group

351
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,790
a strong and mighty one!

352
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:31,491
(The End)
