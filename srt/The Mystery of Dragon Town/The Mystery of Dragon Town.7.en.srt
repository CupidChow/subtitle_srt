It was you.

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,339
You gave
the young master's body to that ghost.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,299
Today,

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,619
you two are going on the road.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,380
With his soul as the guide,

22
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:03,091
bring the young master's
body back to the Yu family.

23
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:04,771
Do it.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,459

25

28
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,170
like you're some expert?

29
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,019
Let her go.

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,780
All right.

31
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,090
I'll tell them to let go.

32
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,980
He's a cop.

33
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,939
He won't shoot.

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,140
If you're hoping for a reward,

35
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,450
keep going.

36
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,780
If you don't let us go now,

37
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,370
my gun won't show mercy.

38
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,099
Lead the soul into the underworld.

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,019
Lead the soul back to where it belongs.

40
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,140
The one who leaves, shall leave.

41
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,851
The one who returns, shall return.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,260
Didn't expect that.

43
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,250
You're actually a pretty good shot.

44
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,930
You all right?

45
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,260
Of course not.

46
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,739
Another half a minute

47
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,891
and I'll be sipping Meng Po's soup.

48
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,499
You got lucky.

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,660
You just happened to strike
the binding soul formation's...

I...

54
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,011
I guessed.

55
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,660
Anyway,

56
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:38,771
thanks for this.

57
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,370
I owe you one.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,451
Let's go.

00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,491
Little girl.

62
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:56,731
You've stirred up some serious trouble.

63
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,970
I wonder how the investigation is going.

64
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,220
You messing with us?

65
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:52,140
Master Yuan isn't
even in the private room.

66
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:53,731
If you won't talk,

67
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,339
I'll take you to the station

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,090
and see what you're really up to.

69
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,739
Officers, please.

70
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,579
I honestly don't know.

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,339
Business was booming tonight.

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,779
I sent him to the room,

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,220
arranged a girl,

74
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,891
and didn't think much of it.

75
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:08,820
Right.

76
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:09,899
That Master Yuan,

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,339
he doesn't

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,011
just go to my place.

79
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,011
He might've gone to Yutang House
on the west side of the city.

80
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,610
Lately,

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,619
he's been going there all the time.

82
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,891
Yutang House?

83
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:24,151
(Yutang House)

84
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,571
I'll go in first.

85
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,211
You wait out here.

86
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,020
What?

87
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:32,980
Why should I?

88
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,011
I helped find the clue too.

89
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,900
Didn't you see

90
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,850
what kind of people
are going in and out of there?

91
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,211
Doesn't matter if they're human
or ghost, we need to go in.

92
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,980
Sorry,

93
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,460
we don't serve strangers here.

94
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,739
You need a referral

95
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,699
from an existing guest.

96
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,170
I'll pay five times more.

97
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,900
Please escort them out.

98
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,170
This way, please.

99
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,730
I...

100
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:05,251
Let go of me.

101
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,619
What are you doing?

102
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,980
Taking advantage of me?

103
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,811
Who are you calling sweetheart?

104
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,011
A toad lusting after a swan.

105
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,100
Pretty sure it's the other way around.

106
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:14,780
Besides,

107
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,499
do you even have the money
for your big mouth?

108
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,860
All bark, no wallet.

109
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,179
All bark, huh?

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,780
How do you know I'm broke?

111
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,610
I meant what I said...

112
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,970
Who the hell is that?

113
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:24,891
We can't just

114
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,730
keep searching like this.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,691
Then what do we do?

116
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,251
Go flirt with one of the staff.

117
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:34,571
Me?

118
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,251
Come on over.

119
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,730
Get over here.

120
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,050
Let go of my hand.

121
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,650
That's your way of flirting?

122
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,660
Well, it clearly worked.

123
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,580
Hey,

124
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,730
take it easy.

125
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,059
If you don't want to die,

126
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,179
cooperate.

127
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,299
Answer what I'm asked.

128
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,290
Got it?

129
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,251
I've got a friend.

130
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,410
She's a medicine girl from Miaojiang.

131
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,691
Ever heard of them?

132
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,179
She often gives me

133
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,730
little bugs and stuff.

134
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,211
These bugs,

135
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:15,811
once they crawl into your ear,

136
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,139
they eat your flesh,

137
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,379
drink your blood,

138
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,490
burrow into your heart,
and gnaw your bones.

139
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,179
Don't move.

140
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,540
Let me blow on it a little,

141
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,850
so it crawls in deeper.

142
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,420
Ask whatever you want.

143
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,379
I'll tell you.

144
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,730
I'll tell you.

145
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,371
Where is Master Yuan?

146
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,490
First floor, left side.

147
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,530
The last private room down the hall.

148
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,170
Let's go.

149
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,290
What about the bug?

150
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,059
Haven't you heard the saying?

151
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,819
A woman's mouth

152
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,050
is full of sweet lies.

153
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,050
Move.

154
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,411
Master Yuan.

155
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,051
Who are you?

156
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,970
You're not the one
who gave me the corpse that night.

157
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,691
I am Master Yuan.

158
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,531
You two,

159
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,691
you don't work here, do you?

160
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,331
(Detective ID)
We're detectives.

161
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,779
We're investigating the case
of Yu Shuang and He Shanshan.

162
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,411
We need your cooperation.

163
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,691
The house at No. 3 Huaixi Road.

164
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,090
It's yours, right?

165
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:13,250
Yes.

166
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,331
But I rented it out a while ago.

167
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:16,411
To whom?

168
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,730
Don't tell me you rented it to a ghost.

169
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,730
How did you know?

170
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,139
The tenant...

171
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,130
It

172
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,451
was a ghost.

173
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,610
I remember

174
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,370
the night before last,

175
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,211
someone offered
a high price to rent my house.

176
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:34,211
Of course I agreed.

177
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,899
We agreed to meet

178
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,171
at the house to sign the deal.

179
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,010
Thank you, Master Yuan.

180
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,130
This way, please.

181
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,770
My lady would like to see you.

182
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,539
I have deep affection
for the young master of the Yu family.

183
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,250
I wish to be joined
with him in marriage.

184
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,980
Thank you, Master Yuan,
for lending us your home.

185
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:07,610
Please accept this rent
as a token of our gratitude.

186
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,531
As for the money,

187
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,811
I didn't even check it.

188
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,130
The next day,

189
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,850
when I woke up,

190
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,490
I found myself

191
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:27,451
inside a black coffin at the mass grave.

192
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,291
After that,

193
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,411
I read the newspaper.

194
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,250
Then I knew

195
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,379
something had happened in that house.

196
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,970
The young master of the Yu family

197
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,980
died suddenly in that house.

198
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,779
(A lovesick ghost turned into a Zhan)

199
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,259
And that female ghost

200
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,811
turned into a Zhan.

201
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,970
She fooled the funeral folks

202
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:57,139
and arranged
a ghost marriage with the corpse.

203
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,370
I was terrified and full of regret.

204
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,811
Later on,

205
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,250
someone with real skill gave me advice.

206
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,370
So I dug a wishing well right here

207
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,691
in Yutang House.

208
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,451
I've been coming here every day
to burn incense and pray.

209
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,931
I just hope the ghost
and Young Master Yu

210
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:24,811
won't come after me again.

211
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,060
Take a good look.

212
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,019
I'm the one from the funeral shop.

213
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,250
That Zhan never fooled me.

214
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,770
You're from the funeral...

215
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,139
You...

216
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,180
Aren't you a cop?

217
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,019
You two...

218
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,250
You what?

219
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:40,370
You're just talking nonsense.

220
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,010
The spirit world is sacred.

221
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,180
You can't speak recklessly.

222
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,100
What's

223
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,220
that person name?

224
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,220
What did

225
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,531
that woman look like?

226
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,180
The name she wrote was

227
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,460
Song Wen.

228
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,211
But the woman had an umbrella.

229
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,850
I couldn't see her face.

230
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:04,700
In Xiangxi,

231
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:07,850
there are no wells
built in an octagonal shape.

232
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,331
The eight trigrams form a barrier.

233
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,730
A lotus pattern seals the top,
anchoring it from below.

234
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,221
The number eight belongs to
the metal element and the color white.

235
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,400
(The Sweet Dew Spring)
The well draws water from underground.

236
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,090
Metal pressing down on water,
this is clearly a death trap.

237
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,499
According to the secret arts of Lvshan,

238
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,539
this is recorded as

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,659
the Eight Trigram
Lotus Soul-Stealing Array.

240
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,831
(Commanding Talisman)

241
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:33,490
It says here,

242
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,090
"Dui Yuan Yisheng."

243
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,520
Dui symbolizes soul possession.

244
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,840
The characters for "one" (yi)
and "life" (sheng) are written together.

245
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,640
The horizontal stroke
of "one" sits atop "life",

246
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,880
symbolically blocking
the soul's passage into the afterlife.

247
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,380
As for the sweet dew spring
that follows,

248
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,010
it is nothing
like the sacred water used in Buddhism.

249
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,850
Hunger flares like fire.

250
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,411
Jealousy blazes bright.

251
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,331
One chants only of sweet dew,

252
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,010
knowing nothing else.

253
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,411
The anguish runs deep,

254
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,691
and defies all words.

255
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,880
This is a forbidden ritual
from the Datuoniluo sect,

256
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,651
used to possess
and then seal evil spirits.

257
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,340
This well was never
meant to grant blessings.

258
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,850
It is a soul well
designed to take your life.

259
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,051
Someone is trying to kill you.

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
♪Misty moonlight in Xiangxi's night♪

261
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,640
