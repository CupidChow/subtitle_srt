=The Mystery of Dragon Town=

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,540
=Episode 16=

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,970
Those two men...

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,771
Those two men

15
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,171
aren't from the Medicine King Valley.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,531
They're from Dragon Town.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,450
How do you prove it?

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,620
Thanks to my good sense of smell.

19
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:10,379
The hair oil they use

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,500
is Dragon Dankang Osmanthus Oil,

21
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,131
which isn't found anywhere else.

22
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,051
That's the Sidan Hall's brand.

23
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,491
And it's expensive.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,579
And they're the only ones

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,980
in the Medicine King Valley

26
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,579
who use that hair oil.

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,891
Isn't that strange enough?

28
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:49,530
- Get in the thorny bed!
- Get in the thorny bed!

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,500
The Medicine King Valley's rule

30
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,340
is scary indeed.

31
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,379
If he rolls over that bed of thorns,

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,659
his flesh

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,251
will be softer than pig's head meat
stewed all night.

34
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,040
This is the black tea
unique to Medicine King Valley.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,999
It's made with leaves picked from
deep within the Miao mountain villages.

36
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,891
and processed through multiple steps.

37
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,731
Please have a taste.

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,171
Miss Shi.

39
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,380
The wounds on the two deceased
have clean and smooth edges.

40
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,520
That means they were killed
with a single strike.

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,560
A regular villager like him
couldn't have managed that.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,891
And if he ends up dead,

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,451
we may never find the truth.

44
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:38,571
Whether he lied or not,

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,650
or if he's got anything
to do with the murder,

46
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,571
the Nuo deity will decide that.

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,739
If he is guilty,

48
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,700
the Nuo deity's spikes will
pierce through his bones and flesh.

49
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,820
If he is innocent,

50
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,970
the Nuo deity's spikes
will not hurt him.

51
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,499
I've heard about you.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,700
You are quick-witted,

53
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,660
composed,

54
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,011
and good at turning the tables.

55
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,860
That makes you the role model
of us women.

56
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,810
What is your name?

57
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,571
My name is Long Xiaojiu.

58
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,011
Miss Jiu.

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,970
I learned that
you're Ma Gu's disciple.

60
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:12,491
I'm not...

61
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,810
Of course I am.

62
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,100
Do you know Ma Gu?

63
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,420
We never met.

64
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:21,690
But I've heard a lot about her.

65
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,179
Your courage is admirable.

66
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,171
Why don't we

67
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,051
catch up at my place?

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,690
Sure.

69
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,370
Miss Shi.

70
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,930
He's dead.

71
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,731
That's a sinner
who infuriated the Nuo deity.

72
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,120
Prepare for the sacrificial ritual.

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,019
I have to appease the Nuo deity

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,250
to ensure our valley's safety!

75
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,410
Miss Shi!

76
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,131
Miss Shi!

77
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,691
Are you all right?

78
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,900
Thank you for your help.

79
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:49,891
Zhao Lin.

80
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,059
Tend to Miss Shi's injury.
She needs to rest.

81
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,251
Just leave this to me.

82
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,698
Please excuse me.

83
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,100
I am Mr. Zhong from the Shi Residence.

84
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,571
On behalf of our Head of family,

85
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,571
I thank you all for your help.

86
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,619
There'll be a modest banquet
at the residence this evening.

87
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,900
It's a token of our appreciation.

88
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,850
We look forward to your presence there.

89
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,530
Be careful.

90
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:18,540
Don't worry.

91
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,860
Miss Shi is beautiful and kind.

92
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,400
She's also an admirer of your master's.

93
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,891
That should be fine.

94
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,640
I'll go check out the village tonight.

95
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,080
Let's see if I can find any clues
related to the Soul Grass there.

96
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,934
No one must know about it.

97
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,545
- Let's go.
- Go.

98
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,280
What were you looking at?

99
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,371
I wasn't looking at you.

100
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,191
(Shi Residence)

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,451
This way.

102
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,281
Please.

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,939
Miss Shi is redressing her injury.

104
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,900
She'll be right here.

105
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,691
Please wait for a moment.

106
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,090
I'm having a stomachache.

107
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,379
I need to use the outhouse.

108
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,020
This way please.

109
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,160
Let me show you the way there.

110
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,730
Here.

111
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,850
Please.

112
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:19,891
Hold on.

113
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,530
I forgot something.

114
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,811
What?

115
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,371
The box.

116
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,699
Toilet paper, huh?
You should've told me sooner.

117
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,340
The Shi Residence is huge.
They should have toilet paper here, no?

118
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:36,371
Go ahead.

119
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,090
What a peculiar village.

120
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,090
Every household has candles lit
at the doorstep.

121
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,251
The doors remain open.

122
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,011
Why does it look like

123
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:02,451
they're summoning some spirits here?

124
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,451
Miss Luoluo.

125
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:08,780
Stay behind me.

126
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,619
And be careful.

127
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,811
I'll protect you.

128
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,699
Otherwise,

129
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,610
she...

130
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,090
Luoluo.

131
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,170
Where is she?

132
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,290
Luoluo.

133
