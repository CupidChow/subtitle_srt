=Episode 22=

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,690
I never expected

14
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,010
to be defeated by you two.

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,650
Shoot me.

16
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,611
Just you wish.

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,971
You wanted to turn me
into a wax figure, huh?

18
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,330
If so,

19
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,251
what should I turn you into?

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,090
You and your sharp tongue.

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,930
Once I turn into a vengeful spirit,

22
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,289
I'll rip off your tongue!

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,410
Just you wish.

24
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,809
I won't kill you.
You won't be able to turn into a spirit.

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,810
Luoluo, say,
what should we turn her into?

26
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,411
Let's turn her

27
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,570
into a flesh paper doll.

28
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,971
She'll follow you
as you do your funeral rites.

29
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,610
I think

30
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:44,130
that sounds pretty good.

31
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,809
That's right.

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,170
You must dry her under the sun
before turning her into a doll.

33
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,330
It'll make her uglier.

34
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,691
Ma Gu did take in
an excellent disciple.

35
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,770
Why didn't I kill you

36
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,010
together with her?

37
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,929
Do you wish to know

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,170
the true cause of your master's death?

39
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,611
Do you truly think
it was just an accident?

40
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:07,491
- What are you trying to say?
- Shi Youruo!

41
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,611
Shut up!

42
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,130
Why can't I speak?

43
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,451
I'm merely stating the facts.

44
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,889
Why do you think those thugs

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,130
were able to locate Jingtian
and Ma Gu?

46
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:18,489
They did so under my arrangement!

47
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,530
Luoluo, no!

48
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,930
You know how to get to them, right?

49
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,250
- Yeah.
- We do.

50
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,810
Open the door! Save me!

51
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:30,729
Come out!

52
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,530
Come out!

53
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,169
Open the door!

54
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,410
Shi Jingtian, come out!

55
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,810
Shi Jingtian, come out!

56
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:35,370
Come out!

57
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,530
Come out!

58
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,690
Shi Jingtian!

59
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,931
- Come out!
- Open the door!

60
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,530
Jingtian would never fall for me

61
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,690
as long as Ma Gu was alive!

62
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,850
She deserved to die!

63
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,771
I wanted to kill her long ago.

64
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:01,009
She was killed by my arrangement.

65
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,410
It's my fault for not
being ruthless enough!

66
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,291
I should've killed you as well!

67
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,690
Jingtian.

68
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,090
I'm coming to join you.

69
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,130
One of them is selfish

70
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,611
while the other is despicable.

71
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,771
They're a perfect match.

72
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,090
It's just

73
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,130
that Ma Gu died a wrongful death.

74
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:33,530
Everything's fine now.

75
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,650
I...

76
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:36,530
I'm fine, aren't I?

77
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,011
Where did Sui Wen take you?

78
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,811
I was so worried about you.

79
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:45,330
I think I didn't tell you

80
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:46,650
that I was going to take this path.

81
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:47,689
How did you find out?

82
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,011
Who else can it be?

83
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:51,251
It's me.

84
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,011
Xiaojiu,

85
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,451
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,210
You were involved in

87
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,011
such a dangerous plan because of me.

88
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,891
You know that it's dangerous too, huh?

89
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,251
All those plans of yours,

90
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:05,131
you didn't tell me about it beforehand.

91
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,490
Xiaojiu almost died
because of you, you know?

92
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,610
Stop reprimanding him.

93
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,010
I was the one who wanted to join him
and Deputy Mayor Tian

94
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,410
after finding out about their plan.

95
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:16,249
It's just that I never expected Sui Wen
to take my body

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,010
even after I faked my death.

97
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,170
Luoluo is right.

98
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,050
I was too reckless.

99
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,571
I thought too highly of myself.

100
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,970
What's going on?

101
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,490
Deputy Mayor Tian?

102
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:33,771
So,

103
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:34,811
in the end,

104
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,809
Shi Youruo is dead.

105
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,050
She deserved it.

106
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,129
I hate myself for not being
able to avenge my master sooner.

107
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,251
Shi Youruo actually tailed us
all the way here.

108
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,170
I've underestimated her.

109
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,610
We've underestimated

110
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,011
Deputy Mayor Tian as well.

111
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,410
He truly deserves

112
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,050
the respect of the people.

113
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,571
Yeah.

114
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:56,929
How did Liao Sheng react

115
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,931
to the incident, then?

116
00:05:58,211 --> 00:05:59,251
Him?

117
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:01,571
He sobbed profusely.

118
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,290
Mr. Tian, you're a symbol of justice!

119
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:04,931
I, Liao Sheng,

120
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,331
will respect you forever!

121
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,729
So,

122
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,850
have you

123
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,530
made contact with Black Snake?

124
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,451
Look at this.

125
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,691
Isn't this the wild flower
we found by the road?

126
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,211
This is Soul Grass.

127
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,090
Soul Grass?

128
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,850
What's going on?

129
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,129
Yang,

130
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,371
sorry for the wait.

131
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,090
This...

132
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,811
What happened?

133
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,211
I didn't expect that apothecary

134
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,771
to sneak into the police station
without our knowledge.

135
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,131
I was careless.

136
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,771
She's just an apothecary.
What can she do?

137
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,489
I can make her vanish anytime

138
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,131
as long as you want it.

139
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,131
She knows sorcery.

140
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,530
It's hard to deal with.

141
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:05,290
In Dragon Town,

142
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,970
if anyone dares to obstruct us,

143
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,571
forget about an apothecary
who knows sorcery.

144
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,331
I can even change
the chief of this station

145
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,970
if he's the one obstructing us.

146
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:18,771
Commissioner Li?

147
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:21,170
What are you doing here?

148
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,490
Didn't you want to see me?

149
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:25,811
I'm Black Snake.

150
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,650
So, Commissioner Li, it's you.

151
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,169
I knew it.

152
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,650
Who else could set up

153
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,211
such an elaborate plot?

154
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,251
Detective Yang, you're too courteous.

155
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,290
Let's cut it short.

156
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,211
I came here today

157
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,490
to discuss our collaboration.

158
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,450
But now, we have a huge problem.

159
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:51,290
The Commanding Officer
will be visiting our town soon.

160
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,691
He was the one who sent me here.

161
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,530
It's easy to dupe him.

162
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,331
We can sell our opium

163
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,691
as long as I can lure him away.

164
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,489
By then,

165
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,530
we can sell as much of it as we like.

166
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,691
Opium is just a second-rate commodity.

167
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,931
Only poor people buy that.

168
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,410
Second-rate commodity?

169
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,609
What is this?

170
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,211
This is Soul Grass.

171
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,571
So, this is Soul Grass.

172
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,090
It looks just like a wild flower.

173
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,609
No wonder we didn't notice them

174
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,050
when we were passing by.

175
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:32,890
This is the true cause

176
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:35,291
of the deaths
of all those victims, right?

177
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,770
It may be tiny,

178
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,129
but the pleasure and dizziness it brings

179
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,610
are far stronger than that
of a thousand opium poppies.

180
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,490
Really?

181
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:49,531
If so, doesn't that mean
you guys have struck a fortune?

182
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,889
However,

183
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,211
the mortality rate
of this drug is too high.

184
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,609
Therefore,

185
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,171
we've been experimenting
with it before this.

186
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,729
We can only use opium first

187
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,691
to build up the customers' tolerance.

188
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:04,250
You've been to my brothel before, right?

189
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,490
So, you guys selected rich customers
from the brothel

190
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,360
and lied to them

191
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
that they can extend their lifespan
by attending the soul descent ritual.

192
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,609
But actually,

193
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,051
you guys are merely feeding them
opium to build their tolerance.

194
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,930
That scum, Tian Zhen,

195
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,531
was bent on cracking down opium.

196
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,531
I had no choice but to conduct
my experiment at the cinema.

197
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,331
That's a lab.

198
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,409
Because the use of Soul Grass

199
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,370
requires careful,
step-by-step experimentation,

200
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:31,291
we used opium to build their tolerance.

201
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:32,970
For Soul Grass,

202
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,529
we've managed

203
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,090
to distill its oil.

204
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,210
It can be injected into
the human body directly

205
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,889
or be dropped into water
and taken orally.

206
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,690
If the dosage is slightly
higher than usual,

207
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,850
in less than ten minutes, the victim
will die from massive internal bleeding.

208
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:46,930
However,

209
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,529
as long as the dosage is just right,

210
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,211
paired with a trace of morphine,

211
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,889
it'll provide one

212
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,691
with the ultimate sensory experience.

213
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,531
If so,

214
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,610
were these Soul Grasses

215
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,730
grown at Medicine King Valley?

216
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,451
But I didn't

217
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,571
find a single clue there.

218
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,769
When you guys were seizing the cinema,

219
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,811
I already instructed them
to stop the refining process.

220
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,411
Don't worry.

221
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,691
We've ceased our operation.

222
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,250
Even if they're here,

223
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,770
they won't be able to find anything.

224
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,531
If so,

225
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,729
did you guys arrange for

226
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,691
Mr. Jingtian's death as well?

227
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:25,090
Shi Jingtian

228
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,610
wasn't a suitable business partner.

229
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,369
He always hesitated

230
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,250
to do this business deal with us.

231
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,009
He's slightly mad as well.

232
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,649
He has contributed to my cause.

233
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,171
I won't do anything to him.

234
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,730
However, I cannot stop someone else
from taking his position

235
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,730
at Medicine King Valley.

236
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:53,850
Sui Wen.

237
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,529
What are you staring at?

238
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,970
Hurry and uncuff me!

239
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,490
You...

240
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,970
What do you mean by this?

241
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:05,610
Wait!

242
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,211
Did you not kill her?

243
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,730
Sui Wen.

244
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,409
Stop joking around.

245
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,770
I tried so hard to lure Shi Youruo
out of the valley, you know?

246
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,090
You actually didn't kill her?

247
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,451
What are you up to?

248
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:25,250
Shi...

249
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,531
Ms. Youruo.

250
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:27,729
Ms. Youruo.

251
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,010
Let me explain.

252
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,610
I...

253
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,331
That's not it.

254
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,291
Let me explain.

255
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,250
Let me explain!

256
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,090
Sui Wen!

257
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,571
You didn't keep your promise!

258
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,090
Zhao Lin's body

259
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,970
is right under Mr. Zhong's bed.

260
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,890
I'll bring you to it later.

261
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,610
Ms. Youruo.

262
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,529
Ms. Youruo.

263
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,409
I was deceived.

264
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,850
I was deceived!

265
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,210
It's all because of him.

266
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:57,369
It's all because of him!

267
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,691
He instigated me to do everything!

268
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,490
I've let Mr. Jingtian down.

269
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,409
Ms. Youruo,

270
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,290
please spare me

271
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,529
on account of my years of service

272
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,129
at Medicine King Valley!

273
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,090
Ms. Youruo!

274
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:07,850
Ms. Youruo!

275
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:08,931
Ms. Youruo!

276
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,810
Someone like him,

277
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:17,370
who is opportunistic,
always looking to climb higher,

278
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,330
and willing to do anything to get ahead,

279
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:21,930
never speaks the truth.

280
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,211
We never even considered him
in the first place.

281
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,890
Did you know how Jingtian died?

282
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,531
It's because he colluded

283
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,211
with the four outsiders.

284
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:37,489
The Medicine King Valley cannot survive
without the Shi family.

285
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,931
And, we only acknowledge the Shi family.

286
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,970
What if I don't want
to join hands with you?

287
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,450
Do you really think Mr. Zhong

288
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,931
couldn't replace the Shi family?

289
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:57,090
We'll help you avenge Shi Jingtian.

290
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,811
Black Snake has high hopes for you.

291
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,489
You're different from Shi Jingtian.

292
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,171
He only knows how to make medicine
but doesn't understand business.

293
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,889
From now on, he hopes

294
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,730
that his business will be a part
of Medicine King Valley.

295
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,931
Is that okay,

296
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,931
Ms. Youruo?

297
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,531
Show me the corpses
of the four outsiders.

298
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,250
No problem.

299
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,290
From now on,

300
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,531
we'll transport the real goods.

301
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,571
They sacrificed Zhao Lin to lure us out.

302
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,970
I thought

303
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:31,451
it was a feint.

304
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,570
But in reality...

305
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,651
Something else was going on.

306
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,210
You guys did so
to conceal the presence of Soul Grass.

307
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,250
If so, now...

308
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,451
The goods have already
arrived at my warehouse.

309
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,090
We're refining them as we speak.

310
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,729
The president had no choice

311
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,451
but to be wary of you
in the first place.

312
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:55,370
So now, if we manage to lure
the Commanding Officer away,

313
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,050
we'll be able to make it big together.

314
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,490
That was my initial plan.

315
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:01,811
But now,

316
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,970
there's a change of plans.

317
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,770
I'm going to murder him.

318
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,370
You want to get rid
of the Commanding Officer?

319
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,760
That's impossible.

320
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,690
It might be difficult
for someone else to achieve that.

321
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,170
But to you,

322
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:21,009
it's a piece of cake.

323
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,570
You're his subordinate.

324
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,570
You're also the one
who can get closest to him.

325
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,609
As long as you mix some
Soul Grass powder

326
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,129
into his cup of water,

327
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,171
his death will be the same as the rest.

328
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:33,010
People will think
that he was killed by a vengeful spirit.

329
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,330
Once you accomplish that,

330
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:37,370
I'll give you half of the annual profits

331
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,571
from the Medicine King Valley.

332
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,730
Please give me some time
to consider this.

333
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,370
What should we do about his army, then?

334
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,571
You don't need to worry about that.

335
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,769
The Security Regiment
has set up an ambush.

336
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,729
By then,

337
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,250
they'll be sleeping with the fishes.

338
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,651
If Soul Grass can

339
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,811
bring us that much profit,

340
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,770
I'll get rid of the Commanding Officer
on your behalf.

341
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,490
Excellent.

342
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,370
After the mayor's election tomorrow,

343
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,850
you can follow me to the trade site.

344
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,362
You'll know
when you see it for yourself.

345
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:22,769
(Taibai Hall)

346
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,571
Everyone.

347
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,769
The deployment of the Security Regiment

348
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,490
is more complicated
than we had anticipated.

349
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:29,970
Beishan is their command center.

350
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,649
(Dragon Town)

351
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,811
Nanshan and Dongshan
serve as mutually reinforcing corners.

352
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,850
Once our operation
to capture the mayor fails,

353
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,010
they'll form a crossfire pattern

354
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:39,490
and attack Dragon Town.

355
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,051
They'll attack here, here, and here.

356
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,090
The good news is that the Commanding Officer
has arrived at the neighboring county.

357
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,129
Now, we just need to deliver
the Security Regiment's deployment map

358
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,850
to them as soon as possible.

359
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,609
Once they eradicate Li Dazui

360
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,970
and fire the flare,

361
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:53,850
we can

362
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,210
proceed with our operation

363
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,411
at the warehouse.

364
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,691
If not,

365
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,730
we will be wiped out.

366
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,409
If so, we have to act quickly.

367
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,931
We mustn't give Li Dazui and his men
any time to react.

368
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:05,769
This is

369
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,291
their blind spot.

370
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:09,610
We should be able
to infiltrate their ranks.

371
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:11,610
However, we mustn't let down our guard.

372
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:14,570
Their patrol follows irregular routes.

373
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:15,691
They're hard to predict.

374
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:17,931
I'll deliver the map.

375
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:20,290
Currently, I know the paths
through the deep mountains the best.

376
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,360
The chances of me
getting them out are the highest.

377
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,010
Liao Sheng.

378
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,291
This time, I'll deliver the map.

379
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,009
Xiaojiu,

380
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,450
Liao Sheng knows
the terrain here the best.

381
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,559
That's right, Xiaojiu. Li Dazui won't
fall for it even if we were to deliver the map

382
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,160
under the guise of
a corpse transportation.

383
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,850
I have a reason to be there.

384
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:39,890
Liao Sheng,

385
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:41,850
you have something more important to do.

386
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:43,890
Think about it.

387
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,850
Even if Li Dazui doesn't
attack Dragon Town in time,

388
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:48,769
with Li Da's influence and connections,

389
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,331
he can confront us

390
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,890
even after he's arrested.

391
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,609
If the newspaper
doesn't report the truth

392
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,811
and let the public know

393
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,931
what really happened,

394
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:58,811
it'll be hard

395
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,810
for us to proceed with our operation

396
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,130
after raiding the warehouse.

397
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,730
Therefore, Liao Sheng,

398
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,050
your pen

399
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,490
is much more important
than those tiny legs of yours.

400
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,280
That's our priority.

401
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,050
As for the mission of
delivering the map out of Dragon Town,

402
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,369
according to the current situation,

403
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,969
I'm the most suitable
candidate for the task

404
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,570
no matter

405
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,171
how you look at it.

406
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,290
But...

407
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,411
Stop being wishy-washy.

408
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,490
I know how to avoid their patrol.

409
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,691
I'll be careful.

410
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,010
And,

411
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:26,090
I got my fortune read.
Good things will happen.

412
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:26,730
Lass,

413
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:28,171
I trust you.

414
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,371
But you must be careful.

415
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,851
Xiaojiu is right.

416
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,250
Liao Sheng's news

417
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:35,449
can give legitimacy to our actions.

418
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,891
That's what he's supposed to do.

419
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:39,851
Alright.

420
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,211
I'll entrust the map to you, then.

421
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,970
Right now,

422
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,290
the most crucial part

423
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,929
is the arrest plan for the warehouse.

424
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,969
Yang Ziqi,

425
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,290
have you made up your mind?

426
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:14,810
Search the place thoroughly.

427
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,091
Okay.

428
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:18,320
- I think there's someone up there.
- You must be mistaken.

429
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,250
Nonsense. I saw a woman up there.

430
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,171
You must've lost your mind
thinking about women.
