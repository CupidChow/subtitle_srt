=Episode 1=

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,831
(Joybringer crossing)
(Deep in the mountains of Xiangxi,)

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,511
(once night falls,)

15
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,151
(strange and unclean things
always crawl out from the forest.)

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,831
(The living avoid them at all costs.)

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,319
(But strangely,)

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,239
(there's always
a certain kind of people,)

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,231
(neither storm nor thunder,)

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,431
(can stop them
from night walk in the mountains.)

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,750
(They don't seem afraid
of these mountain spirits and demons.)

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
(Or maybe)

23
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,440
(those dark entities are the ones)

24
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,310
(who fear them.)

25
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:06,920
Dao.

26
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,039
We're making a fortune.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,390
Not bad tonight, Dao.

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
These two corpses, once we
sell them to Medicine King Valley,

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,191
think we'll get ten silver dollars?

30
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,351
Search them.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,400
What a couple of broke corpse herders.

32
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,791
And they died pretty quick too.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,511
Quit acting all spooky.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,631
What spooky nonsense.

35
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:28,830
I cut him down with one strike.

36
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,359
Bro, he's not alive.

37
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,960
If that's a corpse,

38
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:47,110
then what's that behind you?

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,960
Ghost!

40
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,390
Ghost!

41
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,830
Someone's really bold enough
to steal a corpse?

42
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,780
(Xiaojiu, funeral shop girl)

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,691
Medicine King Valley? What is that?

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,079
Sorry about that, mate.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,639
Didn't mean for you to get kicked twice.

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,471
I'll take you home in a bit.

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,830
All right.

48
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,830
Let's go home.

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,359
We'll have to leave here

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,870
before it starts raining.

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,851
(Taibai Hall)

52
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,880
Master.

53
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm back.

54
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,630
I brought you
some Wang family sorghum liquor.

55
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,959
No.

56
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,600
You

57
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,759
just call me old man.

58
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,680
Look at you,

59
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:38,231
all grown and capable now.

60
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,560
I just thought Liang Yinrong

61
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,630
died far from home.
It's really sad, isn't it?

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
And his friend told me

63
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,759
there'd be a big reward
once I delivered him.

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,711
I figured since your legs aren't well,

65
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,319
I should just work a bit harder,

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,319
push through a bit more,

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,911
and earn you some liquor money.

68
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,240
That's a nice excuse.

69
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:59,000
Earning me liquor money?

70
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,880
And you dressed up as a corpse herder?

71
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,279
In all of Dragon Town,

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,870
you've got the biggest guts.

73
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,600
You've no idea.

74
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:06,800
Last night I almost

75
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,120
got killed by bandits.

76
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,519
And I still brought you liquor.

77
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,271
You weren't even worried about me.

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,750
So where's the money?

79
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,190
Don't ask.

80
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:21,591
After all that work,
I didn't earn a single coin.

81
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:22,951
He's not allowed in the village.

82
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,400
A man who played women on stage

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,260
isn't worthy of being buried
in my family's plot.

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,560
It brings bad karma.

85
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,680
Whether he enters
the village or not isn't my concern.

86
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:34,480
But, I disguised myself as a corpse herder
and brought your son all the way here.

87
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't even charge you
a transport fee. You should be grateful.

88
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,190
Now hand over the money.

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,519
I don't recognize him as my son.

90
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,279
I'm not paying you.

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,719
You...

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,110
Hold on.

93
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:43,670
That guy...

94
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:45,990
You're not gonna
bury him yourself, are you?

95
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,480
Enough. Next time...

96
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,031
Next time, I'll get it right for sure.

97
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,190
No.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,510
There better not be a next time.

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,639
You

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,959
just stay put
and wait till my leg heals.

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,591
Then you'll work funerals with me.

102
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,911
You're not ready to go solo yet.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,310
You don't believe in me.
Still don't believe in me.

104
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:19,110
You...

105
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,231
Drank the whole thing.

106
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,190
And you left me just one sip.

107
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:48,990
You want a funeral done?

108
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,031
Mm.

109
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,990
My younger brother
passed away in the city.

110
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,719
I'd like to ask Master Jiu

111
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,079
to bring him home
to our clan from the city

112
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,440
and hold a proper funeral.

113
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,831
Let him rest in peace.

114
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,151
Another case like this?

115
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,759
It's doable.

116
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,630
But we take payment upfront.

117
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,070
Master Jiu, how much is the fee?

118
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,440
Six silver dollars.

119
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,550
No haggling, no credit.

120
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,750
This is for Master Jiu.

121
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,519
Here's the thing.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,040
My master is out doing a funeral.

123
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,480
Right now in the whole shop,

124
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm the only one who can handle the job.

125
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,870
- If that's not acceptable, forget it.
- Wait.

126
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:34,951
If Miss Jiu is willing,

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,951
then that's fine as well.

128
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,591
All right.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,959
We'll hold the funeral
at our clan estate.

130
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,870
Yes.

131
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,750
Keep everything simple.

132
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,870
Please make sure

133
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,120
(The deceased: Yu Shuang)
to deliver my brother

134
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,471
to the Meng residence by midnight tonight.

135
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:55,791
No problem.

136
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,190
Aren't you coming with me?

137
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:03,839
Old man,

138
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,870
when you wake up and see this money,

139
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,680
you're gonna be scared to death.

140
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,520
That's what you get
for not believing me.

141
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,320
This time I'll listen to you.
Let's draw a fortune first.

142
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,030
Midnight hour.

143
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,750
The departed returns home.

144
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,551
I'm here to collect
the body for the funeral.

145
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,351
Why isn't it Master Jiu?

146
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,431
I'm Master Jiu's top disciple.

147
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,671
I'll handle this.

148
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,471
All right.

149
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,071
This way.

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,880
This is...

151
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,711
He's already been dressed and wrapped.

152
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,071
A black mandarin jacket?

153
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,211
(Spirit tablet of Yu Shuang)

154
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,951
You even shaved his hair?

155
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,551
Everything is ready.

156
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,910
You just need to bring him back, Master.

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,351
He died of a terrible illness?

158
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,110
Dropped dead suddenly.

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,390
Please take him now, Master.

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,990
The family's waiting
to start the funeral tonight.

161
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:12,919
(I don't care anymore.)

162
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,831
(It's a good omen anyway.)

163
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,671
Young master has returned home.

164
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,759
Master.

165
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,910
Please come in.

166
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:31,759
Thank you, Master,

167
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,480
for bringing Shuang back.

168
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:34,591
Lin,

169
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,831
give Master some extra money
for the effort.

170
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:37,951
All right.

171
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,880
No need.

172
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,750
Didn't you already pay me?

173
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,559
Then,

174
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,799
when will

175
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,311
we start

176
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,720
the funeral?

177
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:05,600
Also,

178
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,591
where is the altar set up?

179
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,311
Should we first

180
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,320
move the deceased
onto the blessing board?

181
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,990
And what about the burial pillow...

182
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,790
Miss Jiu,

183
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,671
there's no need for you to worry
about the burial.

184
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,990
This is joy money.

185
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,671
Take it.

186
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,431
Thank you
for helping me fulfill my wish.

187
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,390
Joy money?

188
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,551
Isn't this a funeral?

189
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,759
You don't need
to trouble yourself, Master.

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,390
We can handle it ourselves.

191
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,510
Then...

192
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,279
Then I'll just
take a look at the deceased

193
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,519
and help with the burial.

194
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,711
That won't be necessary.

195
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,480
See the Master out.

196
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,510
Please.

197
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:48,270
Please.

198
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,990
Please.

199
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,360
Young Master Yu,

200
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,431
how did this turn into a happy funeral?

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,600
♪Misty moonlight in Xiangxi's night♪

202
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,800
♪Fog veils the entire Dragon Town♪

203
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,560
♪Corpse herders drift like fleeting shade♪

204
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,640
♪Hurrying down the nether road♪
