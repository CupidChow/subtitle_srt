13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,709
Creepy.

14
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,719
Creepy.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,230
This is way too creepy.

16
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:11,958
You again?

17
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,838
Let go of me,

18
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,758
you lunatic!

19
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,189
I let you get away once.

20
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,949
Not this time.

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,189
Psycho.

22
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:24,719
What the hell

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,549
are you doing here
this late, Detective Yang?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,999
Don't tell me

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,478
the killer's

26
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,198
crying thief?

27
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:33,189
She was already dead when I got here.

28
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,559
Then why are you here

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,150
this late?

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,318
What, came back

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,359
to admire your handiwork?

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,949
Watch your mouth!

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,630
Look clearly

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,469
at what she's wearing.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,079
Don't you pin this on me.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,829
This is Black Maoshan.

37
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,070
So what?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,838
I remember

39
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,910
it was in
our family's Forbidden Rites manual.

40
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,870
This is a real ghost-killing ritual.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,829
What kind of grudge was this?

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,838
It means

43
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,638
they wanted to trap her soul

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,030
so she couldn't even become a ghost.

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,510
Look.

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,109
A red dress for soul-weighting,

47
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,350
scale weights to bind the soul,

48
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,999
suspended three inches above ground

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,918
to make sure

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,190
the soul can't return to the earth.

51
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,559
And the soul-trapping cage on her head

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,470
was made from corpse oil.

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:27,829
The cage has been opened.

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,470
That means

55
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,518
someone already
used a gourd or some container

56
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,358
to take away her soul.

57
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,719
As for why

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,239
it's hung on the door handle.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,318
That's because

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,439
it's hard to extract
every bit of a soul.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,549
You have to stimulate it with yin wood.

62
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,879
That's the only way

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,630
to make the ritual work.

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,638
Nonsense.

65
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,389
Utter superstition.

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,669
Yeah.

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,478
Detective Yang's got skills.

68
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,159
Solving a case

69
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,030
without even thinking like the killer.

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,839
Fine.

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,358
Since you don't believe me,

72
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:59,439
we'll investigate separately.

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,709
See you around.

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,358
Detective Yang,

75
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,959
I won't get in your way,

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,230
so don't get in mine.

77
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,269
Let go.

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,839
I need to find Yu Shuang's body.

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,518
Yu Shuang's body is missing,

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,038
rumors about his ghost bride,

81
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,630
and He Shanshan was killed.

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,119
All these cases

83
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,829
are connected to you.

84
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,518
You're the prime suspect.

85
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,190
If you want to clear your name,

86
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,839
then help me

87
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,310
get to the bottom of all these cases.

88
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,959
Yang Ziqi,

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,630
this is your idea of cooperation?

90
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,269
There was a better way,

91
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,638
but you didn't choose it.

92
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,790
Screw you!

93
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,630
Get back here!

94
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,829
Detective Yang.

95
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,669
Please come back.

96
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,439
It's cold.

97
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,279
Give me a blanket.

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,230
Nope.

99
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,198
Fine.

100
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,959
Then you'll know exactly how I'll answer

101
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,070
your questions later.

102
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,119
What's that smell?

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,310
Detective Yang?

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,958
He Shanshan's body
has been taken to the station.

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,270
What do we do now?

106
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,069
Send her to the morgue.

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,869
Right, Detective Yang.

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,749
We've already called Li the coroner.

109
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,718
He used to be

110
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,749
our local forensic examiner in town.

111
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,838
We're a small town,

112
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,638
not like the big cities out there.

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,910
Just say it.

114
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,078
I'm saying, we should go ahead
and autopsy her.

115
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,280
If we find nothing,

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,240
- I'll take full responsibility.
- the family...

117
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,470
Do the autopsy.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,638
Yes, sir.

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,790
Yang Ziqi!

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,398
Are you crazy again?

121
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,359
What are you doing?

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,989
You want to cut her open?

123
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,599
She should be buried whole,

124
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,758
with her body intact.

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,039
You want to dissect her

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,479
just to solve a case?

127
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,799
If the He family comes storming in,

128
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,198
don't come begging me

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,439
to stitch her back together!

130
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,158
Where's that Detective Yang?

131
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:02,999
Come out!

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,270
Come out now!

133
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,030
Get out here!

134
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,830
Come on.

135
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,559
Yang!

136
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,989
Uncle He, what are you doing?

137
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,309
Director Wu!

138
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,509
It was him!

139
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,509
He's the one who stopped me from seeing
my daughter at the newspaper office!

140
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,270
Yang! Just because you
were transferred from higher up

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,350
doesn't mean you
can throw your weight around.

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,158
Do you even know who I am?

143
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,518
Even Director Wu

144
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,960
shows me respect.

145
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,200
What gives you the right
to stop me from seeing my daughter?

146
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,599
Crime scenes must not be disturbed.

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,398
That's procedure.

148
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,879
If you barge in

149
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,270
and mess up the evidence,
how are we supposed to solve the case?

150
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,879
Your daughter
died horribly in the office.

151
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,518
I did this

152
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,509
to help bring her killer to justice.

153
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,718
If Director Wu
is polite to you, that's his choice.

154
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,039
But with me,

155
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,509
rules are rules.

156
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,999
You think I'm beneath you?

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,390
I've got people
in the provincial capital!

158
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,270
Who do you think you're yelling at?

159
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,039
Director Wu.

160
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,950
Look at him.

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,470
Liu.

162
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,439
Uncle He.

163
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,590
Come on.

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,359
About Miss He's death...

165
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,119
Let's talk inside.

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,189
It's just so strange.

167
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,350
You need to look into it, right?

168
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,429
Detective Yang,

169
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,838
the people dying in our town lately,

170
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,119
they all come from powerful families.

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,518
Not the kind we can offend.

172
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:12,999
You can't...

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,429
That has nothing to do with me.

174
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,390
And nothing to do
with the investigation.

175
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,999
Don't they want the truth?

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,869
You...

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,749
Forget it.

178
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,278
The way He Shanshan died was terrifying.

179
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,078
She was murdered.

180
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,109
Obviously.

181
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,429
I...

182
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,590
Dear heavens.

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,309
What do we do now?

184
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,120
If this keeps up, we might have to
call in some Taoist priests

185
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,838
and hold a ritual right
in the police station.

186
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,790
Director Wu.

187
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,069
I don't believe in that stuff.

188
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,518
I just mean

189
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,398
that the town's

190
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,198
getting ready
to elect the next mayor soon.

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,830
If we can let these cases slide,
then let them slide.

192
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,790
Less trouble is better than more.

193
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,439
If not,

194
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,078
and the higher-ups
hear about the bad press,

195
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,509
the one who gets screwed will be me.

196
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,359
Just in case.

197
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,710
Just in case.

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,679
Uncle He.

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,790
Director Wu.

200
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,230
Today,

201
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,030
I must see my daughter.

202
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,350
I'm her father.

203
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,559
All right.

204
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,590
I have the right to!

205
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,718
Come.

206
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,910
This way.

207
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,390
Mr He,

208
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,629
you've seen the body.

209
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,158
I promise I won't let your daughter

210
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,629
die without justice.

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,599
Can you promise

212
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,599
my daughter

213
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,270
won't just vanish like that wretched boy

214
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,549
from the Yu family?

215
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,270
You have my word.

216
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,150
The director can vouch for it.

217
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,790
Mr He,

218
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,318
let's talk outside.

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,559
Shall we?

220
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,999
Come on.

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,559
Let's go.

222
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,679
Come.

223
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,749
Let's go.

224
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,629
Detective.

225
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,830
Master drank too much yesterday.

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,429
He's still not up yet.

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,479
Shall we just lock the body up for now,

228
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,150
and start
the autopsy tomorrow first thing?

229
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,199
Do you know

230
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
where your daughter was heading?

231
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
(Clearance Pass)
She prepared all these documents.

232
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,999
She never said a word to me.

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,079
She was just fine.

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,430
Why would she leave?

235
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,599
So your daughter

236
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,678
and Young Master Yu,

237
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,879
how did they meet?

238
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,999
Back when I was

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,230
doing tea business with the Yu family,

240
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,470
the two kids got to know each other.

241
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,398
Later on,

242
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,350
they became a couple.

243
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,350
What about the child bride,

244
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,438
Meng Lin?

245
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,149
That's Yu family business.

246
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,479
I'm not too sure.

247
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,830
What I mean is,

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,830
was Meng Lin widely known?

249
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,070
The Yu family is a big name.

250
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,119
Everyone knew

251
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,629
about their child bride.

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,230
And your daughter,

253
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,599
did she and Yu Shuang
have any mutual friends or enemies?

254
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,470
That...

255
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,989
I really don't know.

256
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,999
You're her father

257
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,149
and you don't know?

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,149
Let's leave it there for now.

259
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,839
If there's any update,

260
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,398
I'll inform you immediately.

261
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,550
All right.

262
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,798
All these recent deaths in Dragon Town,

263
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,629
none of them were nobodies.

264
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,029
Liu.

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,678
Send more officers to that
fake Yu Residence tomorrow morning

266
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,950
and continue the investigation.

267
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,638
You got it.

268
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,670
Detective Yang,

269
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,518
I don't believe for a second

270
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,070
that there are no witnesses.

271
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,918
(Worker Record. Name: Wu Qingzhi)

272
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,070
Detective Yang.

273
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,638
Detective Yang!

274
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,789
Detective Yang!

275
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,079
Detective Yang,

276
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,350
we've got a lead!

277
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,670
I'm starving. I want food too.

278
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,789
At least you have a conscience.

279
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,430
Detective Yang,

280
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,079
the newspaper where He Shanshan worked,

281
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,590
its outer wall is under repair.

282
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,866
(Name: Wu Qingzhi)
This is the list

283
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,480
(Name: Wu Qingzhi)
of construction crew workers.

284
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,479
At the breakfast stall,

285
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,518
I caught one of the foremen

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,749
and asked him.

287
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,319
This old Wu guy,

288
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,398
something's off about him.

289
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,230
Others charge
three silver dollars a job.

290
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,918
But him?

291
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,839
Just one.

292
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,430
Just to get into the crew.

293
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,319
And what's weirder,

294
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,310
the foreman told me

295
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,389
this old Wu carried

296
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,430
a straw doll

297
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,710
with He Shanshan's name on it.

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,319
I'm guessing

299
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,190
he might be cursing her.

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,029
Liu,

301
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,029
you've got potential as a proper cop.

302
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,950
Darn right.

303
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,389
Wouldn't have guessed.

304
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,119
Sui'an Village.

305
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,190
Where is it?

306
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,670
I've never heard of it.

307
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,558
Beg me if you want.

308
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,909
I know where it is.

309
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,678
How do I know

310
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,758
you're not lying?

311
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,350
Believe it or not.

312
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,278
I've done plenty of funerals

313
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,470
in remote backwater villages.

314
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,398
This place?

315
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,950
I just happen to know it.

316
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,629
Come with me to find the lead.

317
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,158
Once we find it,

318
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,550
I'll let you go.

319
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,109
Nice try.

320
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,438
That's how you ask for help?

321
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,909
You're something else.

322
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,190
I'm warning you.

323
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,590
You're chained to me now.

324
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,109
Good luck with that.

325
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,190
No funny business.

326
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,638
I hope your brain

327
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,758
works as well

328
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,230
as your mouth.

329
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,749
Let's go.

330
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,470
Detective Yang.

331
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,959
Oh, my god.

332
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,389
Steel spine, huh?

333
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,749
Aren't we there yet?

334
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,109
Up ahead.

335
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,670
What happened

336
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,710
to this place?

337
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,470
Excuse me, sir.

338
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,479
Do you know

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,749
someone named Old Wu?

340
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,239
Is he from your village?

341
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,789
Old Wu?

342
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,509
You mean Wu Qingzhi?

343
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,109
Yeah.

344
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,509
He's from our village.

345
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,509
But he's been dead for over a year.

346
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,629
That's impossible.

347
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,310
People in town said they saw him.

348
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,430
Are you sure

349
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,869
the Old Wu you saw

350
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,389
was even human?
