=Episode 13=

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,620
Let me go!

14
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,500
Are you okay?

15
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:12,620
I'm fine.

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,900
Wait here.

17
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:29,060
I'll go after him.

18
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,301
Sui Wen?

19
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,541
Yang Ziqi.

20
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:50,780
Yang Ziqi!

21
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:51,739
Yang Ziqi!

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,780
Are you okay?

23
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,620
Are you shot?

24
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,260
Don't worry.

25
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,461
I'll survive.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,140
Luckily, the bullet
struck my pocket watch.

27
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:10,040
This won't do. Your condition
is much more serious than mine.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,480
I'll send you to the hospital.

29
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:20,781
There's no escape!

30
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:31,499
Industrial Department,

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,941
Deputy Chief Zhang!

32
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,980
Dengxian Tower,

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,900
Mr. Jia!

34
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,700
Tax Bureau,

35
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,980
Mr. Sun!

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,501
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,
Minister Qiao!

37
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,941
Hurry and release them!

38
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,381
I just left not long ago,

39
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,779
yet that Yang Ziqi

40
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,220
created such a huge mess.

41
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,179
Tell him

42
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,339
to stop acting recklessly!

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,980
I...

44
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:54,579
I...

45
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,619
I...

46
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,899
I...

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,381
Put him through.

48
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,220
Detective Yang

49
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,019
has been sent to the hospital.

50
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,140
What?

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,101
That fool.

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,100
Enough.

53
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,260
Hurry and release them.

54
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,940
- But Detective Yang instructed me to...
- Instructed you? So what?

55
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,300
I can instruct you too!

56
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,019
Is he an idiot?

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,739
Do you know that these people
could plunge Dragon Town into chaos

58
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,700
if they joined hands?

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,941
Listen to me.

60
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:18,339
Release them first.

61
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,460
After that,

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,820
send them home one by one
with our vehicle.

63
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,700
Remember!

64
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,899
Do it in secret.

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,020
Understood?

66
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:27,821
Yes, sir!

67
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,300
You're awake.

68
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,980
It's too early for you

69
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,621
to grieve.

70
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,541
Go away.

71
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,860
Was everyone arrested?

72
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,821
White-Faced ran away.

73
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:16,980
But Meng Wei was arrested.

74
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:18,220
He's the one who opened the door

75
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,619
and tried to shoot me.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,821
That's great.

77
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,700
What about the rest?

78
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:24,819
Liu released them.

79
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,140
He said the chief called
and threatened him.

80
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,780
What gives?

81
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,140
All of them are either officials
or influential figures!

82
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:34,939
Yang Ziqi, you can get yourself
in trouble if you like.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,080
But don't drag the entire
police station down with you!

84
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,780
That's what the chief said.

85
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,981
I merely repeated it.

86
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,381
These officials shield each other

87
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,100
and collude to commit crimes.

88
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,020
All those that were seized,

89
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,819
were they opium?

90
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,220
Yeah, all of them.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,619
The pills you guys took

92
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,179
were all made from opium paste.

93
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,220
All of them are
in the police station now.

94
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,040
By the way, Detective Yang, just now,

95
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,800
someone delivered a letter
to our station.

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,741
He designated that it was
for you and Miss Xiaojiu.

97
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:06,821
For me?

98
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,580
Here you go.

99
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:21,001
(Tomorrow, 11 A.M., Luoxian Forest)

100
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,081
(Bring Meng Wei here
if you want your master back.)

101
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,821
My master was kidnapped.

102
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,061
What exactly is going on?

103
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:33,301
A few days ago,

104
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,220
my master went out
on an expedition by foot.

105
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,421
He encountered

106
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,621
a group of soldiers
stationed just outside the town.

107
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:48,939
(So, they're from
the Security Regiment.)

108
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,421
Sui Wen said I have to bring Meng Wei there
if I wanted my master back.

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,179
Yang Ziqi,

110
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,259
I know you want to find out

111
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,739
who's the mastermind behind this case.

112
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,340
However,

113
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,139
this concerns

114
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,580
my master's life.

115
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,100
Can you...

116
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,220
Yes.

117
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,140
Thank you.

118
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,580
Time.

119
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:26,660
And location.

120
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,941
10 A.M. tomorrow.

121
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,700
At Luoxian Forest, outside the city.

122
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
It's you.

123
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,780
You opened the door for me.

124
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,741
I can never forget your face.

125
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,381
Did you guys mistake me
for someone else?

126
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,621
Your father is Meng Yuanshan, right?

127
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,220
Your mother, Zhou, is bedridden.

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,179
You have a brother
who's ten years younger than you.

129
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,699
His name is Meng Yu. He's very intelligent.

130
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,699
Your entire family

131
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,819
placed high hopes on him.

132
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,120
What do you mean by that?

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,499
You guys have been passing off
murders as supernatural phenomena.

134
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,400
I'm sure the truth is terrifying

135
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,560
judging from the way
you guys are concealing the truth.

136
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,460
But, what if,

137
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,139
the mastermind knows

138
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,660
that you, Meng Wei,
confessed at the police station?

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,699
I wonder if he'll try

140
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,179
to silence you
in order to conceal the truth?

141
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,739
Don't spout nonsense.

142
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,059
Since when did I confess?

143
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,980
I know nothing.

144
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,059
I'm the one

145
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,340
making the call here.

146
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:30,840
Look.

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,340
(Meng Wei Suspected of Murder and Drug Trafficking)
Read the newspaper title.

148
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,640
(Shocking Confession)
It's ready.

149
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,100
Wait.

150
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,819
Do you think they'll believe that?

151
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,980
Let's make a bet, then.

152
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:40,340
Your life is on the line anyway.

153
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,860
But if you do die,

154
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,739
will your parents

155
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,780
suffer the same fate?

156
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:46,739
Will Meng Yu

157
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,699
be murdered by

158
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,100
vengeful spirits?

159
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,900
Yang,

160
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,381
what nonsense are you talking about?

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,421
How dare you call yourself a cop?

162
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:57,941
Sorry.

163
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,939
I'm not a cop.

164
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,619
All is fair in love and war.

165
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,061
Any trick is fair game.

166
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,939
If you confess, I'll send your family
to the Commanding Officer

167
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,460
and place them under his protection.

168
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:09,619
Maybe

169
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,020
I can even help you to stay alive.

170
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,540
What do you think?

171
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,100
I know nothing.

172
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,981
I don't know anything
about what they did.

173
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,260
If so, why did those nobles
and high-ranking officials

174
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,540
go to the cinema

175
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,140
to attend the soul descent ritual?

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,100
All those rich fools were worried
that they couldn't use up their fortune

177
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,259
before death.

178
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,180
After our hypnosis,

179
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,400
they even dreamt

180
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,701
that they could do business deals
with the ghost messengers.

181
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,060
You guys finally found

182
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,180
what you were looking for

183
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,540
in He Shanshan's body, right?

184
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,341
What are you talking about?

185
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,659
I don't know what you are talking about.

186
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,820
Don't worry.

187
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,180
You just need to tell me what you know.

188
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,300
Did you guys

189
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,340
silence Mr. Yuan

190
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,621
because he saw you guys?

191
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:06,499
That mysterious woman

192
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,739
isn't a child bride ghost.

193
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,461
Who exactly is she?

194
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,820
She's not even a woman.

195
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,621
It's a man.

196
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
It's Sui Wen!

197
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,381
You don't need
to worry about the burial.

198
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,981
This is my gift money to you.

199
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,420
Take it.

200
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,980
Thank you all for attending

201
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:35,461
my wedding with Meng Lin.

202
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,341
No wonder.

203
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,140
I see now.

204
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,101
I was wondering why.

205
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,621
All of us have

206
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,340
the same features.

207
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,379
I was wondering why she looked weird.

208
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,341
So, it turns out that she was a man.

209
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:56,060
If so,

210
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,180
Sui Wen,

211
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,340
the white-faced freak,

212
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,981
and the child bride ghost,

213
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:01,580
all of them are the same person.

214
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,340
What exactly are you guys hiding?

215
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,980
I truly have no idea.

216
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,899
- Sui Wen was the one behind everything.
- What about Yu Shuang?

217
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,180
Why did you guys kill Yu Shuang?

218
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:10,480
Where's his body?

219
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,741
He deserved to die since he saw something
that he wasn't supposed to. His body?

220
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,460
Didn't you guys deliver it
to Sui Wen yourself?

221
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:19,461
You guys murdered all of these victims.
What's the deal with their eyeballs?

222
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,019
I don't know anything.

223
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,139
Sui Wen was behind everything!

224
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,981
I told you already!

225
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,981
Now,

226
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,621
I'm going to return you to Sui Wen.

227
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,499
He kidnapped our men.

228
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,341
He requested you in exchange for him.

229
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,940
Yang Ziqi,

230
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,700
you tricked me!

231
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,419
Now, your only choice

232
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
is to keep cooperating with us.

233
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,060
If Sui Wen finds out

234
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,900
that you told us everything,

235
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,180
he'll definitely silence you.

236
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,341
What do you think?

237
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,501
Promise me this.

238
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,820
You must take care of my family.

239
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,701
Once we're there,

240
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,539
investigate the points

241
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,860
I had pointed out

242
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,300
and tell me about them.

243
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,899
Wait.

244
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,101
Detective Yang,

245
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:25,060
if we release him,

246
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,820
how can we face Chief?

247
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,820
I'll bear all of the responsibilities.

248
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,820
Release him.

249
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,820
You guys at least have to be sincere

250
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,501
for the hostage exchange.

251
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,221
Uncuff me.

252
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:44,739
What are you doing?

253
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,060
You want me to uncuff you, right?

254
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:47,539
No one does that.

255
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,140
You're so brutish.

256
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,060
What are you doing?

257
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,220
You mustn't release Meng Wei!
You mustn't!

258
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,420
Why?

259
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,619
I have Master Jiu with me.

260
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,700
Sui Wen lied to you!

261
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,900
What?

262
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,700
They're out of ammo!

263
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:30,460
Shut up!

264
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:33,160
I only want to write about news.
I don't want to be featured in one!

265
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,640
If it doesn't work out,
I'll fight them with my bare hands.

266
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,040
Have you lost your mind?
You'll never be as fast as their guns.

267
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,820
We can't just wait here
for our demise, right?

268
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:03,501
Retreat!

269
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:21,940
Deputy Town Mayor.

270
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:26,820
Don't move!

271
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,060
Xiaojiu?

272
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,660
- What are you doing?
- Xiaojiu!

273
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,300
Xiaojiu?

274
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,261
Xiaojiu.

275
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:33,540
Put down the knife.

276
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,180
You were the one who requested Master

277
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,780
to drive the corpses out of town, right?

278
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,419
- I'm not the person you're looking for.
- Master Jiu.

279
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,820
This concerns whether or not

280
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,261
Xiaojiu is able to locate
Yu Shuang's body.

281
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,619
Why would there be a place
for my master to rest

282
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,341
while transporting corpses
in your newspaper firm?

283
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,899
Did you scout the location in advance?

284
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,019
And, how was it possible
for you to show up in the nick of time

285
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,460
when we first went to Yutang House?

286
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:01,539
Who exactly are you?

287
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Tell me!

288
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,880
♪Misty moonlight in Xiangxi's night♪

289
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,080
♪Fog veils the entire Dragon Town♪

290
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,840
