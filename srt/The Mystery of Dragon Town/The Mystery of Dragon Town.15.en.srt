=The Mystery of Dragon Town=

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,540
=Episode 15=

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,719
Wake up, Meng Wei!

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,839
Don't scare me!

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,430
Please wake up, Meng Wei!

16
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,029
Detective Yang.

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,830
It's the Soul Grass.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,309
Why didn't you do your job?

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,709
Didn't I say no one was allowed in here?

20
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,859
It was only a nurse who came
to replace the medicine.

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,318
Then I saw Meng Wei was sound asleep.

22
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,359
After a while, he went crazy.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,559
And he ended up this way.

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,630
A nurse?

25
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:08,870
Was it

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,510
an extremely pale-faced one?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,879
I guess so.

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,949
That must be Sui Wen.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,270
When did he leave?

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,719
About

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,719
20 minutes ago.

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,669
Give chase!

33
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,519
Yes, sir!

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,589
Get back here!

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,318
You chase after that nurse.

36
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,279
Send our men to the Meng Family Village

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,519
and get Meng Wei's family here.

38
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,439
Go now!

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,309
Yes, sir!

40
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,359
Luoluo.

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,519
You mentioned

42
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,398
about Meng Wei

43
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:38,910
and the Soul Grass.

44
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,439
What did you mean by that?

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,350
He was killed by the Soul Grass.

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,639
To put it simply,

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,710
it's a magical ancient herb.

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,038
It was found

49
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,318
in Shanshan's body,

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,919
leading the Yin Sting Bug into it.

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,398
Once the box is opened,

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,678
the bug inside

53
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,189
will get into one's body.

54
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,238
That means

55
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,589
their deaths

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,439
have something to do

57
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,829
with this Soul Grass.

58
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,790
Luoluo ever said

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,159
that the Soul Grass was last seen

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,310
during the Ming dynasty.

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,559
It was

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,829
at the Medicine King Valley.

63
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,198
According to Meng Wei,

64
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,030
that's where Sui Wen picked up sorcery.

65
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,350
Looks like

66
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,159
we must make a trip

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,669
to the Medicine King Valley.

68
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,109
What's this?

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,310
What's that?

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,510
Who are you?

71
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,239
We're the herb traders passing by here.

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,800
It's said there are exotic plants
in the Medicine King Valley.

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,590
So we'd like
to get some for our business.

74
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,318
Don't you see this dead body here?

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,709
Do you have a death wish?

76
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,070
So,

77
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,318
what's going on here?

78
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,638
Those in the Medicine King Valley

79
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,798
always get rid of bodies here.

80
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,318
It's an autonomous zone.

81
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,149
No one knows what's happening in there.

82
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,798
We who used to live nearby

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,959
have all moved away.

84
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,429
None of us dare get near it.

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,030
Is it that dangerous?

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,269
This bird

87
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,389
flew all the way here
from the Medicine King Valley.

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,070
Whoever gets pecked by it

89
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,549
will go insane. No exception.

90
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,070
And this scarecrow

91
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,038
is used

92
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,030
to chase these birds
away from the paddy fields.

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,358
Heed my advice

94
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,869
and leave here immediately.

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,070
Let's go.

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,829
I've got it figured out.

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,158
(Henian Hall)
This is the only place

98
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:18,710
where visiting herb traders can stay.

99
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,030
There are all kinds of people in there.
So be cautious.

100
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,638
Don't worry.

101
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,718
I'd be exposed

102
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,439
as nothing but a undertaker.

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,559
As for Luoluo,

104
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,239
she is a healer.

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,278
That'd mean

106
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,439
we're in the same field.

107
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,158
We could sit together, exchange ideas,

108
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,359
and have a chat.

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,119
It's even possible that

110
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,629
our ancestors knew one another.

111
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,679
Exchange ideas?

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,718
How?

113
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,599
Haven't you heard of this saying?

114
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,999
I'd rather give ten strings of coins

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,599
than pass down my craft.

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,629
I'd rather give a whole ingot of gold
than teach a single spring couplet line.

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,150
Mister.

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,919
We're new here,

119
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,150
and we're inexperienced.

120
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,499
Where do we buy herbs in this valley?
And what herbs do we have here?

121
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,210
(Zhao Lin, Storekeeper)
Is this your first time here?

122
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,758
The herbs from Medicine King Valley

123
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,989
aren't always the same.

124
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,078
Their varieties change with the seasons.

125
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,278
Outsiders

126
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,710
can't access the valley.

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,439
On the sixth day of each month,

128
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,838
those in here

129
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,198
will bring their herbs

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,549
to sell outside my inn.

131
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,879
It's the fifth day of the month.

132
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,599
Tomorrow's the day, then?

133
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,549
Yes.

134
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,509
That's why I say you're lucky.

135
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,958
Also, tomorrow's a big day

136
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,760
because the second head of family
is coming too.

137
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,718
That's why we've
had many lodgers here today.

138
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:48,669
They're all here for tomorrow's deal.

139
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,270
Mister.

140
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,629
Well,

141
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,989
can we get the opium poppy here?

142
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,710
We're running a proper business here.

143
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,030
We don't sell

144
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,390
those dirty stuff.

145
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,629
Just asking.

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,150
Just asking.

147
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,390
What's this?

148
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,749
Xiaojiu.

149
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,390
The Yin Sting Bug
exhibits a special reaction

150
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,039
in the presence of the Soul Grass.

151
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,879
The closer it gets to the grass,

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,509
the stronger its reaction.

153
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,629
Does your friend

154
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,429
hate me?

155
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,278
You want to befriend her?

156
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,158
That's easy.

157
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,790
Just castrate yourself and be a woman.

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,109
Was she hurt by some man?

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,359
Nonsense.

160
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,989
She's never been in a relationship.

161
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,359
It's her master,

162
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,509
Ma Gu.

163
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,230
When Ma Gu was young,

164
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,109
she had a lover.

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,679
They ran into the bandits
during their trip.

166
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,158
To save his own skin,

167
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,109
that man locked Ma Gu outside.

168
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,910
You men, huh?

169
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,679
Wait up,

170
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,989
Luoluo!

171
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,479
Come on, Luoluo.

172
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,479
Does the bug even work?

173
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,278
We're deep in the woods,

174
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,629
but it's not working at all.

175
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,470
Don't you find it strange?

176
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,230
On our way here,

177
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,710
we've only come across herb traders.

178
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,830
Not a single herb gatherer was in sight.

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,710
It's possible

180
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,669
that they learned about it in advance.

181
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,078
It will take us ages
searching like this on the outskirts.

182
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,710
Why don't we think of a way?

183
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,278
We can approach the head of family

184
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,669
and get to the root of it.

185
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,030
That'd be too risky.

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,119
We know nothing

187
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,669
about both the Medicine King Valley
and the Shi family.

188
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,919
If we want to do that,

189
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,239
we need to investigate

190
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,390
and get to know them.

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,470
Tomorrow's event

192
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,030
is our opportunity.

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,470
What do you want?

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,078
Calm down.

195
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,439
Let's see what they want.

196
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,638
Don't come near us!

197
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,278
We...

198
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,919
We're just normal businesspeople.

199
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,989
Don't come near!

200
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,910
That's too much, Xiaojiu.

201
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,509
Liao Sheng?

202
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:35,389
Get back here.

203
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,629
What's going on here?

204
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,719
Mister.

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,109
These four people

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,239
killed my brothers.

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,149
I saw it with my own eyes.

208
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,629
This is nothing but a defamation!

209
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,599
Mister.

210
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
My family has lived
nearby the valley for generations.

211
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,119
You do know me well.

212
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,558
Why would I slander some strangers
for no reason, right?

213
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,398
Fine.

214
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,909
If you saw it with your own eyes,
please tell us when and how we killed them.

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,149
Half an hour ago,

216
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,119
the three of us were in the backyard

217
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,758
counting our remaining money

218
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,749
to be used to purchase herbs tomorrow.

219
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,119
The four of them

220
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,999
got greedy

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,319
and attempted to rob us.

222
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,909
They beat my brothers to death.

223
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,239
Fortunately, I ran away.

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,999
Mister,

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,479
if you don't believe me, search them.

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,869
I'm sure the money is with them.

227
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,710
That's right.

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,190
This is my money.

229
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,629
You!

230
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,319
How dare you

231
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,629
slander me?

232
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,749
Fine.

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,918
Let's just say

234
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,438
you're telling the truth.

235
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,918
Why would we come back here

236
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,109
after running away?

237
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,278
Of course you came back for the money.

238
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,599
You didn't return here to save him.

239
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,950
You were just after the money.

240
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,389
You said

241
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,079
this case

242
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,149
happened half an hour ago.

243
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,158
That means

244
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,869
they died not long ago.

245
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,470
That's right.

246
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,109
Mister.

247
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,909
When someone has just passed,

248
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,638
there's still warmth in their skin

249
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,590
and the body remains flexible.

250
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,310
Given the current degree
of rigor mortis,

251
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,389
there's no way he just died.

252
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,319
Well, I remembered it wrongly.
It's been six hours since their passing.

253
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,719
We were having our meal

254
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,918
in this hall six hours ago.

255
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,959
Mister.

256
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,149
You saw us then.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,989
Everyone.

258
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,950
I bet you've heard of Ma Gu,
the greatest female healer in Miaojiang.

259
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,989
Wherever she were,

260
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,879
snakes and ants bowed to her

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,359
and rodents fled in terror.

262
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,158
Well,

263
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,749
I am her first direct disciple.

264
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,029
Do you see this precious
venomous bug in my hand?

265
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,590
Its body is covered in deadly poison.

266
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,389
Apart from me,

267
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,629
no one can touch it.

268
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,558
Go

269
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,070
and say hello to them.

270
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,789
If it touches your face,

271
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,798
your skin will rot beyond repair.

272
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,989
And if it enters your body,

273
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,038
your internal organs

274
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,599
will be ground into mush.

275
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,879
Covering your mouth won't help.

276
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,989
It can crawl in through your ear.

277
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,710
Sir!

278
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,199
Sir,

279
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,869
I killed them!

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,190
I accidentally killed my brothers.

281
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,278
I decided to frame them

282
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,438
because I didn't want
the head of family to punish me.

283
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,038
Please spare me,

284
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,319
sir!

285
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,918
Please,

286
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,319
sir!

287
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,119
Take him away!

288
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,678
Sir.

289
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,280
Deal with him
when the second head returns.

290
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,599
Sir!

291
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,789
- Have mercy on me, sir!
- Move!

292
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,670
I'm sorry

293
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,470
for having startled you all.

294
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,918
She said she was Ma Gu's disciple.

295
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,909
Youruo.

296
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,319
Do you think it's got to do
with what happened ten years ago?

297
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,509
Step back.

298
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,269
Call me Miss Shi.

299
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,070
(Shi Youruo, Second Head of Family)
Only Jingtian gets to call me that.

300
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,199
Youruo. It's been so many years.

301
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,190
The head is not going to recover.

302
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,670
She actually had a disciple?
