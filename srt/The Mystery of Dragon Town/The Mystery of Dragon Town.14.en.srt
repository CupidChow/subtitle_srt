=Episode 14=

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,160
How was it possible
for you to show up in the nick of time

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,159
when we first went to Yutang House?

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,238
Who exactly are you?

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,240
Tell me!

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,518
Deputy Mayor.

18
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,079
You better explain the situation

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,878
before Miss Xiaojiu

20
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,079
slits my throat.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,998
Xiaojiu,

22
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,918
Liao Sheng is my subordinate.

23
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,638
I had him use his position

24
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,318
to take a lot of photos for me,

25
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:00,839
including the Security Regiment's base

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,198
outside of town.

27
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:02,958
I suspect

28
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,399
that these military forces

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,319
are likely to be related
to the town mayor election.

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,479
To avoid any unforeseen circumstances,
I had him map out these locations.

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,078
Using your master's
corpse-transporting title,

32
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,638
I had him deliver these maps
to the Lu Family Army in the outskirts.

33
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:16,679
Lu Family Army?

34
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,199
You mean Lu Chao?

35
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,599
Isn't he a soldier of Li Zongren?

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,880
That's right.

37
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,158
I have some connections
with the Guangxi Regime.

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,918
So,

39
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,319
you were the one who requested Master

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,520
to transport the fake corpses
out of town.

41
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,160
That's right.

42
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,479
It's a shame that the info was leaked.

43
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,078
The Security Regime stopped him.

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,319
He almost lost his life due to that.

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,519
But I never expected that

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,319
to happen.

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,519
Therefore,

48
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,080
when I saw the corpse in the mountains,
I knew that it wasn't Master Jiu.

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Detective Yang is new to the place
and hasn't encountered Master Jiu before.

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,559
It's easy to trick him.

51
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,839
But me?

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,759
I know everything

53
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,479
there is to know about Dragon Town.

54
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,158
Master Jiu wasn't left-handed.

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,679
However, the left hand
of the corpse was full of blisters.

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,839
Therefore, I was sure
that Master Jiu was still alive.

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,080
If so, I'm sure those who want to
steal the maps can arrive at the same deduction.

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,358
And, that day, when the three of us
had a meal together,

59
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,479
I'm sure they were the ones

60
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,159
trying to get you in trouble.

61
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,799
Since they failed their mission,
they wouldn't let us off that easily.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,579
Therefore, I could only seek
Deputy Mayor's help

63
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,840
and tell him to secretly send someone
to protect Master Jiu.

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,318
However, I was one step too late.

65
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,919
Master Jiu was kidnapped by
Sui Wen's men.

66
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,598
So, who's holding my master captive now?

67
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,239
He's with us!

68
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,919
Xiaojiu.

69
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,878
You...

70
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,919
Please be careful.

71
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,800
You might hurt me by accident.

72
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,119
Now,

73
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,879
I only believe what I see.

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,878
I know fully well how good you are
at fabricating tales.

75
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,639
Therefore,

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,919
I won't trust anyone here

77
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,760
unless Master shows up.

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,839
Xiaojiu,

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,879
don't you even believe me?

80
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,480
I don't.

81
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,679
Yang Ziqi.

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,758
Listen.

83
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,598
I can speak on equal terms

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,199
with your town's commanding officer.

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,839
Do you know

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,318
that I can decide your future

87
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,760
with my words alone?

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,279
I do.

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,679
If so,

90
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,839
how dare you still go against me?

91
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,438
I choose

92
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,200
to believe the truth.

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,520
You!

94
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,600
Nobody moves!

95
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,679
This is my personal affair.

96
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,878
Don't meddle with my affairs.

97
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,459
I won't appreciate your effort. Go away.

98
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,799
I'm searching for the truth.

99
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,999
I'm not doing it for your sake.

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,640
Stop flattering yourself.

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,399
You're overthinking it.

102
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,718
You!

103
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,080
Why don't you two

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,519
release me first?

105
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,879
- Shut up!
- Shut up.

106
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,200
Lass!

107
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,800
Lass.

108
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,640
Master!

109
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,119
Calm down!

110
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,119
Don't act recklessly!

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,320
Are you okay?

112
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,359
Lass.

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
Don't be scared.

114
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,399
Deputy Mayor Tian

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
and Mr. Liao rescued me.

116
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,919
Guys,

117
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,558
I suppose

118
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,760
you believe me now, right?

119
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,799
Meng Wei,

120
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,119
next time,

121
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,519
I won't miss.

122
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,119
I won't escape.

123
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,279
I'll cuff myself.

124
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,598
Strange cases have been occurring
at Dragon Town.

125
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,358
I think there are more to these cases

126
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,079
than meets the eye.

127
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,879
It might be related
to a mysterious organization.

128
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,999
You're right.

129
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,399
And, those involved

130
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,918
include high-ranking officials.

131
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,280
No ordinary organizations
can achieve something like this.

132
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,759
I'm worried

133
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,759
that they might hatch a plot
more sinister than the current one.

134
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,480
I'm too weak
to deal with this on my own.

135
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,798
However, we're lucky
to have you guys around.

136
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,519
You guys showed me hope.

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,358
Deputy Mayor,

138
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,759
you're a great official.

139
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,999
The people of Dragon Town need you.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,439
You should be the mayor.

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,118
Whether I become the mayor or not

142
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,118
doesn't matter to me.

143
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,158
Most importantly,

144
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,920
I wish to take down
the organization lurking in the shadows.

145
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,478
Returning peace to the people

146
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,598
is my priority.

147
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,119
I hope

148
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,879
that you guys can help me out.

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,079
- Of course.
- Of course.

150
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:04,478
Meng Wei.

151
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,759
Do you know that your decision
will decide whether or not

152
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,079
you and your family will survive?

153
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,999
I believe

154
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,319
that after this incident,

155
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,678
Sui Wen's only goal

156
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,519
is to silence you

157
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,759
and your family.

158
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Detective Yang,

159
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:16,839
I had no choice either.

160
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,439
Think about it.

161
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,118
If I didn't scream,

162
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,759
Sui Wen would definitely suspect

163
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,158
that you guys had bribed me.

164
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,238
Listen.

165
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,399
Sui Wen no longer
has any bargaining chips.

166
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,358
Right now, the only way

167
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,079
to ensure the safety
of you and your family

168
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,360
is to help us arrest him
as soon as possible.

169
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Think about it yourself.

170
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,480
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

171
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Alright.

172
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,079
Wait.

173
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,679
They should be looking for

174
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,519
a card.

175
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,400
An ID card.

176
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,119
It's likely

177
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,319
that it belongs to Black Snack.

178
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,879
Black Snake?

179
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,718
He's the president
of Baishan Chamber of Commerce.

180
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,439
Baishan Chamber of Commerce?

181
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,678
Could it be that they're involved
in the opium trade?

182
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,598
The opium trade is just a ruse.

183
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,678
Sui Wen said

184
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,519
that Black Snack
has an even greater conspiracy.

185
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,280
You guys asked me why so many people
have been murdered lately, right?

186
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
It's related to that conspiracy.

187
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,280
All of them were murdered by Sui Wen
under Black Snack's order.

188
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,959
I heard from Shuang

189
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,119
that he was the secretary
of a certain chamber of commerce.

190
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,560
- Liu.
- Forget about investigating them.

191
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
You guys won't be able to find anything.

192
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,759
Baishan Chamber of Commerce
is a secret organization.

193
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,840
We all communicate
through a single channel.

194
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,439
The only person I know is Sui Wen,
who's my superior.

195
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,759
If so,

196
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,158
is Yu Shuang the secretary
of said chamber of commerce?

197
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,038
I don't know.

198
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,478
I only know that Yu Shuang

199
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,879
handed the ID card to He Shanshan.

200
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,280
He Shanshan

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,519
once stored it in a pawn shop.

202
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,678
So,

203
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,559
Mr. Wang Chuangfu was murdered

204
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,639
because he saw the ID card, huh?

205
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,879
That's right.

206
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,759
And,

207
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,439
all of the victims
died in mysterious ways.

208
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,559
How did you guys achieve that?

209
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,158
Yeah.

210
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,718
I saw Yu Shuang's body.

211
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,278
His eyes were bloodshot

212
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,678
while his complexion was pale.

213
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,999
It was Sui Wen.

214
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,119
He once studied sorcery

215
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,319
at the Medicine King Valley.

216
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,839
(Medicine King Valley)

217
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,079
(That sounds familiar.)

218
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
That's right.
I need the information of all officials

219
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,100
at or above the level of section chief
in Dragon Town for the past ten years,

220
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
including
household registration certificates,

221
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,880
appointment orders, recommendation letters,
and introduction letters.

222
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,100
I'll retrieve the info you want
from the provincial bureau.

223
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,778
This Baishan Chamber
of Commerce you speak of

224
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:29,798
might be the source

225
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,678
of the unknown forces

226
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,879
I told you to investigate
in Dragon Town in the first place.

227
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,399
Seems like things are getting
more and more complicated.

228
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,199
I found out the Security Regiment
and the Baishan Chamber of Commerce

229
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
have committed a lot of dirty deeds.

230
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,478
Baishan Chamber of Commerce

231
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,278
might be up to something more sinister.

232
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,319
I'm worried

233
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,699
that they might be targeting you.

234
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,999
Regarding the maps Deputy Mayor
had sent to the Lu Family Army,

235
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,358
can you make a copy of them
and deliver them to me?

236
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,199
It's an outdated map.

237
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Does it still provide us

238
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,038
with any value?

239
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,959
Of course.

240
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,118
By analyzing the places
they were stationed before,

241
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,038
we can try to assess
their military intentions,

242
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,079
style of operation,
and strategic thinking.

243
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,759
Are you trying

244
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,879
to create new maps

245
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
using the old ones?

246
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,999
That's right.

247
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,278
You got it immediately.

248
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,079
Alright.

249
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
I'll think of something.

250
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,600
What are you doing?

251
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm here to change
the patient's dressing.

252
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,080
Detective Yang,
your request is reasonable.

253
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,638
I have no issues with it.

254
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,518
However,

255
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,720
I have one condition.

256
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,839
In the future, whenever you investigate

257
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,998
the opium case,

258
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:40,720
Liao Sheng has
to join your investigation.

259
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,720
Your request

260
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,320
is reasonable as well.

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,199
Good to hear that.

262
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,919
If so, may we have
a pleasant cooperation.

263
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,279
Likewise.

264
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,279
But...

265
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,799
Sit down.

266
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,238
I...

267
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,240
Must we hide in a place like this?

268
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,199
There are

269
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,959
restaurants and taverns out there.

270
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,718
Even Fuchun House

271
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,119
is a good place for us to hide.

272
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,199
Why don't we

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,399
change to somewhere else?

274
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,759
What are you talking about?

275
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,718
We'll remain here.

276
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,039
It's nearest to the police station.

277
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,218
It's the safest place.
It's the best place for us to hide.

278
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:14,118
You want to go somewhere else?
Just go to sleep.

279
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,159
But I...

280
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,119
How dare you bully your master?

281
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
You'll be punished for it.

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,919
You were ruthless yesterday.

283
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,960
You almost sent me
to reunite with my great-grandmother.

284
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,999
You deserved it.

285
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,758
Who told you to trick me?

286
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,039
But...

287
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,559
That's just the interest.
I haven't paid you back for the capital.

288
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,398
Don't you think that's too much?

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,118
You're more ruthless than a loan shark.

290
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,039
Besides...

291
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,519
Who's that?

292
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,959
Luoluo?

293
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,238
What are you doing here?

294
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,639
Isn't it obvious?

295
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,758
Come here.

296
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,119
I need to speak with you.

297
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:58,839
Hello, beauty.

298
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,559
I'm Liao Sheng,

299
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,840
a reporter at a newspaper firm.

300
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,680
He's one of us. You can go ahead.

301
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,959
I know why He Shanshan

302
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,840
was stung by the Yin Sting Bug.

303
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,799
Her blood contained traces of Soul Grass,
a herb recorded in

304
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,320
ancient herb manuals.

305
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,878
Soul Grass?

306
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,238
What is that?

307
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:28,639
A unique medicine from the Miao tribe.
It has been lost for over a thousand years.

308
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,718
It's been lost for over a millennium.

309
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,279
How could you be sure that He Shanshan
had ingested it?

310
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
I've done my research.

311
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,118
No matter if it's He Shanshan,

312
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,440
Yu Shuang, Yuan Bin, or Mr. Wang,

313
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,878
their symptoms of death are

314
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,839
very similar to those caused by

315
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,119
the ingestion of Soul Grass.

316
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,519
They'll descend into madness
and be unable to feel pain.

317
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,199
They die of brain hemorrhage eventually.

318
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,319
The eyes will turn bloodshot
right before their death.

319
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,279
The last appearance of the Soul Grass

320
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,400
was during the plague
at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

321
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,638
It appeared at the Medicine King Valley,

322
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,840
which was tens of li away
from Dragon Town.

323
00:11:58,999 --> 00:11:59,919
Can you even get

324
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,559
ten silver dollars for selling these corpses
to Medicine King Valley?

325
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,200
He once learned sorcery

326
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,440
in Medicine King Valley.

327
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,878
You're very knowledgeable

328
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,399
and intelligent.

329
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,039
Miss,

330
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,598
may I know your name?

331
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,560
Another one bites the dust.

332
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,960
I hate noisy men.

333
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,559
She also hates men
who stare at people inappropriately.

334
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,600
You better watch out.

335
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,240
Yang Ziqi!

336
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,598
Great timing.

337
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,679
I have several questions

338
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,478
to ask Meng Wei.

339
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,718
I have something to tell you.

340
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,559
He Shanshan didn't take any opium.

341
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,039
She took Soul Grass instead.

342
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,480
Soul Grass?

343
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,959
Meng Wei!

344
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,560
Don't scare me!

♪Misty moonlight in Xiangxi's night♪

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
