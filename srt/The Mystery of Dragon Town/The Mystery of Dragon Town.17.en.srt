Ma Gu!

Ma Gu, where are you?

15

All of you, go away!

Shi Jingtian!

34
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:31,920
Save me!

35
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,240
- Stop right there!
- Stop running!

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,489
- Shi Jingtian! Come out!
- Open the door!

37
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,520
Open the door!

38
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:42,769
Shi Jingtian!

39
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,761
Open the door!

40
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,281
Luoluo?

41
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:48,240
Miss Jiu.

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,650
Sorry about that.

43
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,041
It must've been terrifying.

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,441
Jingtian,

45
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,881
this is Miss Jiu,
whom I've mentioned before.

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,201
Youruo.

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,609
Are you okay?

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,690
Youruo,

49
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,561
did I lose my composure again?

50
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:09,400
It must've been tough on you, Jingtian.

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,240
It's been so many years,

52
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,960
yet you've never
gotten over the nightmare.

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,321
Sorry about that.

54
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:20,281
So, you're Miss Jiu.

55
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,009
Hurry.

56
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,120
Please have a seat.

57
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,721
Let's have a seat.

58
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:30,810
Miss Luoluo

59
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,210
stumbled into
the shrine room by accident

60
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:34,920
and saw the dead.

61
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,680
Miss, don't be afraid.

62
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm Mr. Zhong.

63
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,410
Miss Luoluo, sorry for scaring you.

64
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:44,370
We're doing this

65
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:45,250
just like how people

66
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,449
burn paper dolls for people

67
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,001
in the underworld.

68
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,840
We're just trying to seek consolation.

69
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,080
Miss Luoluo,

70
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,441
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,640
There are dead people

72
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,481
in the residence?

73
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,240
My goodness.

74
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,009
(He's shaking so much.)

75
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,530
What is that?

76
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:16,770
(Is it the Soul Grass?)

77
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:17,960
(Who has it?)

78
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,241
He...

79
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,520
He has epilepsy.

80
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,489
Are you okay?

81
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,729
He's suffering from a relapse.

82
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,809
Actually, we came
to Medicine King Valley

83
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,970
to seek treatment

84
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:30,121
for him.

85
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,369
Yes.

86
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,330
I'm sick.

87
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah, he's sick.

88
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,729
You see,

89
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,169
we encounter all kinds of troubles

90
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,600
when we go outside.

91
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,040
We brought it to ensure our safety.

92
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,720
Miss Jiu,

93
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,090
in Medicine King Valley,

94
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:04,520
we don't need a gun
to resolve any issues.

95
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:05,289
You should

96
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,929
hand the gun to me.

97
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,080
I'll return it to you
when you're leaving.

98
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:17,121
Why did you make him
pretend to be my master?

99
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,049
The design of the necklace,

100
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,770
even the design of the outfit,

101
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,681
they look just like my master's.

102
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,080
So, Ma Gu is your master?

103
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:34,929
So, you're the martial uncle

104
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,720
my master had mentioned to me?

105
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,121
You were the one who stood idly by
when my master died,

106
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:41,840
right?

107
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,681
I've let your master down.

108
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,570
Jingtian.

109
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,520
I've let Ma Gu down!

110
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,720
Jingtian.

111
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,201
I've let her down...

112
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,681
This is the new prescription
I have invented.

113
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,921
That's great.

114
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:14,890
This is for you.

115
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,121
It's for me?

116
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,200
- But I never expected scheming people
- It looks great.

117
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,441
- to target her prescriptions.
- You're so nice to me.

118
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:23,809
They hired some thugs.

119
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,489
Shi Jingtian, come out!

120
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,570
Shi Jingtian, come out!

121
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,330
- Shi Jingtian!
- Shi Jingtian! Come out!

122
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,040
Come out!

123
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,530
- Don't open it.
- Open the door!

124
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,240
It's obvious that they're framing you!

125
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:32,970
Shi Jingtian!

126
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:34,729
- Shi. Open the door!
- Shi Jingtian, come out!

127
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,450
I'll go outside

128
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,289
and reason with them!

129
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,600
- Shi Jingtian, open the door!
- Hurry and come out!

130
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,650
Ma Gu, just ignore them.
They're upset right now.

131
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,330
If you go outside,

132
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,920
- you'll be at a disadvantage.
- Come out!

133
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,689
What about this?

134
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,410
Just let them be.

135
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,570
They'll run out of energy.

136
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:47,840
Wait for them to leave.

137
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,609
Shi, we can't let them be.

138
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,650
If they keep doing this,

139
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:52,809
you won't be able

140
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,321
to operate your herb store!

141
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,561
Ma Gu!

142
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:55,970
Come out!

143
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,840
Stop maligning him!

144
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,010
Come out if you're a man!

145
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:00,441
Why are you guys trying to frame him?

146
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,289
Who are you to him?

147
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,850
He sells spurious herbs!

148
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,450
My father died after taking it!

149
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,809
He's a murderer!

150
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

151
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,720
Do you believe
that I'll report this to the authorities

152
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,040
and have you guys arrested?

153
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Hurry and leave!

154
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,450
You're Shi Jingtian's accomplice.

155
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,480
Both of you are liars!

156
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,689
Return my father to me!

157
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,480
I'll kill you!

158
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,720
Ma Gu!

159
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,650
I!

160
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,640
Go to hell!

161
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,201
To hell with you!

162
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,890
Shi Jingtian, come out!

163
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,169
Open the door!

164
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,570
Shi Jingtian!

165
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:43,929
Come out!

166
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,801
- Shi, save me.
- Open the door!

167
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:51,890
Open the door!

168
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,441
Shi, open the door!

169
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:56,600
Save me!

170
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,361
Hurry and come out!

171
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,770
Darned wretch!

172
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,600
How dare you obstruct us?

173
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,400
Ma Gu...

174
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,330
Since then,

175
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:29,761
I was mentally distressed.

176
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,640
I had nightmares every night.

177
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,041
After that,

178
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,720
I went to Medicine King Valley.

179
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,290
I established this stone fort

180
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,120
with the money I made
from her prescriptions.

181
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:40,880
I spent a lot of money

182
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,249
to place a hit on the three thugs.

183
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,769
I turned them into wax corpses.

184
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,129
I want them to kneel and apologize

185
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,201
to Ma Gu for all eternity.

186
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,990
I even told my servants
to not close the door at night.

187
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,480
I instruct them to light candles
at night to welcome her spirit.

188
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,561
Paper dolls weren't real enough.

189
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,120
They couldn't express my regret
toward Ma Gu.

190
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:08,161
Therefore,

191
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,720
I bought real corpses
to worship the spirit of Ma Gu.

192
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,649
I make them atone for my sin

193
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,360
for eternity.

194
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,441
Whenever Mr. Jingtian

195
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,880
kneels in the hall every night,

196
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,810
I have to pretend to be Ma Gu
and knock on the door.

197
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:24,801
He can only close his eyes

198
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,480
and sleep

199
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,649
on that night

200
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,930
when the door

201
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:29,960
is opened.

202
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,441
You shameless man.

203
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,609
Master died because of you!

204
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,880
Even so, you're still
putting on an act like this!

205
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,080
You pretend to blame yourself
and act as if you're a devoted man.

206
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,210
You truly disgust me.

207
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,409
I've never seen

208
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,521
a man as shameless as you.

209
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,801
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,561
I'm sorry!

211
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,240
Sorry?

212
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:53,609
Do you think

213
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,769
that will neutralize the harm

214
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,521
you've done to her?

215
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,210
Can I kill you

216
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,161
if I say sorry to you?

217
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,769
If I can,

218
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,161
you better extend your neck
and let me chop it off.

219
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,129
If not,

220
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,489
what you said just now

221
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,649
was full of nonsense!

222
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,840
Miss Jiu.

223
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,120
If you keep this up,

224
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,489
I shall show you no mercy.

225
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,321
I've let Ma Gu down.

226
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:17,760
It's all my fault!

227
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,600
Jingtian!

228
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,690
Ma Gu, I'm sorry!

229
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,170
Ma Gu, where are you?

230
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:27,529
Ma Gu!

231
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,290
Mr. Jingtian!

232
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,889
- Don't kill me!
- Jingtian!

233
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,529
Mr. Jingtian!

234
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,889
Jingtian!

235
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,369
Ma Gu!

236
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,249
Mr. Jingtian!

237
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,009
Ma Gu!

238
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,489
Ma Gu!

239
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,561
Mr. Jingtian!

240
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,769
Ma Gu, where are you?

241
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,129
I'm begging you!

242
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,930
- Please don't kill me!
- Mr. Jingtian!

243
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,561
Ma Gu!

244
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,240
- Just kill me!
- Hurry and call for the witch doctor!

245
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:49,050
Jingtian, it's fine.

246
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm here for you.

247
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:52,930
Jingtian, it's fine.

248
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm here for you.

249
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,529
My senior is suffering from a relapse.

250
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,041
He needs to rest and recuperate.

251
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,960
The three of you shouldn't stay here.

252
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,720
You guys should head back first.

253
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,080
When Shi Jingtian's ailment
was acting up,

254
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,201
the Yin Sting Bug

255
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,840
ruptured and died.

256
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,170
Shi Jingtian

257
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:19,801
must be closely related

258
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,840
to the Soul Grass.

259
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,450
Is there any way we can obtain
another Yin Sting Bug?

260
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,210
I think

261
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,570
we can give it one more try.

262
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,450
Oh please.

263
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,970
It's a Yin Sting Bug.

264
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,921
It'll take at least
one year to create it.

265
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,889
Where have you guys been?

266
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,561
I couldn't find any of you.

267
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:47,729
Hurry up.

268
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,201
Let's check out the Shi Residence.
