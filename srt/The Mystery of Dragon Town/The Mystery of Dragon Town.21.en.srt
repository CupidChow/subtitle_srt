=Episode 21=

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,770
Just you wait.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,059
The Commanding Officer has already
arrived in the neighboring county.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,130
Liao Sheng has
finished the maps as well.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,520
We have to send the maps
to him as soon as possible.

17
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,289
I'll get out of the car here.

18
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,419
You have to send

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,529
Deputy Mayor Tian's body
back to the police station.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,059
I'll look for Master and Luoluo.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,929
Xiaojiu.

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,169
There's something

23
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,169
I need to tell you.

24
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,410
Deputy Mayor Tian's death was planned by

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,449
himself and I.

26
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,369
What do you mean?

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,330
Deputy Mayor Tian and I

28
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,490
staged an act.

29
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,649
Our goal is to join
the Baishan Chamber of Commerce

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,369
and lure out Black Snake.

31
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:50,818
But why did you kill him

32
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,089
if it was just an act?

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,899
Detective Yang,

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,098
I heard that you're investigating
Medicine King Valley.

35
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,529
You have to be careful.

36
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,259
I'm afraid the mastermind

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,938
is much more discreet
and stronger than we think.

38
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,419
In this town,

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,378
only the Chief Bailiff and Commissioner Li

40
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,690
have such influences.

41
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,490
The Higher Education Bureau,

42
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,859
are they one of them?

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,859
I'm not clear.

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,649
Maybe one of them is a member.

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,539
Maybe none of them is.

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,498
Detective Yang,

47
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,458
have you ever heard of
an organization called

48
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,290
Baishan Chamber of Commerce
in Dragon Town?

49
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,979
What does

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,898
this organization do?

51
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,298
Baishan Chamber of Commerce

52
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,259
is extraordinarily discreet and strong.

53
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,249
Their leader is called Black Snake.

54
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,539
He's directly related

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,659
to the strange cases

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,259
that had occurred in Dragon Town

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,419
lately.

58
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,498
They possess something

59
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:38,178
even more terrifying than opium.

60
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,338
For that,

61
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,770
they won't hesitate to kill.

62
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,730
So,

63
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:44,929
you also suspect

64
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,529
that such a commodity exists, huh?

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,010
Indeed.

66
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,298
In Dragon Town,

67
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,018
I've kept my defenses up the whole time.

68
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,458
Those who wanted to take opium

69
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,939
could only do so in secret.

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,010
Thus, I became a thorn in their flesh.

71
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:58,738
Detective Yang,

72
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,659
if you find any leads,

73
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,539
during crucial moments,

74
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,490
I'm willing
to sacrifice my life to assist you.

75
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:04,498
I'll go after them.

76
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,490
Keep an eye on them.

77
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,929
Initially, I was able
to catch up to him.

78
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,770
But someone abducted him.

79
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,689
It was Deputy Mayor's car.

80
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,330
Let's work together
to root out this Black Snake.

81
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,409
We must protect Dragon Town
from these drugs.

82
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,699
Did they tell you

83
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,969
to frame me for the opium deals

84
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,610
and kick me out of Dragon Town?

85
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,249
No.

86
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,610
That's my idea.

87
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:31,170
That's not enough.

88
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,689
Such a pledge of loyalty

89
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,369
isn't sincere enough.

90
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,809
It's not enough to convince them.

91
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,730
Before this, I told you

92
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,040
that I was willing to sacrifice
my life to assist you.

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,219
It's not because

94
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,939
I'll be removed from my position.

95
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,379
It's because

96
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,178
I'm terminally ill.

97
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,219
There's no cure.

98
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,290
Deputy Mayor Tian?

99
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:50,969
Spare your breath.

100
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,689
Just follow my instructions.

101
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:54,738
If I can

102
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,050
do some good for the people here,

103
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,730
I suppose

104
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,490
I've led a worthy life.

105
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,010
Detective Yang,

106
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,778
behind me is the town I've protected.

107
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:14,139
This might be the best place
of respite for me.

108
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,290
Shoot me.

109
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,930
Detective Yang,

110
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,899
if you don't do it,

111
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,419
all of my efforts

112
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,729
will go down the drain.

113
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,729
Detective Yang,

114
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,779
as the mayor of Dragon Town
all these years,

115
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,810
I think I've contributed
to the well-being

116
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,729
of the people of Dragon Town.

117
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,339
I believe that you can definitely

118
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,609
identify the mastermind.

119
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,849
Detective Yang,

120
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,169
for the sake of
the people of Dragon Town,

121
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,489
I have no complaints
even if I have to die here.

122
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,570
Do it.

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,849
Do it!

124
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,289
Don't worry.

125
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,930
Deputy Mayor Tian's death

126
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,330
won't be in vain.

127
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,049
(A blood pack?)

128
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,010
(Yang Ziqi, you're something else.)

129
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,618
(So, this was what you meant)

130
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,210
(by staging an act, huh?)

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,350
(Baishan Chamber of Commerce)

132
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,058
Welcome to Baishan Chamber of Commerce,

133
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,130
Detective Yang.

134
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,529
Thank you, President.

135
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,298
I'm not the president.

136
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,698
Everything here,

137
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,219
all of the arrangements,

138
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,138
including all of our encounters,

139
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,409
were carried out
under the president's instructions.

140
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,609
Me?

141
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:18,370
I'm just a nobody.

142
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,890
You're not the president?

143
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:21,969
If so...

144
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,729
Did you see the snake head logo
on all of these items?

145
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,250
That's our president.

146
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,210
Are you guys kidding me?

147
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,579
I've already done my part.

148
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,019
I even murdered my friend.

149
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,738
Is that not sincere enough?

150
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,560
Do you guys want
to collaborate with me or not?

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,729
Who exactly is Black Snake?

152
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,579
Detective Yang,

153
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,049
don't be impatient.

154
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:47,529
Now, we're a family.

155
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,770
Just wait for me
at the police station tonight.

156
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,138
By then,

157
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,690
you'll find out

158
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,770
who Black Snake is.

159
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:34,889
Don't worry. I'll keep my promise.

160
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,699
As long as you guys

161
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,889
hand Wang Luoluo's body to me,

162
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,939
I'll make sure to maintain

163
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,089
the yield of Soul Grass
in Medicine King Valley.

164
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,120
The girl who participated
in the funeral rites is dead.

165
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,939
Have you guys detected

166
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,009
any movements from Detective Yang?

167
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:51,930
Got it.

168
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,889
It's all of your fault.

169
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:02,699
Jingtian wouldn't die

170
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,489
had you guys not come here
in the first place.

171
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,330
You guys ruined
Medicine King Valley as well.

172
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,410
I won't let you die that easily!

173
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,249
I won't let you off that easily!

174
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,778
I'll turn all of you

175
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,570
into my wax figures.

176
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,530
Only then will I be appeased.

177
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,729
(Luoluo, we're lucky
to have you around.)

178
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,410
It looks pretty good.

179
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,450
Keep it with you.

180
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,810
This is the same as the Yin Sting Bug.

181
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,138
If it's vibrating,

182
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:46,609
doesn't that mean I'll die?

183
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,138
The bottle contains

184
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:49,378
a Mother-Child Odor Bug.

185
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,859
The mother bug I have
can track down the scent of the child bug.

186
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,530
This way, I can track you down.

187
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,969
Are there any more impressive ones?

188
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,650
Where's Xiaojiu?

189
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:36,729
Hurry and rescue Xiaojiu!

190
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,249
What happened to her?

191
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,579
Hurry.

192
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,240
You must rescue her.

193
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,139
She was sent away
from the Fuwen Secret Estate.

194
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,440
It was from the two-story building across
from Liang's Tailor Shop that they set off.

195
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,489
Yang Ziqi.

196
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:48,050
Xiaojiu trusted you, you know?

197
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,018
If anything happens to her,

198
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,530
you'll join her in the underworld!

199
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,609
How did you manage to come in?

200
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,219
You scum.

201
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,489
Where's Xiaojiu?

202
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,410
Did she die because of you?

203
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,089
Luoluo, listen to me.

204
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,738
She swore loyalty to you, you know?

205
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:23,979
Don't think that you can survive

206
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,249
if anything happens to her!

207
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,898
You have to blame her
for being too stubborn.

208
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,930
If you come again,
I'll finish you off as well.

209
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:19,219
(This is bad.)

210
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,179
(Old man,)

211
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,059
(Shi Youruo might kill me this time.)

212
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,219
(Yang Ziqi,)

213
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,658
(it's all thanks to your stupid idea.)

214
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,249
(I'll never let you off!)

215
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,810
I knew you would come to my rescue.

216
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,000
It's all thanks to
the treasure you gave me.

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,538
All of bugs were terrified of it.
They didn't dare to approach me.

218
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,769
They weren't terrified of it. They detest it.

219
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,059
To the bugs, the odor of

220
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,690
the Mother-Child Odor Bug

221
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:57,658
is just like

222
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:58,699
your fart.

223
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,170
It's your fart.

224
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,330
Let's go.

225
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,609
Ms. Youruo.

226
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,290
Long time no see.

227
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,299
Do you still remember us?

228
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,690
It's you two?

229
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,530
Tell the people who are
monitoring Yang Ziqi to withdraw.

230
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,330
(Xiaojiu,)

231
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,330
(please be safe.)

233
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,459
