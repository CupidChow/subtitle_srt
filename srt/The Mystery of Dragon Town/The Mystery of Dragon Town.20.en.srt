=Episode 20=

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,919
Mister.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,959
Have you ever come across

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,590
this pattern?

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,791
No.

17
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,720
Thank you, mister.

18
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:48,959
Have you ever seen this pattern?

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,990
No.

20
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,440
It's indeed our craftsmanship.

21
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,559
The customer asked for a similar one.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,440
That's great!

23
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,080
Mister,

24
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:56,959
do you remember

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,791
who asked for this pattern?

26
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,071
It's our customers' privacy.

27
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,711
There's no way I'm telling you.

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,590
I can pay you.

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,599
And I swear.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,110
I will never tell a soul.

31
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:10,360
Er Niu,

32
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,310
see this lady out.

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
Please consider my offer, mister.

34
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:14,399
Leave.

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,271
Go ahead.

36
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,080
You came to the right man.

37
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,110
I'm in charge
of delivering Master Fu Wen's goods.

38
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,959
The one at the end of Puxi Road

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,991
is his residence.

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
There's a pagoda tree in front of it.

41
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,931
(Yutang House, 15. Yutang House, 07)

42
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,731
(Entrance Ticket)

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,471
(I knew it.)

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,430
(Fu Wen and Sui Wen
are the same person.)

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,911
Yang Ziqi!

46
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:35,950
I found it!

47
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,550
I found the clue!

48
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,990
Take a break first.

49
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,110
I found Sui Wen's address.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,160
There's a trace
of his presence in there.

51
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,071
As long as we lie in wait in advance,
we'll definitely catch him. Let's go!

52
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,870
Come.

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,240
Well,

54
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,400
you've been everywhere

55
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:07,670
looking for clues.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,631
It must have been tiring.

57
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,390
That's nothing.

58
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,079
I just don't want to let
the suspect escape just like that.

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,071
Let's go!

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,950
What's going on?

61
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,791
Yang Ziqi?

62
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,430
You're up.

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,231
What are you doing?

64
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,599
I'm aware of how important
Yu Shuang's body is to you.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,150
So I'll help you locate it.

66
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,071
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,471
I've underestimated you.

68
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:26,719
I never expected

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,591
a petite undertaker like you

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,870
would possess such a strong willpower.

71
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,791
You managed to chase after me
all the way here.

72
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,630
I look forward to working with you,

73
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,190
Detective Yang.

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,199
Likewise.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,240
Yang Ziqi!

76
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,110
Is this how you bring justice
to the people and root out evil for them?

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,759
Are you even human?

78
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,560
If I had known,

79
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,680
I would've killed you
and fed dogs with your body.

80
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,600
No.

81
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:56,360
I bet

82
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:57,791
dogs would despise your body!

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,279
Yu Shuang's body

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,630
is with him.

85
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,351
And he'll return it to you.

86
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,031
That ignorant Yu Shuang.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,310
She took what shouldn't have taken.

88
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,480
Tell Black Snake

89
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,920
that I'll leave Dragon Town.

90
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,831
And I'll take this secret to the grave.

91
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:20,759
From the moment you stole it,

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,870
you're already dead.

93
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:26,951
Aren't you going to hand it over?

94
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,639
It's not with me.

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,079
There's no way you're getting it.

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,750
If I handed it over, I'd be killed.

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Well...

98
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:35,071
I might live if I don't hand it over.

99
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,591
I know it's with He Shanshan.

100
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,430
From the moment
he thought of stealing it,

101
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,630
his fate had been decided.

102
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,791
He thought he could threatened
Baishan Chamber of Commerce with that.

103
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:53,630
He had it pawned

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,911
before the transfer.

105
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,791
He had planned every step well.

106
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:01,271
But he was wrong
about Black Snake's tolerance.

107
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,560
Black Snake

108
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,231
would never put himself

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,510
into a risky situation.

110
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,750
Master Meng.

111
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,120
For the sake of me
being a long-time patron

112
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,190
of the theatre,

113
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:16,110
please help me plead
with this gentleman.

114
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:17,750
The document

115
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,711
you are looking for

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
is no longer with me.

117
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:23,591
He Shanshan took it.

118
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,351
That means

119
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:35,870
you saw what was written on it, right?

120
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,120
No, no.

121
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,240
Sir, Master Meng.

122
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:42,471
Seriously, I didn't see anything.
I didn't see anything at all!

123
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,791
So

124
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,031
you're not going to hand it over,

125
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,351
huh?

126
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,190
Please don't kill me.

127
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,880
If I die, this secret will be known
all over Dragon Town

128
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,399
in one single day.

129
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,151
I'm a journalist.

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,190
You will regret it.

131
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:26,151
Whether it was Black Wuchang
killing He Shanshan,

132
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,831
or Yuan Bin's ghost encounter,

133
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,870
or Meng Wei's murder case,

134
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:36,031
it was all just a scheme I devised
using ghosts and spirits.

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,630
This scheme

136
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,159
could only be completed
by an undertaker shunned by common folk

137
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,271
as a misfortune harbinger.

138
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,670
At first, I planned
to hire Master Jiu for it.

139
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,759
But

140
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,310
by pure accident,

141
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:51,670
you ended up getting involved instead.

142
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,190
My little brother died in the city.

143
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,639
I'd like Master Jiu to go there
and bring his body back home

144
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,759
for a funeral.

145
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,151
That way, he can rest in peace.

146
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,000
How come it's not Master Jiu?

147
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,310
Here's some wedding money.

148
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,711
Please accept it.

149
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,040
We've all underestimated you.

150
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,320
All this could have ended with
the little ghost bride's incident.

151
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,800
Yet, I never thought
you would throw Dragon Town into chaos

152
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:17,000
over the missing Yu Shuang.

153
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:19,670
You almost ruined
our year-long business.

154
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,430
Well,

155
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:24,310
there were even times
when you almost got me.

156
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,550
Luckily,

157
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,591
I had your most trustworthy Yang Ziqi
to help me.

158
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,150
And I managed to escape every time.

159
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,231
I see.

160
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,831
You purposely let him go

161
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,030
back in the theater.

162
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,120
Regarding your opium business,

163
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,159
I have an idea

164
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,471
to make it more profitable.

165
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,790
Let's work together.

166
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,870
What do you think?

167
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,790
Why should I trust you?

168
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,071
Once I've found your hideout,

169
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,990
would it be more convincing

170
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,231
with that intel as my bargaining chip?

171
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:11,990
Yang Ziqi!

172
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,270
This offer

173
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,831
is my gesture of sincerity.

174
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,030
Yang Ziqi.

175
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,951
What you did in the street,

176
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:35,191
that was on purpose, right?

177
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
You all chased after me
all the way to Medicine King Valley.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,639
That almost ruined
my source of business.

179
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,679
Is that your so-called plan?

180
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,030
If we want to work together,

181
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,990
naturally,
the more bargaining chips, the better.

182
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,150
Besides,

183
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,960
Xiao Jiu and her friend have figured out

184
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,480
the secret

185
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,671
of Medicine King Valley.

186
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,200
Even if I hadn't come,

187
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,630
other officers would have.

188
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,279
The more people show up,

189
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,431
the slimmer your chance
of getting away with it.

190
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,711
I only brought a few people with me.

191
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:06,951
Well,

192
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:08,759
aren't I sincere enough?

193
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,750
Step back!

194
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,351
You lured Xiao Jiu and me away.

195
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,110
The real shipment

196
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:18,790
containing the Soul Grass

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,951
must have been moved by your men, no?

198
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,270
You're smart.

199
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,231
That makes you
a solid choice for a business partner.

200
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:35,919
I meant it when I expressed my wish
to join your business.

201
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,519
With my position as a police officer,

202
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,919
this business will only go further.

203
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,191
The bigger the pie,

204
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,120
the more

205
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:44,551
everyone gets to share.

206
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,750
Right?

207
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:49,671
You were promoted step by step
by the Commanding Officer.

208
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,551
Why did you betray him?

209
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,030
These days,

210
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,671
who in their right mind
would say no to money?

211
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:00,840
All this time,

212
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,200
I've done all the work.

213
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:04,240
Yet, the Commanding Officer
has had all the credits.

214
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,200
Well,

215
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,551
as time goes by,

216
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,759
anyone

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,711
would have had enough of it.

218
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't you hate

219
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,471
Deputy Mayor Tian?

220
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:20,150
I can do you another favor.

221
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,630
So

222
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,790
Deputy Mayor wasn't the president
of Baishan Chamber of Commerce.

223
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,640
In fact, you're
from the Baishan Chamber of Commerce.

224
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,591
You framed him for everything!

225
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,320
What a flawless plan

226
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:41,231
you've got there.

227
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,150
And you even helped me
get rid of my major threat.

228
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,951
You lied to me.

229
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,471
Could it be

230
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,071
all this

231
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,951
has been nothing but an act?

232
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,311
You've never liked me?

233
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,231
We're living in a tumultuous time.

234
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,471
Anyone would betray you.

235
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,551
But money would never do so.

236
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,790
Cooperate with us.

237
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,519
Say what you should say.

238
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,231
And don't say what you shouldn't say.

239
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,351
Keep quiet when necessary.

240
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,240
You had our theater shut down

241
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,390
with the excuse
of Yu Shuang coming back to life.

242
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,471
Was that your plan too,

243
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,071
Detective Yang?

244
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,790
Seizing the opium

245
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,039
was just a tactic

246
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,919
to gain leverage in our negotiations.

247
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,880
Yang Ziqi. I'll deal with you

248
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,000
with a thousand times more effort
than I ever spent looking for corpses.

249
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,439
Mark my words!

250
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,431
- I will do that even if it costs my life!
- Mark my words!

251
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,071
What she said has served as a reminder.

252
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,240
Detective Yang.

253
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,880
Show me your final bit of sincerity.

254
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:51,880
As long as

255
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,910
you kill her with your own hands,

256
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,311
I'll believe you completely.

257
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,150
Well?

258
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
To accomplish great things,

259
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,270
one must not be swayed by emotions.

260
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,191
Detective Yang,

261
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,951
please.

262
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,519
Back when you intercepted

263
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,390
our opium transport,

264
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,630
you destroyed quite a few bodies.

265
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,240
She's an undertaker
who deals with the dead every day.

266
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:59,831
Now that she's dead,

267
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,360
we might as well hollow her out

268
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,870
and use her body to smuggle goods.

269
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,399
Don't you find such a twist

270
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,790
interesting?

271
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:26,572
Just you wait.
