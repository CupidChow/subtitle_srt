"Cases Must Solve," huh?
[*Cases Must Be Solved]

24
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,799
Right.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,631
A message from you
is pretty unforgettable.

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,639
She's up...

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,440
She's up...

28
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,670
She's risen from the dead!

29
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:12,990
Go!

30
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,150
Detective Yang!

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,270
Look!

32
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,270
He Shanshan...

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,670
Luoluo...

34
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,550
Xiaojiu, where did you go?

35
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,511
Luoluo, what are you doing here?

36
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,720
All right.

37
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,430
Get the body cleaned up now.

38
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,471
It's over.

39
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,591
Send him to the hospital.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,479
Take He Shanshan's body

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,791
to the morgue.

42
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,311
What's wrong with you?

43
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,079
Are you all right?

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,919
Are you all right?

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,990
Where did you go?

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,430
This is...

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
(Medicine Maiden of Miaojiang)
Let me introduce you. This is my best friend,

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,200
(Wang Luoluo)
the top medicine maiden of Miaojiang,

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,710
Wang Luoluo.

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,390
Master Jiu said you didn't come back
all night, so he sent me to the station.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,780
The Yin Sting Bug
must have smelled something.

52
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,351
It crawled into the female corpse.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,231
That commotion was caused by it.

54
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:16,071
I remember that bug is really rare.

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Which means inside this corpse

56
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,510
must be something unusual.

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,550
Move aside!

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,310
Deputy Mayor, sorry for the delay.

59
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,959
(Tian Zhen, Deputy Mayor)

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,190
Director,

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,000
your place here is really

62
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,630
full of hidden talents.

63
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,319
Deputy Mayor.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
This young woman

65
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,591
not from our police station.

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,190
Deputy Mayor.

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,399
You were right.

68
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,319
You're amazing!

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,000
He's the tiger.

70
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,070
He's the dragon!

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,680
Let me introduce you.

72
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:57,319
This is Detective Yang,
sent by the Commanding Officer.

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,430
Yang Ziqi.

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,670
Deputy Mayor.

75
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,711
So you're Detective Yang.

76
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,630
I've heard so much about you.

77
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,519
When will the Commanding Officer arrive?

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,519
I, Tian,

79
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,880
have been waiting eagerly.

80
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,839
I even planned

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,880
a banquet for him
at Longwei Restaurant to welcome him.

82
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,160
The Commanding Officer
still has official matters to handle.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
So I came ahead

84
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:18,831
to get a grasp on the situation.

85
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,110
Liu told me that He Shanshan...

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,510
She's a bit terrifying.

87
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:29,391
How's the investigation going?

88
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,911
We can't draw conclusions just yet.

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,759
The suspect in Sui'an Village,
Old Wu, committed suicide.

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,920
As for his previous statements,

91
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:39,159
I need to verify them further
before making a judgment.

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,759
But the station has already sent people

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,070
to follow up in the village.

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,719
I'll get to the bottom of this case.

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,519
Deputy Mayor, there's no need to worry.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,791
Good.

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
Detective Yang,

98
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,639
you have my full support.

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,550
Investigate.

100
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,959
Investigate.

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,951
Investigate!

102
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:01,319
It hasn't even been half an hour,

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,040
and the story
about He Shanshan's corpse rising

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,591
is already all over town.

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Her father, He Yunkui,

106
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,591
already came to find me.

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,351
What is going on here?

108
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:11,199
Commissioner Li,

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,159
it seems like a bug was the culprit.

110
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,831
But the situation
has already been dealt with.

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,159
Director Wu. Director-General Ma
from the provincial office

112
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,911
thinks very highly of you.

113
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,220
Now that a case like this
has happened in Dragon Town,

114
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,720
(Li Da, Political Commissioner)
if it Director-General Ma finds out,

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
he will definitely
hold someone accountable.

116
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,600
Originally, I could have put
in a good word for you

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,870
in front of Director-General Ma.

118
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,639
But if this case affects

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,951
his opinion of the police station...

120
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,271
Director Wu,

121
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,391
there'll be nothing
I can do to help you.

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,360
No...

123
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,351
Commissioner Li,

124
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,279
please still speak well of me.

125
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,159
Don't worry.

126
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,271
I'll make sure this matter
is handled quickly and properly.

127
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,791
All right.

128
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,550
Just resolve it properly,

129
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,110
and don't let it blow up any further.

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,430
Understood.

131
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,591
Where's the Deputy Mayor?

132
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,510
He already left.

133
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,870
He asked us

134
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,031
to solve the case quickly.

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,319
How soon can you crack the case?

136
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,310
Seven days.

137
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,719
This is police business.

138
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
What does it have to do
with a damn funeral worker like you?

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,480
Jumping around like that like a monkey!

140
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,351
You...

141
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,951
Director.

142
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,959
She is now...

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,351
She's my

144
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:22,711
informant.

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,670
She went with me
to Sui'an Village yesterday.

146
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,279
Then I'll give you seven days.

147
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,550
If you still can't solve
the case by then,

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,990
prepare to be held accountable.

149
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,800
What's it got to do with you?

150
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,510
Who asked you to speak for me?

151
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,319
How does it not concern me?

152
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,440
Yu Shuang's body
still hasn't been found.

153
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,639
She's clearly connected to He Shanshan.

154
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,231
Of course it concerns me.

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,430
Liu.

156
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,591
Head to He Shanshan's house now.

157
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,151
Keep her father calm.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,140
Me?

159
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:04,691
(Qimen Dunjia)

160
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,260
(Household Registration Certificate:
Wang Chuanfu)

161
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,371
(Household Registration Certificate:
Yu Shuang)

162
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
Yang Ziqi.

163
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,031
I want...

164
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,079
How...

165
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,310
How did you know I was here?

166
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,391
I...

167
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,560
Liu told me.

168
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:32,471
I gave him a bottle of liquor,
he told me everything.

169
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,510
Damn that Liu.

170
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,910
You light candles

171
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,551
just to take a bath?

172
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,110
That's called aromatherapy.

173
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,831
Atmosphere.

174
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:45,711
I should wave some garlic at your head.

175
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,591
I get it.

176
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,071
Get what?

177
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,870
It's just spring palace art, right?

178
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:01,960
You're a man.

179
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,320
Looking at erotic paintings,

180
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,030
it's understandable.

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,071
When you came in just now,

182
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,351
what were you about to say?

183
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,759
I want to know,

184
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,110
where did I collect Yu Shuang's body?

185
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,639
Lotus Residence, East City.

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,030
3 Huaixi Road.

187
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,360
That's the place
where I delivered Yu Shuang's body.

188
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,191
Yes.

189
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,439
I found the owner of the house.

190
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,630
Let's go take a look.

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,790
See if that person is the same one
who opened the door for you that night.

192
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:32,960
- Come on.
- Cheers!

193
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,260
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bottoms up!

194
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,591
Don't brag now.

195
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,840
None of you can beat my teeth.

196
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,591
See this plate of peanuts?

197
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:46,720
I can shove the whole thing in my mouth
and chew it all down.

198
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:48,080
You're bluffing, Sixth Brother.

199
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:48,759
You're full of it.

200
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,711
You don't believe me?

201
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Slow down.

202
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,351
You're really doing it?

203
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,720
I told you to investigate,

204
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,150
and this is how you do it?

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,870
If I catch you slacking off again,

206
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,510
don't blame me for being harsh.

207
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,831
(Property Transaction Record)
This deed, is it real?

208
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,480
Do you know

209
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:30,080
(Yuan Bin)

210
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:31,191
this person?

211
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,071
Cat got your tongue?

212
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,671
Drank yourself stupid?

213
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,390
Speak.

214
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,870
Speak!

215
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm really sorry.

217
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,951
I'm so sorry!

218
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,671
Don't move.

219
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,639
You have one hour

220
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,231
to find out where Yuan Bin is.

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,630
How are we supposed
to do that in an hour?

222
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,870
Detective Yang.

223
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,990
I know where Yuan Bin is.

224
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:15,439
(Dragon Town Garrison Office)

225
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,110
We'll go find him at the brothel.

226
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,951
You go wait at Yuan Bin's house.

227
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:20,399
No matter what happens tonight,

228
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,831
we must find him.

229
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,320
Don't worry, Detective Yang.

230
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,150
We'll get the job done this time.

231
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,240
You're sure this Yuan Bin,

232
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,390
Master Yuan

233
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,671
was the butler
who opened the door that night?

234
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,591
No doubt.

235
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,110
Broad face.

236
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
Upturned eyes.

237
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,039
Hooked nose.

238
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,431
Half a head shorter than you.

239
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,591
That's him.

240
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,431
If we find him,

241
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,750
we'll know the truth

242
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:50,231
about why Yu Shuang
and He Shanshan died.

243
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,471
Once we know that,

244
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,000
the whole case

245
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:54,311
will become clear.

246
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,159
You guess

247
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,831
what did He Shanshan say

248
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,360
to Wu Qingzhi

249
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:00,679
before she died?

250
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,639
I guess

251
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,360
that sentence

252
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,951
was the real reason
for He Shanshan's death.

253
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,671
Been eating a lot of brains lately, huh?

254
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:11,840
Detective Yang.

255
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:14,200
If you've got nothing decent
to say, shut your mouth.

256
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,279
Careful, or next time Liu

257
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,910
might feed you peanuts mouth to mouth.

258
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,790
Xiaojiu.

259
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,351
Was there anything strange
about Yu Shuang's body?

260
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:33,110
Her face was pale as paper.

261
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,671
Eyes blood red.

262
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,399
That woman who asked you
to perform the funeral rites.

263
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,831
Do you remember anything about her?

264
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,191
I just remember
she looked really strange.

265
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:45,559
She clearly had

266
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,080
two eyes, one nose, and a mouth,

267
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,551
but she looked incredibly creepy.

268
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,840
Honestly,

269
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,390
she did look like a ghost.

270
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,750
I don't believe in that nonsense.

271
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,960
We're about
to find Yuan Bin any minute now.

272
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,000
Once we get him,

273
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,919
we can root out the rest of them too.

274
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,600
I said she looks like a ghost.

275
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,551
I didn't say she is one.

276
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,000
Sir.

277
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:11,120
We really don't have the person
you're looking for here.

278
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,270
You're lying.

279
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:15,390
I swear, he's not here.

280
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,480
We're on a tight schedule.

281
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,159
We could only sketch a rough portrait.

282
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,639
It's crude at best,

283
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,270
nothing like a photo.

284
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,480
Most people
would just say they can't tell

285
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,480
or they don't know.

286
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,551
But you said he's not here.

287
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,270
That means you've seen him.

288
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,431
And

289
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:34,671
you know him.

290
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,720
He's one of our top guests here
at Fuchun Courtyard,

291
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,870
Master Yuan.

292
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
He always books the second-floor room,

293
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,799
the Liuying Pavilion.

294
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,671
Is he still in there now?

295
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:52,351
He should be.

296
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,320
Why don't you two go check?

297
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:59,171
(Fuchun Courtyard)

298
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,559
Who would've thought

299
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,519
you're actually

300
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,591
a bit smarter than those cops

301
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,591
at the station.

302
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,071
Oh, listen to you.

303
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,790
What is it?

304
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,591
Nothing.

305
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,351
He's not here.

306
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,471
Search the room.

307
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,790
We've got him cornered.

308
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,711
He can't escape.

309
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,679
What a hassle.

310
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,831
Exactly.

311
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,110
