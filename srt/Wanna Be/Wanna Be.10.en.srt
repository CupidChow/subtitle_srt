You've thought this through.

193
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,300
I would do the same.

194
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,100
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

195
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
Thank you for your understanding.

196
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,100
Thank you too
for giving the new people a chance.

197
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,460
I'll take care of the rest.

198
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,860
I promise to have the best male lead

199
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,300
with you in the least possible time.

200
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,140
Yijing,

201
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,580
what are you doing here?
Go back home and rest.

202
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,500
Aren't you tired
from filming all morning?

203
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,460
You go home. See you tomorrow.

204
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,260
Wait, Ms. Ling's seeing someone
in her office.

205
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,500
I know.

206
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,620
You're not seeing her?

207
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,300
Then...

208
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,540
She's actually avoiding you?

209
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,060
Don't tell me she's up to something
behind your back again.

210
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,020
Your posture is wrong.

211
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,100
You're only building bulk this way.

212
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,180
You won't get defined muscles.

213
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,820
I suggest you get a personal trainer.

214
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,540
Like me.

215
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,420
I'll tailor a one-on-one plan for you.
What do you think?

216
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,460
You?

217
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,020
For free?

218
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,180
That's a funny way to ask.

219
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
Given how close we are,

220
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,660
I'll give you a discount.

221
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,940
Forget it.

222
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,860
I'd just watch workout tutorials.

223
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
They don't cost anything.

224
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,620
Those won't work.

225
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,420
Workouts only work when you pay.

226
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,260
How about I teach
you martial arts instead?

227
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,940
It helps with weight loss,
body shaping, and self-defense.

228
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,020
I can give you a special group rate
of 300 yuan per hour.

229
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,940
Leave me alone.

230
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,620
So everyone's here.

231
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,380
- Ms. Han.
- Ms. Han.

232
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,860
Fan will be here soon.

233
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,340
He's busy with the store
in the mornings.

234
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,620
He usually comes after midday.

235
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,900
But he's the last to leave.

236
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,780
It's fine.

237
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,620
I just haven't seen you much
since the training camp.

238
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,900
So I thought I'd drop by to check on you

239
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,300
and treat you to a meal.

240
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,460
Personally.

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,100
There's no need for that.

242
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,060
Didn't you say I should be approachable?

243
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,460
Is it inconvenient?

244
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,820
- No, not at all.
- Of course not.

245
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,940
We're definitely going
for Ms. Han's treat.

246
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,380
I should go too.

247
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,460
It's about lunchtime.

248
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,580
Here he comes.

249
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,020
Fan.

250
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,820
Just in time.

251
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
Ms. Han is treating all of us to lunch.

252
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,100
Now?

253
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,780
Shubo will send you the location.

254
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,580
See you in a bit.

255
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Um, I'll pass.

256
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,540
I just ate.

257
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,620
Join us.

258
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,260
It's a rare chance.

259
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,140
You can stay and train extra,

260
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,260
to make up for this morning.

261
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,260
No.

262
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,900
I invited all the new recruits.

263
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,940
No one can be left out.

264
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,300
See you there then.

265
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,020
What are we waiting for?

266
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,340
Why don't we start?

267
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,700
I'm starving.

268
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,900
Eat then.

269
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,820
Here.

270
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,540
I'll toast to you all

271
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,100
with tea.

272
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,580
Wishing you a smooth debut.

273
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,060
- Thank you, Ms. Han.
- Thank you, Ms. Han.

274
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,100
Ms. Han.

275
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,780
Actually, we should be
the ones to toast you.

276
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,180
You're our coach

277
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,820
and our role model.

278
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,180
And your friend.

279
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,060
That's a bit too much.

280
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,500
I may not seem very approachable,

281
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,260
and the gossip about me
isn't exactly flattering,

282
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,060
but since we're gathered here today,

283
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,100
we're family from now on.

284
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,900
If you have any questions,

285
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
feel free to come to me.

286
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,060
I will be fair and help you

287
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,980
with all I know.

288
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,340
- Thank you, Ms. Han.
- Thank you, Ms. Han.

289
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,820
Anything wrong, Jia?

290
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,140
No.

291
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,340
It's truly an honor

292
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,660
to be one of yours.

293
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm flattered.

294
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,860
The reason I invited you today

295
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,900
is to clarify things openly

296
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,540
to prevent any misunderstandings

297
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,860
going forward.

298
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,540
Personally,

299
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,780
everything I do is for ACME

300
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,300
and I won't let personal interests
interfere.

301
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,260
And my intentions

302
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,300
towards you are completely honorable.

303
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,260
Ms. Han is just funny.

304
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,220
How could that happen?

305
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,380
Unless they lose their minds.

306
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,340
Ms. Han,

307
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,300
we're not three-year-olds.

308
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,140
Who would mistake a meal for a date?

309
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
People like that

310
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
are just delusional.

311
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,220
Or shameless.

312
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,100
With too much confidence.

313
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,300
Don't worry, Ms. Han.

314
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,580
We're not that kind of people.

315
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,700
Let's eat.

316
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,940
You'll have to get back to training.

317
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,780
Of course.

318
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,500
What's wrong?

319
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,020
Anyone chasing you?

320
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,980
Ms. Han,

321
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,180
can I ask you a question?

322
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,540
What can we do to endorse
Rachel's new products?

323
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
This is strange.

324
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,460
Yijing never treats anyone to a meal.

325
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,260
Why did she suddenly decide
to treat the rookies today?

326
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,180
Everything has been strange lately.

327
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,780
Ever since Jia Fan joined,

328
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,540
everything's been a mess.

329
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,500
He's like a virus.

330
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,060
He's affected Yijing and Ms. Ling.

331
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,540
Next, it'll be Xing Mo, You Ning,

332
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,820
and even you and me.

333
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,580
We'll all get caught up in his mess.

334
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,660
By the way,

335
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,300
I told you

336
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,460
he and I are completely incompatible.

337
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,060
Every time I see him,
something bad happens.

338
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,500
And now look.

339
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,660
He's forced his way in.

340
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,300
You can't even escape now.

341
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,460
Check your phone.

342
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,220
Why so sudden?

343
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Please submit
a two-minute vlog of yourself

344
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,260
by 10 AM tomorrow.

345
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,180
All vlogs will be uploaded
to the company's website.

346
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,780
The new male lead for Rachel

347
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,060
will be selected based on likes,
comments, and other feedback.

348
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,260
They will also have the chance

349
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,540
to endorse
their latest men's collection.

350
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,220
I thought Mo was selected for that.

351
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,700
I told you.

352
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
It's Mo's turn to be affected.

353
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,180
Does this mean

354
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
we have a chance too?

355
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,340
Whether it works for us
depends on how we do it.

356
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Let's go and bring the new people over.

357
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,580
We're leaving, Ms. Han.

358
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,340
See you next time.

359
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,220
Bye-bye, Ms. Han.

360
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,620
See you later.

361
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,220
Jia Fan.

362
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,260
You heard what I said, right?

363
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,980
Which part?

364
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,380
You said a lot of things.

365
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,140
I treat everyone fairly.

366
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,700
So no need to avoid me anymore.

367
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,900
I'm not.

368
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm just keeping my distance.

369
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,980
Why?

370
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,500
Could it be...?

371
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,060
The POS printer isn't working.

372
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,300
Why are you still here?

373
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,300
You can go.

374
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,740
I thought I should drive you back.

375
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,500
It's okay.

376
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,380
Go.

377
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,060
All right.

378
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,980
Could it be what?

379
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,060
Go on.

380
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,740
Could it be
that you're hiding something,

381
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
such as your feelings for me?

382
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,460
What are you doing?

383
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,460
Delete the photos.

384
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,500
We were just passing by

385
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,500
and couldn't help
when we saw Han Yijing.

386
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,780
But you can't take pictures
without permission.

387
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,540
Did you ask first?

388
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,500
Sorry,

389
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,660
he was just looking out for me.

390
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,660
After all,

391
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,100
the angles might not be good.

392
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,420
Then...

393
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,100
can we take a picture with you?

394
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,220
Of course.

395
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,740
Thank you! Come on.

396
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,580
Thank you, Yijing.

397
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,420
Let's go.

398
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,100
I heard none of you

399
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,780
passed the physical fitness test
yesterday.

400
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,700
As your mentor,
I take full responsibility.

401
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,060
So I've decided to give you

402
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,820
a special session.

403
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,980
Today...

404
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,860
But we need to go back
to film our vlogs tonight.

405
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm worried...

406
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,540
You haven't even mastered the basics

407
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,420
and you want to be the male lead?

408
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,100
Even if you get chosen,
you'll be replaced.

409
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,140
More importantly,
you'll embarrass the company.

410
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,580
What are you waiting for?

411
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,940
Get started!

412
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,380
Open your shoulders.

413
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,980
Feet together.

414
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,300
Tighten up. Don't shake.

415
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,180
Wait, your hip

416
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,540
is tilting to the next room.

417
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,220
Stretch your neck, longer!

418
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,020
Push upwards toward the ceiling!

419
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,100
I don't get it.

420
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,980
What does Ms. Ling see in you?

421
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,900
I wonder too.

422
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,300
Can you ask her for me?

423
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,220
Be serious.

424
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,780
All of you, stand with Jia Fan
for 40 minutes.

425
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,680
[...boost your presence instantly]

426
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
[First, we need to improve]

427
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
[our lower body strength.]

428
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,060
Can you tuck your chest?

429
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
You think you're doing a kip-up?

430
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,140
Can you lift your chin?

431
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,260
Feet.

432
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,380
Together!

433
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,780
Open your shoulders.

434
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,340
Time's up.

435
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,260
Have a break.

436
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,180
You're worn out after just 40 minutes?

437
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,940
Back in our day,

438
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,620
we trained
for at least an hour straight.

439
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,620
Yet you're still here.

440
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,220
What?

441
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Hey, enough.

442
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,580
We're running out of time too.

443
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,340
All right, that's it for today.

444
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,020
Dismissed.

445
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,860
Jia Fan.

446
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,620
You stay.

447
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,620
Why?

448
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,460
Out of everyone,
you have the weakest basics.

449
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,180
If you don't want
to embarrass yourself in Top Line,

450
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,220
you should work even harder.

451
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,140
Chen,

452
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,740
Fan is the hardest-working one

453
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
in the team.

454
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,420
Plus, we have less than 10 hours

455
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,500
to submit our vlogs.

456
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,300
How about you stay and train with him?

457
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,900
Go.

458
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,100
Chen is doing this for my own good.

459
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,420
He means well.

460
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,260
Go.

461
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,460
Train until 11 PM.

462
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,300
So you can catch the last bus.

463
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,420
Very thoughtful of you.

464
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,900
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

465
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,940
That's enough, Ning.

466
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,500
You should stop.

467
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,420
No.

468
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,220
I said I'll drink
until your boss shows up.

469
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,940
And I said

470
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,020
he's busy and won't come today.

471
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,460
What could he possibly be busy with?

472
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,540
The commercial is gone.

473
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,260
So is the endorsement.

474
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,780
He's like me.

475
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,220
We have nothing left

476
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,660
but time.

477
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,620
Yijing.

478
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,420
Where's Xing Mo?

479
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,180
Not in.

480
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,620
He won't come today.

481
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,620
What?

482
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,980
Are you here to console him?

483
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,420
Crocodile tears.

484
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,140
I won't get in the way
of you playing hypocrite.

485
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,380
Keep up the act.

486
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,580
Thank you so much.

487
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,140
She just wouldn't leave
no matter what I said.

488
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,660
The moment you came, she...

489
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,340
What?

490
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,580
Same question for you.

491
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,700
Why run away from me?

492
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,460
Who ran?

493
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,980
I'm just tired and need sleep.

494
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,300
It's okay.

495
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,900
I'll find out

496
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,380
one way or another.

497
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,820
You...

498
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,020
don't know?

499
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,140
Did Jia Fan not tell you anything?

500
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,980
Like what?

501
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,100
You looked so serious.

502
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,660
I thought you knew it.

503
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,940
I was just annoyed

504
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,860
and wanted to scare you.

505
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,620
I really didn't mean to…

506
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,580
What did you do?

507
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,780
Say it!

508
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,140
It's this late

509
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,460
and you're still not
getting your vlog ready?

510
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,180
Are you confident enough

511
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,260
or are you quitting?

512
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,180
I won't quit.

513
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,620
I just don't feel like
I have much of a chance.

514
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,260
Don't compare yourself with others.

515
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,500
Just showcase

516
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,020
your own strengths.

517
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,340
And those are not just your eyes.

518
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,500
I didn't get you into ACME

519
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,620
because of that.

520
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,300
I'm not that shallow.

521
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,900
People think

522
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,660
models are cold,

523
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,340
can't smile,

524
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,860
and lack warmth.

525
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,140
Like you said,

526
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,780
anyone can walk a few steps
with a poker face

527
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,900
and a careless attitude.

528
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,500
I was just talking nonsense.

529
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,220
It was a stereotype.

530
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,900
Then break that stereotype.

531
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,420
Use your warmth and relatability

532
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,300
that others don't have.

533
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,860
Don't compete over others' strengths.

534
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,100
Highlight what makes you unique,

535
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,540
even if it's a flaw.

536
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,140
Hurry up.

537
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,900
I look forward to your vlog tomorrow.

538
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,060
I asked Huang Jinde to take photos

539
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,380
of you with Jia Fan.

540
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,380
But Jia Fan ended up hitting him

541
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,020
and taking the memory card in the park.

542
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,300
So believe me,

543
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,580
I've got nothing with me.

544
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,860
It's all with Jia Fan.

545
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,820
Don't compare yourself with others.

546
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,180
Just showcase

547
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,380
your own strengths.

548
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,260
Use your warmth and relatability

549
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,220
that others don't have.

550
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,220
Don't compete over others' strengths.

551
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,980
Highlight

552
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,020
what makes you unique,

553
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
