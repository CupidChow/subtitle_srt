00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,620
Morning.

3
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,100
You are here.

4
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,500
I brought you some breakfast,

5
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,780
freshly fried youtiao.

6
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,380
For me?

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,060
You seem drowsy.

8
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,460
You're the best admin ever.

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,260
Of course.

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,060
I'm leaving now. Bye.

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,540
Bye.

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,060
Why are you here?

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,300
Did you get fired?

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,460
Were you up all night
playing Mahjong again?

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,500
Please don't tell Dong Xiaoru.

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,060
Hush money goes into the bonus, okay?

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,660
Don't move.

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,580
Hey, don't move.

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,300
Turn around.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,060
Turn around. Come on.

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,860
What happened to your face?

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,500
Did you fall again?

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,900
Were you in a fight?

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,740
Don't tell my dad.

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,620
Deal.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,020
The evaluation is coming up soon.

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,260
I'll be busy in a few days,

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,380
so I'm getting as much done
as I can now.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,420
You actually have free time?

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,820
Fan,

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,940
I truly regret it.

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,700
I shouldn't have...

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,380
What are you up to?

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,220
You gave me a share of the business.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,420
You can't take it back.

36
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,100
I shouldn't have stopped you.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,340
I really shouldn't.

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,180
I should've let you go to France
to be a head chef.

39
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,580
I was too selfish.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,380
You're still young.

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,220
This is your time to chase your dreams.

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,380
Isn't that exactly what I'm doing?

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
Once I pass this evaluation,
I'll be a real model.

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,460
How can being a model
compare to being a head chef?

45
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,660
A chef's job is way more stable!

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,140
Models just dress up

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,740
and walk back and forth,

48
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,500
barely scraping by

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,780
with an unstable paycheck.

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,060
But chefs?

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,020
The older they get,
the more valued they are, right?

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,060
Models, on the other hand,
rely on youth.

53
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,980
Once that's gone,
they'll be left with nothing,

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,740
starting over from square one.

55
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,380
This won't do.

56
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540
Fan, listen to me.

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,140
Call that Miss Qu right now.

58
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,220
If she says yes,

59
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,580
you're flying to France tomorrow.

60
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,860
Stop it, Ms. Dong.

61
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,620
It's just too late.

62
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,340
How can it be too late?

63
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,780
She's crazy about you!

64
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,140
Just say the word,

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,300
and I bet

66
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,300
she'd hand you all of France
on a silver platter.

67
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,580
Who's that?

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,060
She looks familiar.

69
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,740
My boss.

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh, no.

71
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,180
Hello, boss.

[You Matter More Than the Opportunity]

73
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,220
What happened to your face?

74
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,780
It's nothing.

75
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,340
I just hit it by accident.

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Then be careful.

77
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,980
Don't let it affect your evaluation.

78
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,020
But it doesn't matter if it does, right?

79
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,260
Do you regret going into modeling?

80
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,020
Are you secretly hoping to fail

81
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,580
so you can have a perfect excuse
to go to France

82
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,700
and be Miss Qu's head chef?

83
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,020
Wait. When did I ever say that?

84
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,940
I told you right from the start

85
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,980
that modeling would be a career
that depended on youth,

86
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,980
but you were dead set

87
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,780
on doing it anyway.

88
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,340
Well, yeah.

89
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,980
Now's the time
to take advantage of my youth.

90
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,220
A head chef's career
can last a lifetime.

91
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,940
Are you jealous?

92
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,580
I'm not jealous.

93
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,540
I'm serious.

94
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,020
It's not too late to change your mind.

95
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,020
Then let me tell you this seriously.

96
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,100
Modeling isn't just a job for me.

97
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,820
It's my mom's dream, my dad's regret,

98
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,540
and the best decision I've ever made.

99
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,180
So I won't change my mind.

100
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,580
Then why did you turn down Whim?

101
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,140
Being on the cover

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,220
would be the fastest way

103
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,340
to fulfill your mom's dream,

104
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,420
ease your dad's regret,

105
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,100
and prove that you made
the right choice.

106
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,180
So that's what this is all about.

107
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,620
I know what you're thinking,

108
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,700
but I still hope you'll reconsider.

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,140
I really don't get what you're thinking.

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Why did you agree this time?

111
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,740
Was it because of me again?

112
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,500
Ms. Han,

113
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,700
you've done enough.

114
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,020
So just leave it be this time, okay?

115
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm doing this for myself, all right?

116
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,260
It's the cover of Whim, after all.

117
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,620
Do you know how many people
would kill for this chance?

118
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,780
Then just shoot it by yourself.

119
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,340
Wouldn't a solo cover be even better?

120
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,980
Jia Fan.

121
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,660
I never even wanted to be on the cover,

122
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,020
let alone with you.

123
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,060
Why didn't you say so earlier?

124
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,900
I did say it, but you insisted...

125
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,700
You were the one
who had to play it so cool,

126
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,100
and now that you got picked,
you're blaming me?

127
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm not blaming you.

128
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,860
I just never imagined I'd get picked.

129
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,980
If I had known, I wouldn't have run
around the whole market

130
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,100
just to find you something to wear.

131
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,300
Looks like the outfit
was a success after all.

132
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm very...

133
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,460
Thank you.

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,580
Looks like you've uncovered
another talent.

135
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,940
If you ever stop modeling,

136
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,420
you could always be a designer, right?

137
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,620
Will you stop talking?

138
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,820
Hello?

139
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,380
I heard the chatter from way off.

140
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,420
Turns out it really is an old friend.

141
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,220
Just got a fresh batch

142
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,060
of trendy new arrivals.

143
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,460
Swing by anytime,

144
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,620
and I'll give you a discount.

145
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,740
Will you go?

146
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,060
Get lost.

147
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,340
Slow down a bit.

148
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,300
No need to worry about me.

149
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:56,860
Hold on.

150
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,180
Isn't it me who should be mad?

151
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,900
My girlfriend is working with her ex.

152
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,940
Join me then if you dare.

153
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,660
So we both have to treat him
as the client

154
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,860
and take his orders together?

155
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,380
Can you put your pride aside

156
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,380
and just treat this
like an ordinary job?

157
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,140
No, I can't.

158
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,220
I never expected you

159
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,420
to be the first one
to try convincing me.

160
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,780
I don't want you to miss
such a great opportunity.

161
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,340
I don't care.

162
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,180
There will always be more opportunities.

163
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,180
Think it over yourself.

164
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,900
There's plenty of time.

165
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,940
I've made up my mind.

166
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,580
I don't need to think it over.

167
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,180
Stop following me.

168
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,380
I'll walk you to your car.

169
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,660
No need.

170
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,740
Is it hurting again?

171
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,060
Leave me alone. Just go back.

172
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,900
I'll take you to the hospital.

173
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,940
No need, I'll go by myself.

174
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,660
Han Yijing, stop being so stubborn.

175
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,740
These are two different things.

176
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,740
So what?

177
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,620
What are you doing?

178
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,500
Keep this up,

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,180
and I'll just scoop you up.

180
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,460
Put me down! People are watching.

181
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,380
Will you behave now?

182
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,020
Just steady me.

183
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,780
Careful.

184
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,340
Hello?

185
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,540
Ms. Ling.

186
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,980
You Ning is here at the company.

187
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,420
You can talk to her.

188
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,380
[Fss Farmers Market]
I'm busy here. I can't go back.

189
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,380
All right.

190
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Oh, one more thing.

191
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,420
Whim just called.

192
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
They said

193
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,620
that if this collaboration works out,

194
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,420
they can sign

195
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,100
a long-term strategic deal with ACME,

196
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,460
and all terms are open for discussion.

197
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,460
A brand must have approached them.

198
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,220
I think if Jia Fan really can't do it,

199
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,660
we can replace him

200
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
or make it a solo shoot.

201
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,140
After all, the brands

202
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,260
are only interested in Yijing.

203
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,780
She won't agree.

204
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,180
Who?

205
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,140
Liao Jinyuan?

206
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,420
Without Jia Fan,
there would be no Han Yijing.

207
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,060
What do you mean?

208
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,940
Just wait a little longer.

209
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,540
We'll have an answer soon.

210
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,780
Ms. Ling is unavailable today,

211
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
so I'll be the one talking to you.

212
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,740
I knew she wouldn't come.

213
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
She's definitely still mad at me.

214
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,380
Don't flatter yourself.

215
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,340
Ms. Ling is busy with the cover

216
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,060
and doesn't have time to be mad at you.

217
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,740
How's the cover coming along?

218
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,900
Has it been decided?

219
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,340
Not yet,

220
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,300
but it's almost certain.

221
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Who is it?

222
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,580
Never mind.

223
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,820
I'll give you a heads-up now

224
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,700
so you won't make a scene later.

225
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,340
Han Yijing?

226
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,300
And Jia Fan.

227
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,740
Listen, You Ning.

228
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,180
The only reason you're back this time

229
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,900
is because Ms. Ling
still values old ties.

230
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
But this is the last time.

231
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,260
Don't go stirring up trouble again,

232
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,060
especially when it comes to Han Yijing.

233
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,660
Was it Jinyuan

234
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,060
who picked them?

235
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm not sure,

236
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,060
but it definitely needs his approval.

237
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,660
This is exciting!

238
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,780
When's the official announcement?

239
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,660
Where's the shoot?

240
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,660
Can I visit the set?

241
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,700
It's a full-blown drama.

242
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,660
Two men, and one woman,

243
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,100
tangled in love and hate.

244
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,020
If I were Han Yijing,
I'd break down on the spot.

245
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,060
This is the drama of the year.

246
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,900
I have to see it.

247
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,820
Wait a second.

248
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
What did you just say?

249
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,300
Han Yijing's dating Jia Fan?

250
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,060
I didn't come back to win her back.

251
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,300
I just wanted to see how she's doing.

252
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,460
She made a comeback
in less than three years

253
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,780
and immediately became
the top model again.

254
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,820
Is that even possible?

255
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,300
No way.

256
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,940
I know her too well.

257
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,980
The more she acts like this,

258
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,300
the worse she's actually doing.

259
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,060
She's just putting on a front

260
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,580
to prove something
to those who mocked her...

261
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,140
and

262
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,420
to me.

263
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,580
Then why do you work so hard?

264
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,980
Why didn't you change careers
after the accident?

265
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,980
If I changed careers like that,

266
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,260
I might as well die.

267
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,380
Hello?

268
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,060
Why aren't you back yet?

269
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,100

270
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,060
I'll be back soon.

They're not really
going to fire you, are they?

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,860
Coming.

274
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Come back soon.

275
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,500
It's crazy busy here. We're shorthanded.

276
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,500
Got it.

277
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,820
How is she?

278
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,220
She's fine now.

279
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,260
She just fell asleep.

280
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,220
Does she have to stay in the hospital?

281
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,300
No.

282
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,580
She can go home once she wakes up.

283
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,940
So soon?

284
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,180
Shouldn't she stay a few more days
for observation?

285
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,660
How did this happen all of a sudden?

286
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,060
Doctor, please be honest with me.

287
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
I won't tell anyone.

288

Who are you to her, exactly?

289

Her medical record

290
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,980
is confidential,

291
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,580
and I need her consent to share it.

292
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,940
But

293
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,820
as you know,

294
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,260
she's never going to agree to that.

295
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,380
Otherwise, she wouldn't have been

296
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,500
coming here alone all these years,

297
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,220

298
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,660
Okay.

299
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,340
I won't force her.

300
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Please take good care of her.

301

Thank you.

He's left.

303
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,300
Did you tell him anything?

304
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,540
I wouldn't dare.

305
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,740
I really don't get you.

he's the only one
who's taken you to the hospital.

308

And not just once, but twice.

309
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,140
Now that he knows everything,

310
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,420
why keep hiding it from him?

311
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,700
He genuinely cares about you.

312
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,700
He's been busy taking care of things

313
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,860
and hasn't even had a sip of water.

314
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,460
All he's been asking about is you.

315
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,620
That's exactly why I can't tell him.

316
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,220
If he knew, he'd never agree to it.

317
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,540
All right.

318
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,500
It's very tasty.

319
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,340

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,780
Everyone involved is connected to me.

374
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,180
One after another,

375
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,700
I'm the one left to clean up the mess.

376
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,300
Wrap this up fast.

377
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,140
If I can't catch a break,

378
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,100
neither can you.

379
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,420
Tell everyone

380
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,260
we'll be closed for tonight.

381
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,140
Everyone needs to be gone by 8 PM,

382
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,780
including you.

383
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,620
Okay.

384
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,340
Mo, wait for me.

385
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,300
Jinyuan.

386
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,140
See you around. I'm off.

387
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,860
Bye.

388
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,940
[Closed]

389
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,180
Why clear the whole place?

390
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,100
Wouldn't a private room be enough?

391
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,220
Since you've graced us
with your presence,

392
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,820
it's the least we can do.

393
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,620
Then why just a soft drink for me?

394
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,540
You can't drink alcohol right now.

395
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,620
Why?

396
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,980
Look at this place.

397
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,980
It's practically turned
into a shelter for ACME models.

398
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,740
You Ning and Haoran are here every day.

399
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,700
I had no choice but to clear the place.

400
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,100
Let's cut to the chase.

401
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,460
Say whatever you need to say,

402
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,820
and cry if you have to.

403
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,020
I'm just mad.

404
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,060
Such a great opportunity
is right in front of him,

405
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,820
yet he refuses to take it.

406
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,100
He won't listen to anyone.

407
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
He's stubborn as a mule.

408
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
Shooting for a magazine
is routine work for a model,

409
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,860
even if the client is Liao Jinyuan.

410
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,780
Work is work.

411
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,580
Why bring personal feelings into it?

412
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,020
Even I, the one directly involved,
can let it go.

413
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Can you really let it go?

414
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,060
Can you really keep it
strictly professional with Liao Jinyuan?

415
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,900
Yes.

416
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,100
You don't even have
the slightest discomfort?

417
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,340
Xing Mo,

418
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,980
I came to see you today

419
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,260
to ask you to talk to Jia Fan.

420
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,620
What a coincidence.

421
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,900
He called me before you came,

422
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,140
hoping I'd talk to you.

423
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,620
No wonder you didn't let me drink.

424
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,420
What did he tell you?

425
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,100
He said...

426
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,660
he wouldn't want you
to compromise for his sake.

427
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,460
Also,

428
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,620
if he agreed to this

429
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,380
and it made him famous,

430
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,900
he'd never be able
to hold his head up...

431
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,900
especially in front of you.

432
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,700
Don't you see?

433
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,780
To him...

434
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,100
you mattered more than the opportunity.

435
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,300
You two weren't fighting at all.

436
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,580
It was just affection in disguise.

437
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,460
Actually, I already know

438
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,860
everything he said.

439
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,900
Then why are you forcing him?

440
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,620
I want to help him while I still can.

441
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,700
Once the time comes...

442
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,740
What happens then?

443
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,820
What did the doctor say?

444
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,340
Listen, Han Yijing.

445
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,020
You'd better tell me the truth.

446
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,620
Don't make me go and find out myself.

447
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,700
She said...

448
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,580
I might not make it to next year.

449
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,460
But that's fine.

450
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,220
I was prepared for this the day
I made my comeback.

451
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,780
Every show I perform in now
feels like a bonus.

452
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,140
Besides,

453
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,980
I'll be thirty next year.

454
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,860
Rather than waiting to be replaced...

455
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,740
I'd rather make a graceful exit

456
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,660
at my peak.

457
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,340
Does he know?

458
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
He cannot know.

459
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,940
At least, not now.

460
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,780
I didn't expect you
to care so much about him.

461
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,780
Even now,
you're still putting him first.

462
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,220
I didn't expect this either.

463
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,700
When I first met him,

464
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,060
he kept helping me again and again.

465
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,020
I thought he had an ulterior motive,

466
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,860
so I didn't appreciate it at all.

467
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,940
[Outpatient]
Instead, I caused him trouble.

468
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,340
I even stopped him from joining
the model competition.

469
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,660
And now,

470
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,820
I'm the one forcing him to use me.

471
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,140
I know

472
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,180
that in many people's eyes,

473
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,740
he's not good enough.

474
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,620
He's got no degree

475
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,860
and no proper job,

476
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,540
just spending his days
at a seafood shop,

477
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,900
taking care of his blind father.

478
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,460
But he never sees it that way.

479
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,740
He never complains, not even once.

480
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,580
He's happier than most people.

481
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,540
He's confident,

482
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,940
optimistic,

483
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,340
and kind,

484
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,460
with a light in his eyes
that never dims.

485
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,940
Compared to him,

486
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
I have nothing

487
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,780
except those glamorous labels.

488
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,500
He's the one who showed me

489
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,060
there's more to life than work,

490
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,020
who gave me something
to look forward to.

491
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,580
Suddenly, not being able
to walk the runway

492
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,780
doesn't seem so terrifying anymore.

493
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,420
[Hailiwang Seafood]
Because of him, I now believe

494
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,340
that even if I'm not

495
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,260
Han Yijing, the shining star on stage,

496
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,140
someone will still love me.

497
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,980
So it may look like

498
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,620
I'm helping him,

499
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,140
but the truth is, he saved me.

500
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,100
He's the one
who made me feel truly alive.

501
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,260
That's the Han Yijing I know,

502
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,220
fearless as ever,

503
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,540
never looking back.

504
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
What's the point of love
if it's all about

505
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,740
weighing the pros and cons?

506
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,300
Actually, Liao Jinyuan
had no other choice before.

507
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:11,940
Otherwise, he...

508
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,740
I know.

509
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,700
I heard that recording.

510
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,420
At first, he did have an agenda.

511
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,420
But later…

512
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,580
Yet, he still left.

513
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,380
Maybe he was worried about his future,

514
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,940
or maybe it was for me.

515
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,300
But none of that matters.

516
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,340
What matters

517
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,740
is that he left.

518
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,340
He has no idea

519
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,740
what I truly care about.

520
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,420
Anyway.

521
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,820
Will you help me or not?

522
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,340
I will.

523
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,540
Stop trying to force him.

524
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,100
Let him make his own decision.

525
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,020
After all that talk,

526
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,180
you're helping him instead.

527
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,580
I'm helping you too.

528
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,700
Don't use caring for him
as an excuse to hurt him.

529
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,660
Don't become the second Liao Jinyuan.

530
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,780
Fine, you win.

531
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,180
I'm leaving now.

532
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,100
Did you hear all that?

533
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,780
Are you going after her or not?

534
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,100
If not, I'll go.

535
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,820
I've been asked

536
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,020
to take her home.

537
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,140
Yijing!

538
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,420
I'm sorry.

539
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,420
It was my idea.

540
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,020
I wanted to know what you really think.

541
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,900
I used to think I was the victim

542
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,180
and that it was Han Jialing's fault.

543
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,180
If it weren't for her,

544
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,820
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

545
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,580
But now I understand.

546
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,500
It wasn't anyone else who ruined us.

547
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,460
It was me.

548
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,140
From now on, I'll do what you've said.

549
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,940
I won't bother you again.

550
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,660
Let's just pretend we don't know
each other when we meet.

551
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,020
Also...

552
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,660
you don't need to forgive me.

553
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,460
Liao Jinyuan.

554
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,420
What happened to your face?

555
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,740
Did you get into a fight with Jia Fan?

556
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,220
Yes.

557

He won.

558
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,340
Let's go. I'll take you home.

559
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,140
Traitor.

560
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,820
We are all men.

561
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,300
So, of course, we'll help each other.

562
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,700
Then help him all the way.

563
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,740
Call that guy and tell him

564
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,100
you've convinced me.

565
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,380
I'll listen to him.

566
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,620
Are you also a traitor now?

567
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,420
What can I do?

568
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,100
He's already hit the client.

569
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,060
What a liar.

570
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,540
He told me it was an accident.

571
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,460
Hey, Mo.

572
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,860
Okay.

573
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,940
All right. Got it.

574
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,700
Thanks, Mo.

[Yijing has given up.]

576
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,860
Let's make an announcement

577
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,660
tomorrow morning.

578
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,940
What?

579
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,940
What's wrong?

580
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,740
[ACME]
Nothing.

581
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,580
Even you're talking.
Something's definitely off.

582
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,660
Jia Fan no longer needs
to undergo evaluation.

583
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,620
He's been expelled from Top Line.

584
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,020
[Announcement]
Why did he suddenly get fired?

585
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,980
Wasn't he
Ms. Ling's most valued new talent?

586
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
He must have made a serious mistake,

587
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,940
one that's unforgivable.

588
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Is it because of his poor character?

589
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,540
His lack of skills?

590
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,660
Or does he have some shady past?

591
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,500
I heard he rejected Whim's cover offer.

592
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,820
Turns out he's out of his mind.

593
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,020
The group is in an uproar,

594
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,260
especially the newbies.

595
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,820
Congrats!

596
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,420
You've finally
gotten rid of the eyesore.

597
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,700
I suppose patience
really does pay off, huh?

598
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,980
I'm not that kind of person.

599
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,740
But I have to admit,

600
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,380
he was by far
the most outstanding among them.

601
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,660
[Ding Chen]
It's truly a shame.

602

Captain Hindsight.

603
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,460
So annoying.

604
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,940
What's happening in the group chat?

605
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,140
Does Han Yijing know about this?

606
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,660
Jia Fan, you can't go in.

607
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,060
Ms. Ling, he...

608
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,940
Go out

609
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,740
and shut the door.

610
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,820
Okay.

611
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,860
I've been waiting for you.

612
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:49,820
Take a seat.

613
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,460
Why?

614
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,260
I can leave,

615
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,100
but you need to give me a reason.

616
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:56,940
All right.

617
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,740
Then answer this first.

618
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,420
Why did you turn down Whim?

619
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,140
I've already talked to Ming about this.

620
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,500
Stop using pride to fool me.

621
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,580
It's only natural for seniors
to mentor juniors.

622
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,940
Is that the reason?

623
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,140
You didn't shoot
what you should have,

624
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,420
but insisted on shooting
what you shouldn't.

625
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,100
In the end, you even managed
to convince Han Yijing

626
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,220
to listen to you.

627
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,740
Why?

628
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,780
Because you two
aren't just mentor and mentee,

629
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,020
but also a couple.

630
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,180
How long have you been together?

631
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,780
It's been over three months.

You're the one
I have the highest hopes for

633
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,860
among the new recruits.

634
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,420
I gave you one opportunity
after another,

635
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,580
and this is how you repay me?

636
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,900
To do this right under my nose…

637
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
There's nothing wrong
with being in a relationship.

638
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,700
Then why keep it a secret?

639
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,660
Because she's scared.

Personally and professionally,

00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,860
I won't let you two be together.

While you haven't been together
for long,

I'll let you come back,

654

as if nothing happened.

655
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
I'll continue giving you chances

656

to help you achieve your dream.

658
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,100
Otherwise, all the effort you've put in
these past few months will be wasted,

659
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,140
and you can forget about

ever stepping into
the modeling industry again.
