79
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,260
Maybe he thought
the competition in our industry

81
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,620

191
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,740
Is he also the reason

192
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,860
Yijing has changed?

193
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,980
Karl Lagerfeld once said

194
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,820
that true fashion

195
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
is about mastering

196
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,180
the style that suits you best.

197
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,980
For example,

198
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,060
even if we dress

199
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,420
like Gigi Hadid,

200
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,820
we'll never be her.

201
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,380
So instead of blindly copying others,

202
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,740
we should find our own style,

203
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,340
highlight our strengths,

204
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,940
and craft a unique personal image.

205
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,580
After all, we are not mannequins,

206
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,380
we are

207
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,460
models.

208
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,580
Ms. Han.

209
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,740
Why don't you give us a demonstration?

210
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,060
After all, practice makes perfect.

211
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,380
Ms. Han, show us how it's done.

212
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,260
Consider it a bonus for everyone.

213
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,340
I wouldn't call it a bonus.

214
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,260
It's our chance
to learn from each other.

215
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,900
So, who would like to be my model?

216
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,260
Me.

217
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,100
Me! Ms. Han.

218
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Ms. Han, pick me.

219
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,980
Pick me, please.

220
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,540
Pick me.

221
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,300
He's here.

222
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,700
He's the last one, right?

223
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,980
But…

224
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,140
Didn't they say he backed out
at the last minute?

225
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,460
I have no idea.

226
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,940
Hi, everyone.

227
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,020
I'm Jia Fan,

228
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,340
the last new model

229
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,540
to join Top Line.

230
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,780
I wasn't able to meet you all earlier

231
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,820
due to some personal reasons,

232
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,420
but I promise it won't happen again.

233
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,380
I'll stay disciplined.

234
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,780
Looking forward to working with you all.

235
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,660
Was that really him on the motorbike?

236
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,260
Go ahead and teach him a lesson.

237
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,380
So, he's the one who backed out
at the last minute?

238
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,260
He's our team's coffee guy.

239
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,780
Didn't they say being late
would result in disqualification?

240
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,300
We're all new here,

241
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,780
so we should support each other.

242
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,180
The notice clearly stated

243
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,540
that being late means giving up.

244
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,820
Yes, that's why I wasn't late.

245
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,540
You weren't late?

246
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,820
I even arrived 10 minutes early.

247
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,900
Then why didn't you attend the class?

248
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,340
The notice stated it was the time
to arrive at the training camp,

249
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,500
not the class time.

250
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,100
Who can prove that you arrived early?

251
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,900
Ms. Ling.

252
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,700
Ms. Ling?

253
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,100
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have found this place.

254
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,180
Looks like he's well-connected.

255
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,900
What's his background?

256
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,940
All right, go ahead and join the team.

257
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,900
A warm welcome
to our new member, Jia Fan.

258
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,020
Let's welcome him.

259
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,100
It seems that Ms. Ling
really has high hopes for him.

260
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,820
Hold on.

261
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,620
Since Ms. Ling has made her decision,

262
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,580
we have nothing more to say.

263
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,340
But we should still respect the opinions

264
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,140
of other new members, right?

265
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,380
It wouldn't be fair otherwise.

266
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,020
We have no objections.

267
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Since Ms. Ling has spoken,

268
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
we'll follow her lead.

269
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,700
Besides,

270
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,540
he wasn't late.

271
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,140
He just missed the first class.

272
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,420
Don't worry, Ms. Han.

273
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,740
We'll pass on the message properly.

274
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,940
Is that all right?

275
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,260
- Absolutely!
- Absolutely!

276
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,180
That's totally all right.

277
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,820
Welcome aboard, Fan.

278
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
A big welcome to you.

279
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,500
So your talent
is being a flip-flopper, huh?

280
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,580
We're all new here, so we need

281
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,500
to support each other.

282
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,260
Ms. Han,

283
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,060
may I take my seat?

284
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,820
Not yet.

285
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,140
Ms. Han just happens to need a model.

286
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,980
It's time for you

287
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,900
to undergo some transformation.

288
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
This guy

289
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,660
is no pushover.

290
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,300
Only ten minutes left.

291
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,820
You sure know how to push the limit.

292
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,420
Ms. Ling,

293
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
But I'm not actually late this time.

295
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,540
That's up to me to decide.

296
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,460
Then I'll push my luck one more time,

297
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,740
just this one last time.

298
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Then explain why.

299
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,380
Why the sudden change of mind?

300
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,220
You're hopeless.

301
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,020
Just go sit down.

302
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,820
Is it me who's hopeless,

303
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,780
or are you out of solutions?

304
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,140
I already let you stay.

305
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,420
So don't push it.

306
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,780
Okay then,

307
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,340
since Ms. Han won't do it,

308
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
I guess I'll have to step up

309
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,500
and give her a makeover instead.

310
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,500
Relax.

311
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,380
What are you doing?

312
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,340
Stay still.

313
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,660
That's nice.

314
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,020
Ms. Han,

315
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,380
please lift your foot.

316
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,700
Is there any difference?

317
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,220
You wouldn't understand.

318
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,340
What do you know?

319
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,260
Impressive.

320
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,660
Good for him.

321
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,660
He actually caught Yijing off guard.

322
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,900
I allowed him to return,

323
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,740
but not to deal with Han Yijing.

324
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,700
Then,

325
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,140
is it Xing Mo?

326
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,940
What's wrong?
Is it something you can't talk about?

327
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,780
It's the same reason I gave
at the audition.

328
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,420
That's not enough.

329
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,140
Since it's your second time,

330
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,780
it needs to be even more persuasive.

331
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,900
Because...

332
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,180
Because I...

333
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,700
Because you inherited
your dad's condition

334
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,420
and might lose your sight at any time?

335
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,300
Be honest.

336
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,380
What's the real reason?

337
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,140
I don't care what you told Ms. Ling.

338
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
You have to give me a reason.

339
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,380
I don't want you to look down on me.

340
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Knock it off.

341
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,580
You back off the moment
you make progress,

342
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,300
then suddenly pop up again
at the last minute.

343
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,940
What is it? A game to you?

344
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,460
Or do you think

345
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,820
this will get you more attention?

346
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,260
Annoying, isn't it?

347
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,300
I promise it won't happen again.

348
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
You'd better be.

349
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,980
I checked with the hospital.

350
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,980
Don't misunderstand.

351
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,660
I'm not interested in your business.

352
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,780
I was just curious.

353
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,420
How does someone

354
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,260
change overnight

355
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,460
and come up
with a bunch of lousy excuses?

356
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,660
So what if you fell

357
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,660
and fractured a bone?

358
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,820
You're a grown man, all right.

359
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,020
Quit being so dramatic.

360
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,860
You're right.

361
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,260
That's why I'm adopting a new style

362
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,740
and learn from you.

363
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,860
Me?

364
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,940
What's my style?

365
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,820
You never accept fate, never compromise,

366
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,340
and always move forward.

367
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,740
I also keep my word and follow through.

368
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,780
Why are you looking at me like that?

369
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,100
Thank you.

370
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,820
Thank you for letting me
step onto the stage,

371
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,820
for cutting my hair,

372
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,460
and for teaching me how to pose.

373
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,620
Thank you for telling me

374
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,540
how tough this path is.

375
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,020
Thank you for what you said to me
at the hospital.

376
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,980
Also,

377
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,900
thank you for being my model.

378
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,980
I was just...

379
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,060
You were just disappointed in me.

380
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,900
If it weren't for you,

381
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,540
I wouldn't have ended up
on this path of no return.

382
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,740
So, you have to take responsibility.

383
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,140
Otherwise,
you wouldn't even care about me.

384
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,340
After all, you aren't the type
to meddle in other people's business.

385
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,140
It's good that you get it.

386
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,620
The rest is up to you now.

387
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,220
And

388
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,780
don't be late.

389
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,900
Did you purposely
give me a hard time earlier?

390
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,540
You were worried
that they'd have a problem with it,

391
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,300
so you tried to act
as angry and harsh as possible

392
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
to appease them,

393
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,300
making it easier for me
to join the team,

394
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,340
right?

395
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,420
No.

396
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,900
I was simply annoyed.

397
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,980
Don't overthink it.

398
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,260
All right.

399
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,900
Guess I read too much into it.

400
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,700
Don't do it again.

401
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,700
Thank you.

402
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,940
Your mom's life didn't turn out
the way it should have,

403
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,900
but she has a great son.

404
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,060
He not only inherited her talent

405
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,900
but also her dreams.

406
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,180
More importantly,

407
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,300
he got the opportunity she never had.

408
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,460
If I were

409
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,980
to ruin that,

410
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,020
how could I ever face her

411
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,940
when I meet her in the afterlife?

412
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,060
She'd probably kick me.

413
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,580
Dad...

414
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,540
Forget about what I think.

415
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,500
Just do whatever you want,

416
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,980
but make sure it's something
you truly love.

417
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,820
Whether it's becoming a chef

418
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,940
or a model,

419
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,260
neither path is easy.

420
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,740
But so what?

421
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,300
Follow your heart.

422
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,380
Don't worry about me at all.

423
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,660
Only then

424
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,100
will I, as your father,

425
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,620
not feel

426
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,300
so guilty.

427
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,420
Besides, you're only twenty-five.

428
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,380
Medical advancements
are happening rapidly.

429
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,540
No need to stress.

430
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,060
There's bound to be a solution
in the future.

431
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,500
What's the matter?

432
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,420
Nothing.

433
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Just thought I'd treat you
to a cup of coffee.

434
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,220
We've been busy for so long,

435
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,500
and things are finally wrapping up.

436
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,380
Both the hype and the contestants

437
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,100
have far exceeded our expectations.

438
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,300
It's time to take a well-deserved break.

439
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,300
Once the orientation event
is over tomorrow,

440
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,380
you'll be completely free.

441
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,860
Plenty of chances to relax after that.

442
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,380
I was talking about you.

443
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,260
My main task this time

444
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,380
is to keep an eye on You Ning.

445
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
The more crucial the moment,

446
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,220
the more I need to stay sharp.

447
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,780
I have no right to relax.

448
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,740
Apart from You Ning,

449
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,220
try paying more attention
to Jia Fan too.

450
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Jia Fan?

451
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,620
He's resilient, ambitious,

452
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,060
and has a story to tell.

453
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,740
He's a rare talent with great potential.

454
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,860
Whether he can truly shine in the end

455
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,140
depends on how he's nurtured.

456
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,300
That's where you,
as his senior, come in.

457
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,860
ACME has lots of capable seniors.

458
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm not that special.

459
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,220
But you're the most suited for this.

460
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,380
He's just like you were back then.

461
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,620
You and Yijing truly are family.

462
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,260
She's said the exact same thing before.

463
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,740
So, is it because of me
that you keep giving him

464
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,660
a free pass?

465
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,380
Yes.

466
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,900
I want you to know

467
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,260
that if I could turn you

468
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,300
into ACME's ace,

469
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,100
I can do the same for him.

470
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Thanks for the coffee.

471
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,940
Take your time and enjoy it.

472
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,940
Hello.

473
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Have you heard?

474
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,620
Not only did he show up,

475
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
but he also argued with Han Yijing
in front of everyone.

476
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,540
I can't believe I missed
such a big drama of the year!

477
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,420
What was I thinking,
taking a beauty nap?

478
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
I regret it so much.

479
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,540
That fishmonger...

480
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,300
I mean, what exactly
is Jia Fan's background?

481
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,020
Maybe he's too inexperienced
to be afraid,

482
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,980
but how could he
completely disregard someone

483
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,900
as fierce as Han Yijing?

484
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,420
Could it be...?

485
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,980
What are you trying to say now?

486
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,420
The fierce Han Yijing
might have been tamed.

487
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,260
Listen.

488
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,980
When a guy and a girl first meet,

489
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,020
the more they argue,

490
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,780
the more it shows
there's a subtle tension

491
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,500
between them.

492
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,820
They could easily go from fighting

493
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,220
to being together.

494
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,380
This is the classic "bickering couple."

495
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,540
So,

496
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,700
you need to stay alert

497
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,580
and not take things so lightly.

498
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,420
Cut the nonsense.

499
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,700
I don't care
about what's going on with them.

500
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,460
Are you jealous?

501
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,380
This is clearly love.

502
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,740
You are just in denial.

503
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,540
Just you wait.

504
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,220
I'll win for sure tomorrow.

505
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,660
Mo.

506
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,140
I haven't exercised in so long,

507
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,420
so I'm going for a run
since I don't have any classes.

508
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,420
Not bad.

509
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,260
Congratulations.

510
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,380
Thanks, Mo.

511
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,060
I remember the last time
we greeted each other

512
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,500
was in the company restroom.

513
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,620
Back then, you were just a delivery guy

514
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,460
and said you'd never participate
in the auditions.

515
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,500
Plans can't keep up with changes, right?

516
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,860
I guess I'm just really lucky,

517
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,220
and everyone has been so tolerant of me.

518
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,780
It's good that you understand.

519
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,780
Luck is temporary,

520
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,300
and tolerance has its limits.

521
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,940
The Billion Light Model Competition

522
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,180
has always been fair and strict,

523
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,540
yet time and time again,

524
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,580
rules have been bent for you.

525
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,780
If you really feel undeserving,

526
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,420
then pull yourself together,

527
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,180
deliver some impressive results,

528
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,500
and prove that you're worthy.

529
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,380
Don't ruin ACME's reputation.

530
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,780
I'm so sleepy.

531
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,900
It's not even 8 o'clock,

532
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,460
and it feels like military training.

533
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,660
Who wears flip-flops
during military training?

534
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,460
We waited so long
for the orientation event,

535
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,220
and now there are hardly
any welcoming elements.

536
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,660
It's just another meeting instead.

537
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,700
What else do you want?

538
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,700
A party?

539
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,140
There's no music, no lights, no food,

540
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,100
and no champagne.

541
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,260
Nice thought,

542
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,260
but are you paying?

543
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,980
Stop it.

544
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,540
At least they gave us something to wear.

545
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,180
Others don't even have
the chance to wear it.

546
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,700
But how can we just settle for this?

547
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,620
Everyone's wearing the same thing,

548
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,700
it feels like a school uniform.

549
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,580
Exactly.

550
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,420
It completely conceals my charm.

551
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,060
It seems that charm

552
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,420
comes from the person,

553
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,940
not the clothes.

554
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,020
How strange.

555
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,100
We're wearing the same clothes,

556
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,740
but the contrast is huge.

557
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,820
Wearing the same outfit
isn't a big deal,

558
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,260
it's the one who looks bad
that will feel awkward.

559
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,580
Morning, Ms. Han.

560
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,980
Did you sleep well?

561
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:08,860
Yes.

562
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,660
I slept pretty well.

563
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,060
I slept all right,

564
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,380
but waking up early is a bit tough.

565
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm not quite used to it.

566
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,380
Then get used to it quickly,

567
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,980
as the next couple of days
will be just like this.

568
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,220
Okay.

569
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,860
Go now. Welcome aboard.

570
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,660
Bye, Ms. Han.

571
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
Why are you staring at me?

572
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,580
Aren't you leaving?

573
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,460
Aren't you afraid of being late?

574
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
You haven't left either.

575
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,260
Aren't you afraid of being late?

576
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,500
As expected, you're always late.

577
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,180
What are you staring at?

578
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,340
You look nice.

579
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,460
The headband I chose really works.

580
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,140
Looks like the makeover was a success.

581
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,820
This style really suits you.

582
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,100
What do you mean this style suits me?

583
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,420
Listen.

584
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,380
It's not that the makeover
was successful,

585
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,980
it's that I can pull off any style.

586
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
I think so too.

587
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,780
Do your best.

588
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,420
I hope you truly learning something
from this experience

589
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
and won't just talk the talk.

590
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,500
Thanks for your encouraging words.

591
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,540
That's very thoughtful of you.

592
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,780
As your senior,

593
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,620
now that you've joined ACME,

594
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,060
of course, I should do something
to welcome you all.

595
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,500
It's a small gift,
but it carries my best wishes.

596
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,180
Welcome to the ACME family!

597
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
This is for you, Tian Chu.

598
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,620
Thanks.

599
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,340
Liu Jia.

600
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,140
Thank you, Ning.

601
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,500
Zi Xuan.

602
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,740
You shouldn't have, Ning.

603
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,580
Kong Ernuo.

604
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,380
Thank you.

605
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,140
Song Chuan.

606
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,100
Thank you, Ning.

607
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,620
Zhou Lu.

608
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,860
Thank you, Ning.

609
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,980
Why did you come empty-handed?

610
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,580
This is the orientation event.

611
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,020
That's not quite appropriate.

612
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,980
Immature.

613
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,500
Hypocritical.

614
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,460
Why are you wearing a headband?

615
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,580
Going for a different look?

616
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,060
Jia Fan.

617
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,780
Hi, Ms. You.

618
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,540
You are quite something.

619
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,900
You were late for both the audition

620
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,940
and registration.

621
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,300
You're the first one

622
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,260
who doesn't take ACME seriously.

623
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,140
I wouldn't dare.

624
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,460
I'm here now, aren't I?

625
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,100
Why then?

626
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:24,860
Is it...?

627
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,660
There's someone

628
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,740
I didn't want to let down,

629
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,060
so I had to be here.

630
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,260
Who is it?

631
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,420
Don't tell me

632
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,620
it's Han Jialing.

633
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,020
Hello, everyone.

634
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,260
Please gather up.

635
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,020
- Coming.
-Coming.

636
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,020
Good morning to all our old friends

637
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,140
and new members.

638
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,060
Today marks the first day
of our training camp for newcomers,

639
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,140
and it's also
the annual orientation event

640
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,540
for Top Line.

641
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,700
To put it simply,

642
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,620
if you're here today

643
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,700
and wearing our team uniform,

644
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,700
it means

645
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,100
you've officially joined

646
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,860
the ACME family.

647
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,140
We hope

648
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,140
that from now on,

649
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,540
we will grow together,
support each other,

650
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,740
and continue working together

651
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,380
for the foreseeable future.

652
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Now,

653
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,900
let's welcome the founder of ACME,

654
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,540
Ms. Han Jialing,

655
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
to say a few words.

656
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,420
Please welcome her.

657
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,940
Hello, everyone.

658
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,500
A warm welcome to all of you.

659
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,340
Today,

660
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,100
the stars

661
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,180
are the seven newcomers here.

662
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,900
Congratulations on officially becoming

663
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,140
part of Top Line.

664
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,700
You've made it
through countless challenges

665
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,540
with your hard work

666
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,900
and exceptional skills,

667
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,020
standing out from thousands

668
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,940
of competitors.

669
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,820
At this moment,

670
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,380
you must feel very proud

671
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,020
and accomplished.

672
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,380
But I have to bring

673
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,020
some reality into the picture.

674
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,300
In Top Line,

675
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,380
self-satisfaction
is the least valuable trait.

676
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,980
The most important things
are self-restraint

677
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,100
and self-management.

678
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,660
Without them, you'd struggle
to last even half a year.

679
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,980
This battle against yourself
will persist.

680
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,740
As some rise to the top,

681
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,260
others will inevitably be eliminated.

682
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,780
So, you must be mentally prepared.

683
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,180
If you lack the confidence
for this battle,

684
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,540
it might be better to quit early.

685
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,980
Simply forcing yourself through

686
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,100
will only waste your time.

687
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,500
However,

688
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,700
if you're determined to go all in

689
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,020
and have the courage to keep going
no matter the obstacles,

690
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,380
then Top Line

691
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,100
will be there to help.

692
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,220
Together,

693
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,380
we'll prove to those who were eliminated

694
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,380
that you won your place here

695
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,020
through skill,

696
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,500
and not mere luck.

697
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,940
Do your best, everyone.

698
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,620
We're excited to see how you'll perform.

699
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

700
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,820
I hope you will remember
her valuable advice.

701
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,500
For the next few days of training,

702
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,460
please continue to work hard.

703
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,980
We have a long way to go,

704
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,300
so make sure to give your best effort.

705
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,580
Now, it's time

706
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,780
for the newcomers' entrance.

707
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,740
As is Top Line's

708
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,220
long-standing tradition,

709
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,060
the floating runway awaits.

710
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,140
Only by successfully crossing
this runway

711
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,260
can you truly be a part of ACME.

712
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
You only get one chance.

713
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,500
Get ready,

714
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,820
