No way, this is too bizarre.

00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,100
Jia Fan refusing to cooperate

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,380
means Liao Jinyuan's plan fell through.

5
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,540
That's exactly what Ms. Ling wanted.

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,740
Why was he still fired?

7
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,780
How would I know?

8
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,820
He's not answering calls either.

9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,220
It was supposed to be a good thing.

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,820
But now one betrayed us

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,700
while the other just left.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,900
This is a classic case

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,700
of "penny wise, pound foolish".

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,940

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,620

00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,100

I asked around.

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,540
Their first choice is still ACME,

30
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,660
I think the current situation
is a bit complicated,

of politely declining first.

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,100

Why didn't I think of it sooner?

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,940
If you had thought of it earlier,

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,460

is just Ms. Ling.

with Ms. Ling's private matter,

190
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,660
but she's already...

191
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Then let's talk business.

192
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,540
What

193
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,900
brings you here?

194
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,500
The cover is confirmed.

195
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,380
Next Wednesday.

196
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,820
Just you.

197
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,660
I know

198
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,740
it's hard for you to accept,

199
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,460
but work is work.

200
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,060
Frankly speaking,

201
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
I think this matter

202
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
is beneficial

203
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,140
for both you and the company.

204
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,180
Ms. Ling knows too.

205
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,900
She was just...

206
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,860
Afraid I'd rekindle my past romance
with Liao Jinyuan.

207
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,420
Now that she knows about Jia Fan,

208
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,540
she has no more worries

209
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,660
and can welcome this collaboration
with open arms, right?

210
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,620
Ms. Ling is truly Ms. Ling.

211
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,140
Every step has been calculated.

212
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,620
It's not easy for her either,

213
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,460
balancing your perspective

214
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,780
and company interests.

215
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,340
If she put herself in my shoes,

216
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,780
she wouldn't do this.

217
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,980
Yijing.

218
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,980
Can I refuse?

219
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,540
If there were no Jia Fan,

220
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
would you refuse?

221
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,020
Calm down and think it through.

222
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,860
I'm sure she must have her reasons.

223
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,620
And everyone knows

224
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,220
you initially agreed,

225
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,340
only changing your decision
after Jia Fan left.

226
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,060
This is hard to explain.

227
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,100
No need to think.

228
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,700
I'll do it.

229
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,900
Fan.

230
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,620
Listen.

231
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,780
At first,

232
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,660
I so looked down on you.

233
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,900
You know why?

234
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,700
I thought you were mediocre
in every aspect,

235
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,540
but so confident.

236
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
Like Mr. Ding said,

237
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,260
why do all good things

238
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,540
come to you?

239
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,140
But...

240
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,940
Enough.

241
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,940
Real men don't revisit the past.

242
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,580
But what?

243
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,300
Meaning...

244
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,540
But,

245
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,220
seeing your current state,

246
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,140
suddenly I feel

247
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,940
at peace.

248
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,540
I feel like

249
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,220
good luck

250
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
isn't all positive.

251
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,460
Gaining something and then losing it

252
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,900
hurts more than never

253
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,620
having it at all.

254
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,060
But

255
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,780
a temporary setback

256
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,380
means getting

257
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,500
Han Yijing later.

258
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,460
Can we say that?

259
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,100
Liquid courage.

260
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
We're all bros here.
No need to be afraid.

261
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,180
Did you get fired

262
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,340
because you're dating Han Yijing?

263
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,500
When did it start?

264
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,900
Who pursued whom?

265
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,900
And

266
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,460
how far have you gotten?

267
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,980
You didn't break up over this, did you?

268
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,020
What's happening?

269
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,700
Fan.

270
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,900
Interview time.

271
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,940
That's all for today.

272
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,380
Boo.

273
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,180
You continue.

274
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,180
Have more drinks, Fan.

275
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,900
Leaving so soon?

276
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,380
No more.

277
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,300
Fan.

278
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,700
Where are you going?

279
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,700
I'm sober now.

280
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,380
Really, I can drink.

281
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,620
I can drink, Fan.

282
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,540
Sit.

283
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,580
Are you dating or not?

284
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,140
Give us some hints.

285
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,340
Don't leave.

286
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,700
Don't leave.

287
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,300
Till we meet again.

288
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,100
See you around.

289
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,020
Let's drink again tomorrow.

290
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,220
Don't forget us.

291
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,940
Bye.

292
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,500
Wait!

293
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,140
What?

294
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,580
I paid this time.

295
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,540
Sorry.

296
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,940
In the practice room, I...

297
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,700
Real men don't revisit the past.

298
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,140
Before joining the company,

299
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,820
I forced you to dinner.

300
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,740
This last meal,

301
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,380
you're here too,

302
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,340
still forced by me.

303
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,780
Somewhat of a full circle.

304
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,820
You should carry modeling...

305
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,900
through the end as well.

306
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,660
Do your best.

307
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,260
I'm leaving.

308
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,260
Gold.

309
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,460
Gold.

310
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,900
Little brat.

311
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Ungrateful.

312
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,500
You have it good.

313
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,660
Nothing to worry about.

314
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,260
Free and happy.

315
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,260
Fan.

316
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,740
Why are you here?

317
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,780
Waiting for me?

318
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,620
I know everything.

319
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,740
Friends at ACME told me.

320
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,780
Good connections.

321
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,020
What's the use?

322
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,580
Can't be of any help.

323
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,340
Why blame yourself?

324
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,300
It's my fault.

325
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,980
The chief stylist opportunity is gone.

326
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,180
Honestly,

327
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,940
from getting on the runway to auditions,

328
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,620
to shooting ads and covers,

329
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,540
all smooth sailing.

330
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,580
Your progress bar
has been moving too fast

331
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,340
that it made me nervous.

332
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
This feels steadier.

333
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,900
Pretty good.

334
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,300
Right.

335
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,140
This isn't bad.

336
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,420
Compared to what I've gained,

337
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,700
these losses are nothing.

338
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,940
What have you gained?

339
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,900
Wait...

340
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,780
You're not giving up, are you?

341
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,860
That's not what I meant.

342
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,820
I meant

343
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,620
we can slow down,

344
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,660
but we can't just stop.

345
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,700
I'll help you again
if that's what it takes.

346
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,020
If I can't be a chief stylist,

347
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,820
I'll be a top agent.

348
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,300
With my connections,

349
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,980
it'll be no problem.

350
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,580
Focus on your own work.

351
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,660
I already failed you.

352
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,180
I can't fail your mom too.

353
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,740
Stop fooling around with me.

354
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,540
Go home.

355
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,140
How is this fooling around?

356
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,380
You're looking down on me?

357
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,260
You've got to be kidding me.

358
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,580
I'm seriously working!

359
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,660
I'm building my career!

360
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,820
I can't believe it.

361
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,820
Hello?

362
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,140
Done shooting?

363
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,780
Your get-together is over?

364
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:58,980
Yeah.

365
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,260
I wanted to call,

366
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,340
but didn't want to interrupt.

367
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,500
Me too.

368
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,380
Didn't want to disturb your shoot.

369
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,300
What are you doing?

370
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,740
Just showered,

371
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,060
going to sleep.

372
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,060
You?

373
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,020
Same.

374
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,660
Right.

375
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,780
You shot all day.

376
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,260
Don't stay up.

377
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,180
Next Wednesday,

378
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,580
I'll be shooting Whim's solo cover.

379
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,060
If I'll do it,

380
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,260
this will really be over.

381
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,820
Otherwise...

382
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,860
Of course you should shoot it.

383
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,860
It's yours to begin with.

384
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,300
Do your best.

385
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,580
Don't let me interfere with your work.

386
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,340
I'll work hard too.

387
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,380
It'll be a fresh start tomorrow.

388
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,740
I'm going to bed then.

389
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,820
Good night.

390
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,460
Good night.

391
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,580
Of course,

392
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,260
things might get busy in the future.

393
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,340
We may not
be able to see each other often.

394
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
But I promise

395
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,940
to update you
as soon as something happens.

396
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,420
Just wait for me,

397
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,780
okay?

398
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,340
Okay.

399
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,620
Sure.

400
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,780
Then let's follow this.

401
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,780
The annual agreement
has been sent back to your legal team.

402
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,300
No problems there either.

403
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,220
Then get it signed right away.

404
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,020
The earlier it's settled,
the less worries.

405
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,060
Never thought

406
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,460
we'd work together again

407
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,420
in this lifetime.

408
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,940
We're all professionals.

409
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,700
Business comes first.

410
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,260
Exactly.

411
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,780
Pleasure working together.

412
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,500
It's over.

413
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,900
Find ways to stall.

414
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,980
I'm about to get in the elevator.

415
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,820
Three minutes max.

416
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,980
Enough talking.

417
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,700
I'm on my way to intercept someone.

418
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,540
Why come to the office today?

419
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,180
Meeting someone?

420
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,620
Of course I'm here for work.

421
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,100
Unlike you.

422
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,860
What do you mean by that?

423
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,580
You know why I'm here?

424
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,420
Don't tell me Jinyuan came for you too?

425
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,580
Or is he here to talk to Ms. Ling?

426
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,100
Yes.

427
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,940
Forcing me to be on the cover.

428
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,220
Cover?

429
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,020
Didn't Jia Fan leave?

430
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,460
I'm still here.

431
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,940
Han Yijing.

432
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,580
How could you do this to Jia Fan?

433
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,500
He just kicked out

434
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,740
and you're already messing with your ex?

435
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,420
Mind your words.

436
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,420
That's the rumor.

437
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,500
Gossip is dangerous.

438
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,180
I'm just warning you.

439
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,420
He's a great man.

440
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
Responsible,

441
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,900
brave, and young.

442
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,460
Much better than Liao Jinyuan.

443
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,060
If I were you, I'd choose him.

444
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
No backtracking.

445
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,140
Told you to mind your words.

446
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,340
I...

447
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,900
Did I speak?

448
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,340
What are you thinking about?

449
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,140
Nothing.

450
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,300
Jinyuan, what a coincidence.

451
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,300
When gossiping about someone,

452
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,700
lower your voice.

453
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,020
Jinyuan!

454
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,340
Have you eaten yet?

455
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,140
I came for lunch.

456
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,300
Why don't we eat together?

457
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,020
You're hungry?

458
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,260
[Lucky Wontons]
Jinyuan.

459
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,980
I didn't mean to talk bad about you.

460
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,020
I truly believe so.

461
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,060
Initially, I also thought

462
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,100
Jia Fan had ulterior motives
for Han Yijing.

463
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,660
But

464
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,220
he gave up such a great opportunity

465
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,580
for her

466
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,380
and defied Ms. Ling

467
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,140
Gosh.

468
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,980
Who could resist such a boyfriend?

469
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,180
So Ms. Ling fired him

470
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,820
for dating Han Yijing?

471
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,780
Obviously.

472
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,580
Jia Fan was her favorite.

473
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,340
She would never fire him

474
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,140
over a magazine cover.

475
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,220
If Ms. Ling finds out you're dating,

476
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,700
she'll eat you alive.

477
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,700
I don't care.

478
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,460
Let her try.

479
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,100
Anyway, no matter what,

480
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,380
I will

481
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,300
never

482
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,660
just leave like someone did

483
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,740
without a word.

484
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,300
I'll never leave her alone.

485
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,860
Jinyuan.

486
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,300
What are you thinking about?

487
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,140
Nothing.

488
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,580
You're right.

489
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,700
He's better than me.

490
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,380
But to me,

491
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,300
no one holds a candle to you.

492
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,700
That's because
you haven't met enough people.

493
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,780
I have.

494
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,540
They can be categorized
into three types.

495
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,060
The first type,

496
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,580
she's a rich kid,

497
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,180
and must be flattered.

498
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,260
The second,

499
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,260
she's a model who can never

500
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,420
surpass Han Yijing.

501
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,740
No brains.

502
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,140
Terrible temper.

503
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,300
Better to avoid her.

504
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,900
Stay as far away as possible.

505
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,700
The third,

506
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,060
she's nobody special,

507
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,780
not worth any attention.

508
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,220
But you're the fourth type.

509
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,540
You're the only one

510
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,580
who can see my strengths.

511
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
All these years,

512
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,740
no matter how I acted,

513
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,420
or how reckless I was,

514
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,100
you always found reasons to forgive,

515
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,420
comfort,

516
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,300
encourage,

517
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,020
and believe in me.

518
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,220
That's because you're capable
to begin with.

519
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,620
Or you'd have quit long ago

520
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
and gone home to be the heiress
that you are.

521
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,220
Shop, party,
and drink afternoon tea every day.

522
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,980
What a great life.

523
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,660
Why struggle alone?

524
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,860
Sticking with ACME

525
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,460
even if you're just a benchwarmer?

526
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,300
Not just for your dream,

527
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,300
but also because

528
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,940
you'd miss Han Yijing,

529
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,580
Xing Mo,

530
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,020
and even Ms. Ling.

531
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
What are you

532
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,380
saying it out loud?

533
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,580
But I still let you down.

534
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,420
Things keep getting worse.

535
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,220
I squandered a winning hand.

536
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,820
If this goes on,

537
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,900
it won't be long

538
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,820
before I end up being kicked out

539
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,140
by Ms. Ling, like Jia Fan.

540
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,660
Then find a way out yourself.

541
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,340
Change your style as soon as you can.

542
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,180
Change?

543
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,900
Yes.

544
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,260
If one path is blocked, try another.

545
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,500
All roads lead to Rome.

546
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,620
That's how I made it.

547
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,980
Jia Fan too.

548
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,340
We dared to try.

549
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,260
What's there to fear?

550
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,380
Sir, a Coke Zero.

551
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,340
Iced.

552
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,460
Got it.

553
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,740
Bad for your stomach. Eat first.

554
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,060
Just a small show. It'll be no problem.

555
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,540
Oh right.

556
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,100
Don't say I told you.

557
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,100
Don't be late.

558
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,980
Next, Jia Fan.

559
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,700
Oh wait...

560
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Is Jia Ruozhen here?

561
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,780
Yes!

562
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,660
Follow me.

563
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
Next.

564
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Next.

565
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,220
[Interview Room]

566
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,740
Hello?

567
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,820
How much longer will it be?

568
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,700
I've been waiting here...

569
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,340
You are?

570
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,740
Jia Fan.

571
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,140
Sorry,

572
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,900
