00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,820
Not necessarily.

192
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,420
Learning isn't just for the competition,

193
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,380
but for a better self.

194
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,660
Whether you can become a better self

195
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,500
comes down to today.

196
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,860
Nervous?

197
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,300
What are you talking about?

198
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,580
Well,

199
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,300
everyone calls me

200
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,540
Jia the Confident.

201
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,620
Yijing.

202
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,700
Linda, let me see the list.

203
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,180
Notify those who are on it.

204
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,220
Yijing, why are you here?

205
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,580
Has the list been posted?

206
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:30,980
Not yet.

207
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,020
There's an issue
with the official website.

208
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,100
We're notifying everyone now.

209
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,940
Let me see it.

210
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm supposed to
teach the lessons on fashion, right?

211
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,660
I want to get to know them in advance

212
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,500
so I can tailor my teaching methods.

213
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,700
Ms. Han, you're so thoughtful.

214
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,020
Thank you for your hard work.

215
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,570
[Liu Jia, Kong Ernuo, Zhou Lu,
Tian Chu, Song Chuan]

216
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,860
You're really Jia the Confident.

217
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,140
What's wrong?

218
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,820
Didn't make it?

219
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,340
I can't come in this Sunday.

220
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,820
Why?

221
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,340
Oh right.

222
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,260
Your dad went to the hospital today.

223
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
Is something...?

224
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,380
Mr. Jia Fan.

225
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,060
Please report to the following address

226
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,340
at 10 AM on July 6th

227
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,940
with your ID.

228
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,860
Fangyuan Building, ACME.

229
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,220
Are you crazy?

230
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,380
Crazy or won the lottery?

231
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,260
Mom.

232
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,260
Better than winning the lottery.

233
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,900
We made it!

234
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,500
You found a job?

235
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,060
Not me, it's Fan.

236
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,860
Actually, it's me.

237
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,180
You're in luck today, old man.

238
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,420
Today's snakehead is fresh.

239
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,220
Try it right now.

240
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,340
How long were you
planning to hide it from me?

241
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,620
What am I hiding?

242
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,740
I wanted to tell you after I got through

243
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,780
to make you happy.

244
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,300
I went to the hospital today.

245
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,740
Dr. Lin told me everything.

246
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,020
What did he tell you?

247
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,700
You got the results?

248
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,460
Don't listen to him.

249
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,620
I'm fine.

250
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,700
Look,

251
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm quick with my eyes

252
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,860
and hands.

253
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,580
Your diagnosis has been confirmed.

254
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,460
A healthy person
wouldn't keep getting injured.

255
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,580
Do you think I'm actually blind?

256
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,860
Let's not talk about this today, okay?

257
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,580
Your son just won a competition

258
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,020
with only a 10% pass rate.

259
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,740
Stop going.

260
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,140
What are you talking about?

261
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,180
Quit the seafood shop.

262
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,300
Stop doing dangerous things

263
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,620
like using knives

264
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,380
and riding motorcycles.

265
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,060
Go to the hospital as soon as possible.

266
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,620
No way.

267
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,620
You know it can't be cured.

268
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
I can't just sit around

269
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,860
and wait here all day.

270
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,700
I've been prepared for this
since a long time ago.

271
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,980
I had thought it through back then.

272
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,540
If I can't avoid it, I'll live well

273
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,620
and not waste a single day.

274
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,620
People like me
have fewer opportunities to begin with.

275
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,100
This time, I won the competition

276
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,420
on my own merit.

277
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,140
Why won't you

278
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,940
even let me try?

279
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,380
Besides,

280
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,460
it's a chronic disease.

281
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,100
It won't suddenly worsen, right?

282
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,780
I'm only 25.

283
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,460
I'll just be more careful in the future.

284
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,780
Just relax.

285
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,980
Let me do what I want.

286
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,660
Okay?

287
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,060
It's all my fault.

288
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,020
I dragged your mom into this back then

289
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,820
and now you.

290
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,460
Why do you keep bringing her up?

291
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,260
The reason I kept delaying the check-up

292
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,900
was because I was afraid you'd say this.

293
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,660
This retinitis pigmentosa

294
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,700
is a rare disease.

295
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,340
Having surgery will only postpone

296
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,420
the coming of the last stage.

297
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,380
There is no cure for it.

298
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,380
Moreover,

299
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,260
this is a hereditary disease.

300
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,100
And your eyes.

301
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,380
You were acting quite naturally
when you were busy

302
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,420
with your work in the market.

303
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,900
Your eyes looked firm
when you were handling sashimi.

304
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,380
I used to feel that my life

305
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,700
was a tunnel.

306
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,100
Very dark, very long,

307
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,220
and very narrow.

308
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,700
It stayed that way
until one chance came to me.

309
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,100
I stood on a place called "runway".

310
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,220
So I was wondering,

311
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,300
can my life

312
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,020
be like a runway?

313
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,620
It doesn't have to be long,

314
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,580
but there has to be light,

315
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,740
audience,

316
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,420
applause,

317
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,180
and hope.

318
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,700
Preparation for new recruits' training
is already underway.

319
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,540
This year's momentum surpasses
that of previous years,

320
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,180
so every department
is taking it seriously.

321
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
Still can't reach him?

322
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,100
This is the first time
this has happened.

323
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
I'll have someone to check again later.

324
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,460
No need.

325
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,100
What's going on?

326
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,060
You can't force it.

327
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,460
Did you cause trouble again?

328
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,740
What do you mean "again"?

329
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,940
Did you hear what they said?

330
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,140
Them?

331
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,980
They said something?

332
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,220
I don't know.

333
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,100
That guy's missing?

334
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,260
He's not answering his phone.

335
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,500
Did something happen?

336
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,620
Nothing should stop him

337
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,820
from reporting in.

338
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,740
I shouldn't have trusted him
in the first place.

339
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
What a waste of my emotions.

340
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,540
Your dream of getting rich is ruined?

341
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,340
If he really quits,

342
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,780
you'll lose big time.

343
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,660
Why do you

344
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,460
always rub salt
into other people's wounds?

345
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,020
Then I...

346
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,460
Drop me off at the next intersection.

347
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,740
What?

348
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,140
We're not home yet.

349
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,620
I'm going to get a skin treatment.

350
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,220
I should at least drop you off.

351
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,540
Give me the address.

352
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,620
Don't you want to get off work early?

353
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
It's a rare opportunity.

354
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,780
Don't regret it.

355
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,660
[Outpatient]

356
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,060
What did the surgeon say?

357
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,180
Just a slight rib fracture.

358
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,580
No big deal.

359
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,380
I can be discharged anytime.

360
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,180
Sorry.

361
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,780
I didn't know

362
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,820
you were hiding the check-up
from your dad.

363
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,580
He happened to come to the hospital
that day.

364
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,300
It's fine.

365
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,540
He would've found out eventually.

366
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,020
By the way,

367
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,700
in the future,

368
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,620
be careful at night

369
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,580
or going to dark places.

370
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,700
But don't be too nervous.

371
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,820
Although the peripheral retina

372
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,780
has atrophied,

373
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,860
the posterior pole is still okay.

374
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,020
So it doesn't affect work?

375
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,900
Depends on what work you do,

376
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,900
whether it's day or night,

377
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,100
whether it strains your eyes.

378
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,860
Your dad doesn't have it easy either.

379
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,100
At his age,

380
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,260
he can barely take care of himself.

381
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,300
Yet he still has to worry about you.

382
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,820
I think

383
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,100
you should take a break from everything.

384
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,620
Go home and rest.

385
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,380
Let him digest the news too.

386
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,060
Once you're healed

387
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,180
and he has accepted it,

388
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,900
we'll go from there,

389
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,100
okay?

390
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,300
Sure.

391
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,820
Blood pressure, lipid levels,

392
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,060
and thyroid levels are all normal.

393
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,940
But,

so much in the future.

You saw it yourself.

396
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,820
The fluid we drained

397
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,220
was almost over 100 ml.

398
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,980
Got it.

399
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,820
Can you not wear the white coat?

three years ago,

Why didn't you answer my calls?

that if you don't report in

442
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,020

443
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,460

I thought it was something amazing.

446

But even a rookie like me

447

can easily make it in.

448
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,780
It's not that impressive after all.

449
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,820
How boring.

to prove to those who looked down on me

457

that I could.

You're right.

is a fleeting and turbulent career.

00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,100
Are you messing with me?

565
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,500
Fan.

566
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,220
Did something happen?

567
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,700
Come out and explain.

568
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,420
We can solve it together.

569
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,940
Do you hear me?

570
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,860
Back then, you said

571
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,940
you didn't want to deal with fish
your whole life.

572
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,900
You wanted to give it a try.

573
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,500
You also said you wouldn't let me down.

574
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,220
We worked so hard,

575
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,700
gave it our all,

576
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,740
and finally made it.

577
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,780
We put in so much effort.

578
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,820
You're actually going

579
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,300
to give up now?

580
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,820
I was counting on you to join ACME

581
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,500
so I could become a stylist.

582
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,500
Stupid Jia Fan.

583
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,100
Forget it.

584
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,260
Do whatever you want.

585
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,860
I only have myself to blame.

586
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,300
I shouldn't have listened to you

587
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,740
or gotten involved.

588
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,580
Listen.

589
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,300
Whether you work at the shop or not
is up to you.

590
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,380
But if you don't go to
the new recruits' training,

591
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,420
we're so done!

592
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,020
From now on,

593
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,740
we'll go our separate ways

594
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,260
and never see each other again!

595
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,660
Uncle Jia.

596
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,140
I'm leaving.

597
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,460
Xiaoru.

598
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Don't be mad at him.

599
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,260
Uncle, he just said that
in the heat of the moment, right?

600
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,700
Uncle.

601
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,580
Actually, he chose modeling
over being a chef

602
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,820
not just for himself,

603
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,780
but for you as well.

604
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,260
Talk to him.

605
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,700
He'll listen to you.

606
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,660
Fan.

607
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,820
I left some seafood congee
in the pot for you.

608
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,980
Come out and have some.

609
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,380
Later.

610
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,300
