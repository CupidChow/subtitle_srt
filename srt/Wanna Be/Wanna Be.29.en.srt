00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,520
Shall I get you a taxi?

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,600
No need. I'll go see someone.

There you are. Perfect timing.

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,400
The noodles were just served.

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,590
They're still hot.

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Pretty,

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,070
it's been five minutes.

15
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,150
New noodles for you.

16
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,510
I... I didn't order them.

17
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,710
You've got the wrong person.

18
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,560
Thanks.

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,350
You asked for new noodles
every five minutes.

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,840
You're so dressed up.

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
Have a date later?

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,120
No.

23

It's the first time you've asked me out.

24

It is?

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,560
It's just a quick lunch.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,910
We haven't seen for a while.

27
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm too embarrassed to see you.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've been taking acting classes.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
I had auditions too.

I had planned to see you

31

after getting my first role.

32
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,150
It would give me a boost.

33

Unexpectedly...

34
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,870
How about you wait

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,430
to win your first prize?

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,080
Then, you...

If you don't want to see me,
just say it.

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,080
So, it doesn't inspire you enough.

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
That's not the problem.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,910
The problem is my ability.

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,190

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,960
Why are you going there?

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
To be the editor-in-chief there?

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

because I bother you too much?

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,310
If so, I wouldn't be here to see you.

59
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,430

Even if I can't be your girlfriend,

Think of your poor aesthetic.

Instead of encouraging me,

125
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,430
you tamped down my enthusiasm.

126
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,830
Look at Uncle Jia.

Then go abroad and work.

193
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,510
Whatever you do,

194

[Harmonious Family]
I won't interfere.

195
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm saying this one last time.

196
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,750
You'll have the operation.

197
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,070
No one can replace you.

198
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,430
Then cancel the operation!

199
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,390
I won't go!

200
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,510
Are you insane?

201
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,040
That doctor is hard to get!

202
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,430
A lot of people helped!

203
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,870
That's why I want you to have it!

204
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,390
I'm old enough.

205
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,510
I don't care if I can see.

206
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,630
But you're in your twenties, right?

207
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,510
People care for you

208
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,750
and you have things to do.

209
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,960
You want me to have the operation?

210
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
You must be insane!

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,670
You can be cured. So can I.

212
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,870
Who can guarantee that?

213

What if you can't?

214
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm only in my twenties.

215
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,670
That's what I thought
when I was your age.

Don't be stubborn!

Shut up! You shut up!

218
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,320
I gave you a genetic disease.

219
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,720
And I'll have the operation.

220
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,510
Tell me.

What kind of father is that?

Listen.

Unless you're cured,

I'm not going abroad.

225
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll keep working in the seafood shop

226

227

I'll always stay with you.

I dare you to say it again!

231

Look at you.

If you can hit me,

233
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,620
I'll go abroad.

234

Try me, then.

do what I tell you to!

You little brat.

Is that true?

245
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,020
When did it happen?

246
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,860
Is it why you used to fall?

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,180
I recommended you
to be a styling assistant at ACME.

250

They'll call you in a day or two.

251
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
What did the doctor say?

252
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,140
Can you be cured?

253
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,580
It's not incurable.

254
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,300
You should have told me earlier.

255
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Then I would be nicer to you.

256
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,580
You've been nice enough to me.

257
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,700

Don't worry.

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,500
I'll let you know when I succeed.

310
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,940
Okay.

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,660
Han,

312
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,620
I invited you over

313
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,580
because I wanted

314
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,580
to say sorry

315
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,500
as Jia Fan's father.

316
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,060
You know very well

317
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
about our family.

318
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm Jia Fan's burden.

319
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,340
Because of me, he's had a hard time.

320

Even you...

321
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,420
You suffered, too.

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,700
That's right.

323
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,660
I've always been worried.

324
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,940
What if you get hurt?

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,740
What if you have an accident?

326
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,860
It tortures me, indeed.

327
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,180
Uncle Jia,

328
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,220
since you know I worry about Jia Fan,

329
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,300
don't you know

330
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
he also worries about you?

331
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,660
When I worry about him,

332
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,060
I know what to do.

333
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,420
But when he worries about you,

334
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,780
I can't do anything.

335
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm just stuck being anxious.

336
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,100
So, if you really want to apologize,

337
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,900
have the operation.

338
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,780

because I wanted you to persuade him.

341
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,060
Then you get the wrong person.

342
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,580
He became a model for you.

343
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,620
He's been working so hard

Now is your chance.

347
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,260
But you reject it

348
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,100
just because you feel guilty.

349
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,260
What about him?

350
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,780
How can he accept that without guilt?

351
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,780
Then what is the point

352
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,180
of his hard work?

353
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,620
Sorry for this, Uncle Jia.

stop hesitating.

Don't you want to see

When something's taken away,

362
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,700
something else will be given.

363
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,980
My son suffered so much with me...

364
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,700
just to meet you.

365
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,380
I agree.

366
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,500
So,

367
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,420
have the operation soon.

368
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,060
When you can see again,

369
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,300

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,700
He has my taste.

Don't eat too much takeout food.

382
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,900
It's not healthy.

383
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,140
Then...

384
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,220
Shall we eat together?

385
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Okay.

386
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,940
In your place or mine?

387
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,900
Mine.

388
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,220
It's near.

389
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,060
Let's go.

390
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,260
You didn't drive, either?

391
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,300
I was walking around.

392
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,340
My car is restricted today.

393
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,980
So, I thought

394
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,060
I could take a walk.

395
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,740
It's eco-friendly.

396
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,060
I told you not to buy so many things.

It doesn't matter.

400
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,340
The bread and sausage

401
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,500
aren't nutritious at all.

402
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700

403
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,900
Pickles and instant noodles are sold.

404

405

406

407
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,260
Keep your mouth shut.

408
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Don't tell him everything.

409
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,820
Or he'll be angry.

411

You must not tell Fan about this.

412

Move on.

413

If you can see,
you won't be so embarrassed.

416

Leave it to me.

417

What did you do?

422

It tastes great.

423

Will you run a restaurant

424
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,540
and be a chef?

425
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,140
A bad joke, huh?

426
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,540
Thank you...

427

Especially for me.

430
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,500
All these years...

431
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,380
you've done a lot for me.

432
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,460
I know everything.

433
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,140
Because we're the same.

434
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
Our bark is worse than our bite.

435
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,540
We sacrifice everything for pride.

436
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,700
In front of our families,

437
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,780
we have to be strong.

438
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,100
So, we're tired.

439
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,540

441

We should at least try.

Compared to my eyes,

456
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,180
your apologies make me feel worse.

457
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Fine.

but I still had you.

460
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,700
Or who'd take care of me when I was old?

461
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,860
Yeah.

462
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,340

of my cooking skills

487
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,140
