Modeling,

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,620
a familiar yet mysterious profession.

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,060
Everyone knows about it,

5
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,340
but few truly understand it.

00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,660
Height and good proportions

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,660

00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,860
Sure, I was born with some advantages,

10

12

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,500
it's just a job.

doesn't guarantee tomorrow's.

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,020
Thank you.

194
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,380
Thank you for helping me.

195
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,220
And,

196
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,820
sorry.

197
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,500
A nuisance like me,

198
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,780
who's sharp-tongued and ungrateful,

199
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,980
brings bad luck to anyone
who gets involved.

200
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
So, I'll say it again.

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,260
Let's not see each other again.

202
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,100
The doctor said
if your knee hurts again,

203
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,020
take this medication on schedule.

204
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,260
Also,

205
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,420
there's a speed bump ahead.

206
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,140
Slow down.

207
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,260
Look into that boy

208
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,900
who fell on stage today.

209
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,780
His background,

210
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,100
personal history,

211
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
and contact info.

212
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,300
Why didn't you attend the party?

213
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,620
The brand designers

214
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,540
and media were all there,

215
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,180
but you didn't even show your face.

216
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,540
Do you think you have the right
to be a poser,

217
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,820
or are you planning to retire

218
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,820
and give newcomers a chance?

219
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,980
I just don't have any interest.

220
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,580
Work is work,

221
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,540
not about interest.

222
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,620
You're a veteran and the face

223
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,420
of ACME,
[*ACME model management]

224
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,060
so I'm obliged to remind you.

225
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,100
If the old guard gets washed up,

226
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,900
it's their own fault,

227
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
not the newcomers'.

228
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,860
If you're okay with that,

229
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,820
then fine.

230
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,100
Just spend the rest of your life

231
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,780
running this bar.

232
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,980
But you should let me know,

233
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,500
so I don't waste my time.

234
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,940
Ms. Ling.

235
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,220
Since you're done,

236
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
how about letting me say something?

237
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,460
Go ahead.

238
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,420
You didn't come all the way out here

239
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,460
just to track down You Ning.

240
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
And it's not just to remind me either.

241
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,940
You could've handled it
with a phone call.

242
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,580
No need for the personal visit.

243
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,500
Come on in.

244
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,780
Have a drink.

245
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,900
If you find me annoying,

246
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,420
I'll disappear.

247
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,260
No need.

248
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,540
Everyone says

249
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,180
modeling is a young person's game,

250
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,460
that once you hit a certain age,
you step aside.

251
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,420
You said you didn't believe that,

252
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,140
that you'd stick to it till you're 80.

253
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,780
You said it.

254
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,580
I hope you mean it.

255
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,580
Less salt, just a pinch.

256
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,620
Why are you cooking again?

257
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,180
I said I'd do it when I got back.

258
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,100
It's an induction cooker. It's fine.

259
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,820
I can't see clearly,

260
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,900
but I'm not blind.

261
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,020
Then take a good look.

262
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,820
Does your son look handsome today?

263
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,460
What's this sticky stuff?

264
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
It's makeup.

265
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,940
I left it on

266
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,940
so you could see.

267
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,700
Handsome, right?

268
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,460
Yes.

269
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,940
Gosh, you're starving.

270
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,700
Don't they provide food there?

271
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,100
They do.

272
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,220
I just don't like it.

273
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,700
How can anything out there
compare to your cooking?

274
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,580
Exactly.

275
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,660
Nothing compares to mine.

276
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,660
Dad, let me tell you.

277
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,460
You won't believe it.

278
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,220
I just walked a few steps

279
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,620
on that stage today,

280
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,860
and I got

281
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,900
thunderous applause.

282
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,100
Are you sure?

283
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,460
Maybe they were laughing
at you for tripping.

284
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,660
My big-mouthed brother.

285
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,020
No way.

286
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,020
My son is tall, handsome,

287
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,660
with perfect proportions,

288
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,140
and a very classy style.

289
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,580
Takes after me. What can I say?

290
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,980
Then it must be your fault.

291
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,420
The genes came through too strong.

292
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,980
So likable.

293
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,060
So, people like us

294
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,380
are destined to suffer in other ways.

295
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,100
Right?

296
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,740
It's impossible to have
all the good things.

297
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,900
Fate is fair.

298
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,540
Yeah.

299
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,620
Did you go to the hospital?

300
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,380
Why would I go there?

301
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,860
To set my mind at ease...

302
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,940
It's fine.

303
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,580
Don't worry.

304
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,380
Your son is like the Monkey King,

305
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,180
with penetrating insight.

306
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,260
Dig in.

Okay, alright.

Are you done yet?

Done.

I'm exhausted.

and still complaining?

Why?

Alright, fine.

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,500
Come with me.

382
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,700
Ms. Ling.

383
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,580
Take these and distribute them.

384
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,420
Everyone's been working hard
for over a month.

385
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,900
Just replenish some protein.

386
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,540
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

387
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,980
Aren't you going to check it?

388
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,580
How much?

389
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
It's 3,280 yuan.

390
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,100
Just scan the code.

391
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,700
Thanks for coming all this way.

392
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,940
It's okay. Thank you.

393
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,420
Have a seat.

394
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,980
Don't recognize me?

395
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,220
If I hadn't returned your shoe that day,

396
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,020
things could've been hard for you, huh?

397
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,700
I remember now.

398
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,300
Sorry about that.

399
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,900
The lighting was bad,

400
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,540
so I didn't recognize you.

401
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,620
No worries.

402
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,860
Better late than never.

403
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,500
So,

404
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,420
you ordered delivery

405
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
not for the fish fillets,

406
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,900
but to see me?

407
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,860
You could say that.

408
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,100
But don't worry.

409
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,420
I'm not here to settle any scores.

410
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,980
I just wanted to confirm

411
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,940
if you really deliver
for a seafood shop.

412
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,100
Of course not.

413
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm at least a minor shareholder.

414
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,060
Besides deliveries,

415
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,100
I handle slicing

416
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,460
and sourcing too.

417
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,980
Guess that's none of your concern.

418
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,100
You're so young.

419
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,700
Haven't you thought
about exploring the world?

420
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,380
None of your concern either.

421
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,020
Just curious.

422
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,260
That day,

423
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,900
even experienced professional models

424
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,740
would've struggled to stay calm

425
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,380
in such a short time.

426
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,780
Especially since it was your first time.

427
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,340
I didn't think too much about it.

428
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,220
Once the mistake happened,

429
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,620
I just went with what felt natural.

430
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,940
Didn't expect it to turn out well.

431
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,860
Do you still remember that feeling?

432
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,260
Wearing a designer's creation,

433
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,340
standing under the spotlight,

434
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,100
walking towards the audience,

435
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,900
with everyone's eyes on you,

436
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,980
only you.

437
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,860
It was okay.

438
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,180
I've always been the center of attention
in our market.

439
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,380
I'm used to it.

440
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,740
Alright.

441
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,060
Then that's it for now.

442
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,260
Thank you.

443
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,100
You can go now.

444
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,260
Oh, if you like the food,
remember to reorder.

445
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,500
I'll give you a 20% discount.

446
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,540
Ms. Ling,

447
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,660
who was that man...?

448
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,260
Let him join the audition.

449
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,060
Got it.

450
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,520
[The 7th Billion Light
Model Competition]

451
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,140
Interested in giving it a try?

452
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,260
Give it a shot.

453
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,700
You've already made an appearance.

454
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,700
So, you're quite experienced.

455
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,540
What kind of experience is that?

456
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,820
More like an accident.

457
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,860
Just muddling through.

458
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,020
Natalia Vodianova from Russia

459
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,500
was cast while selling fruit

460
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,460
in a small town

461
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,660
and became a world-class supermodel.

462
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,940
Mark Vanderloo from the Netherlands

463
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,580
was scouted while accompanying
his model girlfriend

464
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,540
to an audition

465
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,780
and became one of the world's
sexiest top ten male models.

466
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,340
So why can't we have an ordinary guy

467
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,380
who ran an errand for a friend

468
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,420
and ended up on the runway

469
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,260
by accident?

470
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,100
True.

471
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,940
Um, I want to ask you something.

472
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,180
Of course, go ahead.

473
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,180
Where is the restroom?

474
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,300
I really need to go urgently.

475
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,380
Straight ahead, and then left.

476
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,780
Okay, thank you.

477
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
This kid

478
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,740
is a tough nut to crack.

479
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,700
Seems like everyone's got
their eyes on you.

480
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,900
Are you really that charming?

481
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,900
Oh, you.

482
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,420
You're such a handful.

483
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,340
Mr. Xing.

484
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,660
Don't you recognize me?

485
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,340
That day at the show.

486
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,500
The thong.

487
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,980
What are you doing here?

488
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,380
Who knows.

489
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,620
Ms. Ling ordered a bunch of delivery

490
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,780
just to see me.

491
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,900
And then some guy just now

492
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,100
was talking

493
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,300
about me joining a modeling competition.

494
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,380
It's got to be a joke.

495
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,660
Look at me,

496
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,380
wearing ripped jeans
and a T-shirt all year round.

497
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,220
I'm not even remotely related
to your industry.

498
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,340
What are you doing here?

499
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,100
Another old acquaintance.

500
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,140
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

501
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,660
I'm here for work.

502
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,220
Why? Not a coincidence.

503
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,260
Work?

504
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,620
What kind of work?

505
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,100
Do I need to report to you?

506
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
You're not my boss.

507
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,620
Bye. Don't bother seeing me off.

508
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,740
Name your price.

509
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,100
How much do you want?

510
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,460
Since you're here, drop the act.

511
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
I've seen plenty of people

512
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,260
like you.

513
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,820
What kind of person am I?

514
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,660
The kind who uses work
to get close to us.

515
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
When we run into trouble,

516
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,300
you swoop in like a hero,

517
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,340
earn our trust,

518
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,100
and then act like a friend,

519
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,500
trying every way to please us.

520
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,820
Finally, you exploit our weaknesses,

521
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,860
demanding money or opportunities.

522
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,980
Without exception.

523
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Do you have a persecution complex
or something?

524
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,260
First of all,

525
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,780
I helped you purely out of kindness.

526
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,860
It had nothing to do with who you are.

527
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,620
And, your scandals
are all over the internet.

528
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,020
I don't even need to threaten you.

529
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,940
Lastly,

530
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,580
with the little charm you've got,

531
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,380
you're not worth all the trouble.

532
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,580
I have no charm?

533
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,340
I'm not worth it?

534
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,980
Warrior? Role model?

535
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,740
Isn't all that just hype
from your company?

536
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,340
Go to our food market

537
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,860
and see how many people
recognize you.

538
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,380
So wake up.

539
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,620
I remember you saying

540
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,460
we'd never see each other again.

541
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,500
And you remember this.

542
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,940
I despise women who are sharp-tongued

543
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,660
bad-tempered,

544
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,580
mean,

545
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,340
and ungrateful.

546
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,940
Today, I'll add one more thing,

547
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,060
overly narcissistic.

548
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,140
I got hung up on.

549
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,420
Oh no, this is bad.

550
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,140
Where's You Ning the drama queen?

551
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,260
No idea. Haven't seen her.

552
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,580
Yijing.

553
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,180
Wait, where have you been?

554
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
I called you, but you didn't answer.

555
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,380
Went to see off a friend.

556
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,020
What's up?

557
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,700
You don't know yet?

558
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,740
Know what?

559
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,460
That curly-haired guy from yesterday.

560
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,900
Heard Ms. Ling asked him
to join this year's audition.

561
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,460
She even invited him to the company.

562
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,620
He just left.

563
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,220
Did she seem unhappy?

564
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,940
More than unhappy.

565
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,780
Furious.

566
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,860
Why?

567
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,060
Did somebody offend her?

568
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,140
When?

569
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,780
What is wrong with you?

570
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,700
Are you insane?

571
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,340
Are you having a death wish?

572
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,860
You're just...

573
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,820
a slimeball.

574
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,860
You live...

575
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,700
Get lost!

576
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Sorry.

577
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,140
I was a bit impulsive

578
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
and rude.

579
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,700
But I couldn't sleep if I didn't say it.

580
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,620
Be safe.

581
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,740
Take it slow on the road.

582
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,140
Crazy woman.

583
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,180
Crazy woman!

584
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,940
What's the matter?

585
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,620
Heard you asked Jia Fan
to join the audition.

586
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,020
You're well-informed.

587
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,820
Why?

588
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,860
I already said he's just
a one-time fill-in.

589
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,300
Doesn't matter.

590
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
As long as he can win.

591
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,380
No way.

592
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,180
He's like a blank slate.

593
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,820
No charisma, no experience.

594
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,460
Just a little clever.

595
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,340
No real adaptability.

596
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,580
That doesn't mean

597
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,140
he shouldn't even qualify, right?

598
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,340
Is there another reason?

599
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,020
Or you wouldn't make
such a big deal out of it,

600
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,140
coming here to ask me.

601
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,020
As the organizer, ACME

602
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,140
shouldn't ruin its reputation.

603
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,780
Participants must be professional,

604
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
at a minimum.

605
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,060
Compared to professionalism,

606
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,020
personal charisma matters more.

607
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,620
These days, the market

608
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,380
is flooded

609
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
with overly self-absorbed,

610
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,540
attention-seeking narcissists.

611
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,140
People are tired of them.

612
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,940
But Jia Fan is different.

613
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,580
He's simple and pure,

614
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,700
without any ulterior motives.

615
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,780
He's even a bit raw.

616
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,940
There is a freshness to him.

617
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,500
There are plenty of people like that.

618
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,940
But he lost his mother at a young age

619
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,100
and had to drop out of college

620
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,540
to take care of his blind father,

621
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,300
working at a seafood shop

622
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,260
to support his family.

623
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,300
That kind of inspiring story

624
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,460
isn't something just anyone has.

625
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,620
So

626
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
no matter what anyone says,

627
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,420
the market decides.

628
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,220
Dad.

629
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,460
Aren't you coming back yet?

630
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,740
Soon.

631
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,980
Have you had dinner?

632
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,700
Mom always

633
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,660
wanted to be a model, right?

634
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,660
Yeah.

635
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,500
With her looks,

636
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,180
she was born to be a model.

637
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,220
Then why didn't she ever try?

638
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,540
Everyone has dreams.

639
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,820
But not everyone gets the chance.

640
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,940
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

641
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,060
Alright.

642
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,580
Never mind.

643
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,700
You should get some rest.

644
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,340
Be careful on the road.

645
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:27,980
Got it.

646
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,300
Do you still remember that feeling?

647
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,380
Wearing a designer's creation,

648
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,620
standing under the spotlight,

649
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,300
walking towards the audience,

650
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,980
with everyone's eyes on you,

651
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,220
only you.

652
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,780
So why can't we have an ordinary guy

653
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
who ran an errand for a friend

654
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,860
and ended up on the runway

655
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,740
by accident?

656
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
With your talent,

657
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,180
it'll take you at most four years.

658
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,300
Once you pass the assessment,

659
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,660
you'll become the youngest

660
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,660
and most skilled head chef in our group.

661
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,220
Miss this, and you'll never
get another chance.

662
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,340
Everyone has dreams.

663
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
But not everyone gets the chance.

664
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,260
People who get a chance
to walk the runway

665
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,100
and then brag about it on their resumes

666
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,820
are a dime a dozen. So tacky.

667
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,580
I've seen plenty of people like you.

668
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,780
Hope we never see each other again.
