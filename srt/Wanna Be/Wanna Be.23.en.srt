The key person,

383
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,020
Ms. Ling

384
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,820
can hardly smile.

385
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,660
These days I've only seen her twice.

386
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,420
Once in the tea room,

387
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,460
she was staring out the window alone.

388
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,180
Later, in the corridor,

389
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,140
she was stony-faced and deadpan.

390
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,060
I was so scared
that I didn't dare to speak.

391
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,860
Why?

392
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,780
Because the person they are finding
isn't in the ACME.

393
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,620
Then where is he?

394
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,740
Hailiwang.

395
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,140
Me?

396
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,260
It's you.

397
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,500
Fan,

398
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,900
trust me,

399
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,940
it won't take too long

400
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,220
for us to reunite.

401
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,580
Wait and see.

402
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,420
Huh?

403
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,260
You're being subjective.

404
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm not as popular as you make out.

405
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,540
No.

406
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,380
Fan,

407
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,020
even if I tell you,
you may not believe this.

408
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,220
On Friday,

409
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,540
a huge client came to our company,

410
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,980
a well-known Spanish designer.

411
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,820
I forgot his name.

412
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,620
Anyway,

413
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,500
Ms. Ling got dressed up

414
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,300
and waited at the company early

415
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,700
to welcome him personally.

416
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,460
Hello!

417
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,620
Hello!

418
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,580
I'm Han Jialing.

419
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,460
Nice to meet you.

420
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,820
Welcome to my company.

421
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,740
I have heard a lot about you.

422
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,380
But it's better to see you here.

423
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
I'm grateful.

424
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,060
These two are my staff.

425
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,260
They are going to be with us.

426
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,140
You can ask

427
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,420
if you have any questions.

428
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,980
Okay, thank you very much.

429
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
This way, please.

430
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,940
These are just small parts.

431
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,620
They are relatively mature and famous.

432
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,820
And most of them
are in the roster of models,

433
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,180
including the newcomers
who have been selected

434
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,940
in the Top Line this year.

435
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,740
He is that model.

436
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,580
He is Mo Xing, our top model.

437
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,740
He has done very well
on the major shows.

438
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,260
I have sent you his information before.

439
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,740
I believe he fits.

440
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,500
I know a lot about Xing Mo.

441
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,740
And I focus on him for years.

442
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,300
He is professional and excellent.

443
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,820
He is really a good model.

444
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,060
But just because I know too much
about him.

445
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,420
There is no room for imagination.

446
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,220
It's a pity.

447
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,140
What about this one named Jia Fan?

448
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,220
He is also on your roster.

449
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,900
He just asked.

450
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,860
Yes.

451
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,940
The roster is in the meeting room.

452
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,460
This way, please.

453
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,940
Yes.

454
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,740
Go take a look.

455
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,900
[Jia Fan]

456
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,260
What are they talking about?

457
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,940
I don't know.

458
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,420
But he mentioned Jia Fan three times.

459
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,100
So persistent.

460
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,980
He must have done the survey.

461
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,580
He came for Jia Fan.

462
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,660
Ms. Ling,

463
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,580
Mr. Panio takes this new product launch

464
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,380
very seriously.

465
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,620
It took him more than three years
to prepare.

466
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,940
And so far it's

467
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,900
the most satisfying work of him.

468
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,140
So he still hopes to...

469
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,700
You can meet Jia Fan anytime you like.

470
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,700
I'll arrange it.

471
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,180
Turn.

472
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,780
Really?

473
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,940
It's like you are on the spot.

474
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,980
Really.

475
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,900
Someone on the spot told me.

476
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,020
Not Mr. Wu.

477
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,260
It's Hai from the commerce team.

478
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,620
Good job.

479
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,500
You are a social butterfly.

480
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,460
So Fan will be back soon?

481
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,780
Assuming nothing goes wrong,

482
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,100
there is a 99 percent probability.

483
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,980
Fan.

484
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,380
Why did you say this early?

485
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,660
You asked us to back it up,

486
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,780
and made such a mess.

487
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,580
Come on. Have some water.

488
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,780
Thank you.

489
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,260
You're welcome.

490
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,140
If you finish this bottle of water,

491
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,820
there's more over there.

492
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,340
Help yourselves to refill.

493
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,420
Thank you, madam.

494
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,940
Wait.

495
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,820
Don't tell anyone about this

496
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,140
until Fan is back on the team.

497
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,780
Just in case.

498
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,700
Yes.

499
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,060
Especially don't let Ms. Ling know.

500
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,740
Yes.

501
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,300
Make sure this deal goes through.

502
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,620
Otherwise, when it happens, it would be

503
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,420
so embarrassing and humiliating.

504
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,260
So,

505
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,700
successful people

506
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,100
are adaptable.

507
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,940
Fan,

508
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,220
if I were Ms. Ling,

509
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,860
I'd not only ask you to come back,

510
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,540
but I'd personally invite you.

511
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,780
And then,

512
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,540
in front of everyone...

513
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,140
Ms. Ling.

514
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,900
Who's she? The big boss?

515
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,460
Take this punch.

516
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,300
Take this punch.

517
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,380
Take this!

518
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,780
Ling...

519
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,620
Ms. Ling.

520
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,340
Are you busy now?

521
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,020
Let's talk.

522
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,580
I was praising her just now, wasn't I?

523
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
You have waited for today so long,
haven't you?

524
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,100
How do you think about it?

525
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,020
Is it fulfilling?

526
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,860
No,

527
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,220
it's far worse than expected.

528
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,940
To act innocent after benefiting, huh?

529
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,980
Ms. Ling,

530
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,420
I never want to fight against you

531
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,300
or challenge you.

532
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm just...

533
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,580
Just unwilling to accept?

534
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,620
Loving somebody isn't a mistake.

535
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,860
Why can't you two get together?

536
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Because of my eyes.

537
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,820
Since you know it,

538
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,780
why haven't you broken up?

539
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Why are you still trying
to maintain this relationship?

540
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
You should know

541
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,500
her situation.

542
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,300
She grew up without her parents

543
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,980
and suffered a lot with me.

544
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,060
After many difficulties,

545
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,780
now my task can be considered complete.

546
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,300
Now there's only one thing left.

547
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
It's to find someone reliable for her.

548
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,540
I don't care
if he owns a house or a car,

549
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,700
or if he is successful.

550
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,180
But he should be able to

551
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,660
ensure her happiness forever.

552
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,620
I can ensure.

553
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
What do you have to ensure?

554
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,260
The doctor said

555
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,420
my eyes were fine.

556
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,180
At least in the coming decades.

557
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,060
How about the future?

558
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,660
What if it recurs suddenly
in the future?

559
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,140
To have her stay by your side
and take care of you?

560
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,060
Just like what you do for your father?

561
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,100
I can't give her a ticking time bomb.

562
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,140
Right.

563
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,380
It was introduced by Dr. Zhang.

564
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,420
It's all right.

565
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,660
I can wait until he's done.

566
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,620
Right.

567
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,300
Retinitis pigmentosa.

568
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,420
So kind of you.

569
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,140
I would love to
get his email address first.

570
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,260
I'll organize the case in advance
and send it to him

571
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
for further understanding
of the situation.

572
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Thank you. Thank you so much.

573
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,860
Looking forward to the good news.

574
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,540
Bye.

575
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,500
What did that phone call mean?

576
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,420
When did you come?

577
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,220
Why didn't you call me?

578
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,580
You heard all of this, didn't you?

579
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,660
Jia Fan will come back.

580
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,620
Ms. Ling lately has given me
a lot of contact details.

581
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,140
All these are eye specialists
at home and abroad.

582
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,700
I think it's for Jia Fan's father.

583
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
She wants Jia Fan

584
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,460
to focus on work without worries.

585
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,380
Ms. Ling's bark is worse than her bite.

586
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,780
You should be more understanding.

587
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,340
Don't hurt her feelings.

588
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,580
Your fish.

589
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,740
Madam,

590
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,660
would you like to buy some fish?

591
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,220
This fish is great.

592
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,500
This is 15.9 yuan per pound.

593
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,580
Fan.

594
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,340
Give me a second.

595
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,380
Wait for me.

596
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,020
How about it, Fan?

597
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,420
Is it successful?

598
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,460
She still refused?

599
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,060
Impossible.

600
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,180
She came here personally.

601
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,060
Tell us quickly.
When will you come back?

602
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,220
Next Monday.

603
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,540
I told you.

604
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,900
I told you

605
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,740
that there's no problem.

606
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,460
What is it called?

607
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,740
We've finally got everyone together.

608
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,540
Hooray for Ms. Ling!

609
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,060
Great!

610
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
I ask you to come back to ACME.

611
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,180
But that doesn't mean
I agree with your relationship.

612
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,180
Again,

613
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,020
break up with her as soon as possible.

614
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,940
But before you break up with her,

615
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,380
don't let her know about your eyes.

616
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,980
Otherwise, with her personality,

617
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
no matter what reasons you say,

618
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,180
she would never leave you.

619
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
I know

620
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,780
you are sincere to her.

621
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,100
I have also seen your efforts.

622
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,380
But some things are beyond effort.

623
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,740
Just rip the band-aid off.

624
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,100
Do it for her.

625
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,620
You're back.

626
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,460
Did you have supper yet?

627
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,260
I'm waiting for you.

628
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,980
This morning

629
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,740
Yijing asked somebody

630
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,260
to give me these things.

631
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,460
I said no.

632
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,340
But I couldn't refuse no matter what.

633
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,300
This stubborn kid.

634
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,940
Just keep it.

635
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,420
It's her heartfelt gift.

636
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,140
I'm afraid that I can't afford it, Fan.

637
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,660
Does she know

638
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,580
about your eyes?

639
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,020
No.

640
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,820
Then when are you gonna tell her?

641
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,140
At first,
I was worried about making her anxious.

642
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm afraid

643
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,900
she'll stop me

644
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,740
from doing anything,

645
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,300
just like you do.

646
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,260
So I keep putting it off,

647
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,580
until now.

648
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,180
Actually, I'm very conflicted too.

649
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,020
On the one hand,

650
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,260
I'm glad for you and also worried

651
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,420
that you will miss such a good girl.

652
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,180
On the other hand,

653
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,180
I think

654
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,460
we can't be so selfish.

655
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,660
This time,

656
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,300
I can't give you any advice.

657
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,660
As for the problem of love,

658
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,060
you need to deal with it yourself.

659
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,780
But no matter

660
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,420
what decision you make,

661
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,780
I'll support you.

662
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,180
I used to think

663
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,020
that if I could come back to ACME,

664
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,220
and try to prove myself,

665
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,340
I would be recognized.

666
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,460
But I found later

667
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,940
that the biggest problem is myself.

668
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,460
Any efforts are useless.

669
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,780
You asked Wu Ming to find doctors...

670
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,580
for Jia Fan, right?

671
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,180
When did you know?

672
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

673
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,220
The doctors

674
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
have nothing to do with him.

675
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,500
So you stubbornly stop us
from being together,

676
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,420
just afraid that he'll be blind someday.

677
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,700
Hurry back.

678
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,420
It's getting late.

679
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,060
You still don't want to tell the truth.

680
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,180
You still treat me as a fool
like three years ago.

681
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,460
Are you addicted to being a bad woman?

682
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,180
Do you have to keep doing this
until I resent you?

683
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,460
Thank you for finding doctors for him.

684
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,180
I'll pretend to know nothing.

685
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,220
I hope you can keep this secret.

686
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,540
And then I'll do as I see fit.

687
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,340
It's none of your concern.

688
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,820
Hello?

689
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,100
Who is this?

690
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,300
Hello, Ms. Ling.

691
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,340
Good evening.

692
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,420
It's Huang Jinde.

693
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,860
How come you can't even recognize
my voice?

694
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,620
It seems that we haven't spoken
for too long.

695
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,580
What's up?

696
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm giving you a preview.

697
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,940
I have got

698
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,820
some big news

699
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,700
about your niece,

700
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
