If I were you,

I would walk away.

14

Before that, I'd slap him.

You're my role model, indeed.

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,460
But you and I will have time.

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,500
Plenty of time.

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,060
to mess me up, huh?

193
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,100
I'm here to apologize.

194
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,900
Sorry for what happened at the party.

195
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,340
I lost control

196
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,220
and embarrassed you.

197
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,500
Because of this, Ms. Ling

198
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,140
wanted to fire me.

199
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,780
You're half responsible.

200
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,460
If you had told me before,

201
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,260
things wouldn't end up like that.

202
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,500
So, you should forgive me.

203
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,820
Pretend you didn't see me that day.

204
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,020
Okay?

205
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,220
What's so funny?

206
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,460
It has kept me sleepless for days.

207
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,620
What is this?

208
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,540
An apology gift?

209
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,380
Yes.

210
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,820
I bought it for you.

211
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,340
When I arrived this morning,

212
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,140
the noodle shop wasn't open.

213
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,860
I waited for more than an hour.

214
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,500
Did you bring

215
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,540
all their sliced scallions?

216
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Because they're the soul of noodles.

217
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,460
I remember all that you said.

218
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:52,980
Let me do it.

219
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,060
You're as clumsy as before.

220
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,980
The flavor hasn't changed.

221
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,060
Not at all.

222
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,660
You still remember this noodle shop?

223
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,660
Of course.

224
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
This is what I've been missing.

225
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,860
Then do you remember

226
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,220
what I said to you in the noodle shop?

227
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,420
It's okay if you don't.

228
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,380
I'll say it again.

229
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm in love with you.

230
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,420
Like I was six years ago.

231
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,940
Even if you only see me as your sister.

232
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,380
Even if you never missed me

233
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,020
or contacted me when you returned.

234
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,660
I'd never change.

235
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,700
You Ning,

236
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,180
I told you how I felt about you.

237
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,140
You still have feelings for Han Yijing?

238
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,260
Want to get back to her?

239
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,540
She has a boyfriend.

240
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,620
You met him at the party.

241
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,820
Jia Fan, the new model.

242
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,700
You know Han Yijing.

243
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,940
Once she's in love,

244
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,740
she won't give up.

245
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,180
Buy me more noodles next time.

246
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,820
I'll finish them quickly.

247
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,380
Jinyuan, you...

248
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,500
All right.

249
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,540
Apology accepted.

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,060
Now, don't ruin my appetite.

251
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,940
Let me eat in peace, okay?

252
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,500
Fine.

253
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,020
Enjoy the noodles.

254
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I should go.

255
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,020
Take care.

256
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,340
It looks way too fashionable.

257
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,300
Next shop.

258
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,980
Fashion is a cycle.

259
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Many popular items

260
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,980
will become new trends

261
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,500
after a few years.

262
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,420
It makes sense, but...

263
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,060
Don't move.

264
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,620
This one is good.

265
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,460
We'll take it.

266
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,140
He doesn't like to follow suit.

267
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,660
But he likes ordinary rebellion.

268
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,060
Few people are fit for this style.

269
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,660
But...

270
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,860
You're perfect for it.

271
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,380
Today, our mission

272
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,220
is to make you the coolest guy here.

273
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,220
So cool!

274
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Is it necessary?

275
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,020
Morning, everyone.

276
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,140
I'm Jia Fan from ACME.

277
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,860
It's my honor to see you here.

278
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,140
Hi. Take your seat.

279
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,460
Today, you look

280
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,740
quite different from your usual self.

281
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,540
Right.

282
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,460
I'm dressed up for this interview.

283
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,540
I can tell that.

284
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,900
Ordinary guys

285
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,180
won't buy this outfit.

286
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,340
They don't like cheap clothes.

287
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,860
The most expensive item
is worth only 120.

288
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,700
So, you think

289
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,820
our interview

290
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,540
is also worth so little?

291
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,380
I think magazines are just like clothes.

292
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,620
Tastes and attitudes matter most,

293
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
not the prices.

294
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,260
My outfit isn't worth too much.

295
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,420
But it cost me more time and thought

296
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,900
than expensive ready-to-wear clothes.

297
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,340
It proves

298
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,820
how I value this interview.

299
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,820
It can't just be evaluated by money.

300
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,460
Good.

301
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,980
But that's not enough.

302
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,620
You should have advantages.

303
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,300
Being a candidate for your magazine

304
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,580
is my biggest advantage.

305
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,260
Oh.

306
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,380
I heard you worked
at a seafood shop, huh?

307
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,020
I still work there.

308
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,500
Have you thought of quitting?

309
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,460
Not yet.

310
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,460
Why?

311
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,700
Do you think so poorly of your rivals?

312
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,380
Yes.

313
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,820
I never take them as my rivals.

314
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,900
What do you take them as?

315
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,980
Nothing.

316
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,340
I just do what I should do.

317
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,900
I never worry about what I shouldn't do.

318
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,740
And then?

319
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Then they'll stand no chance

320
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
and give up.

321
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,060
Interesting.

322
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,540
Have the audition next door.

323
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,700
You'll be informed
when the result is out.

324
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,620
Okay.

325
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,980
Thank you, everyone.

326
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,100
See you next time.

327
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,100
Oh.

328
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,540
My stylist Ms. Han said,

329
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,340
my greatest strength is...

330
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,580
I'm just like her.

331
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,940
We don't surrender.

332
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,820
Just for your information.

333
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,300
What do you think?

334
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,140
Let's talk.

335
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,820
Any opinions?

336
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,580
I feel he was forced to come

337
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,460
and he was angry.

338
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
He sounded sarcastic.

339
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,140
A new model

340
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,380
shouldn't be so arrogant.

341
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,700
Special, isn't he?

342
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,660
He isn't hypocritical.

343
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,780
And he isn't afraid of offending us.

344
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,420
He's relaxed and rebellious.

345
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,220
Quite distinctive.

346
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,900
Especially his outfit.

347
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,020
I loved it at first sight.

348
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,540
Sadly, he's a new model.

349
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,900
He isn't famous at all.

350
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,020
I think it's a bit risky

351
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,660
to put him on our first cover.

352
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,700
Shall we

353
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,860
put a pair of models on our cover?

354
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,100
Han Yijing.

355
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,340
Good idea.

356
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,540
She's famous enough.

357
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,260
And they're both from ACME.

358
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,940
A senior and a new model

359
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,620
keep with our theme,

360
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,380
passing down.

361
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,500
And they're a couple at the party.

362
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,660
The best of all couples.

363
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,740
That's why I think of them.

364
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
There were so many guests at the party.

365
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,620
But they attracted all eyes.

366
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,180
Perfect match.

367
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,860
Leslie, what do you think?

368
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,820
I hope from now on,

369
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,300
you'll focus on being
the editor-in-chief

370
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,820
and stay out of her way.

371
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
You know Han Yijing.

372
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,820
Once she's in love,

373
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,420
she won't give up.

374
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,660
I just do what I should do.

375
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,140
[Jia Fan]
I never worry about what I shouldn't do.

376
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,140
Your old friend died three years ago.

377
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,060
Don't call me again.

378
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,940
There's nothing left to say.

379
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,540
Come on, a toast to Fan.

380
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,820
Hope he'll find ways to triumph

381
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,180
and be on the first cover.

382
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,060
Cheers!

383
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,100
You two go ahead.

384
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,820
I have to drive.

385
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,060
I'll drive.

386
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,300
You had a long day.

387
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
I'll drive.

388
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Driving won't exhaust me.

389
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,420
If you drive me

390
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,780
and get a taxi back,

391
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,860
it will take an hour.

392
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,220
I can get some sleep in the taxi.

393
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,140
Hey, guys.

394
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,540
Do you forget you can get

395
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,140
a designated driver?

396
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,780
I'll drink it up, then.

397
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,420
Fine.

398
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,700
I'll let you go today.

399
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,940
But let's make a deal.

400
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,980
When the magazine is released,

401
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,340
you must drink with me.

402
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,380
We'll get hammered.

403
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
It won't happen.

404
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,740
Why?

405
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,140
Did you screw it?

406
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,300
No.

407
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,820
Big expectations may disappoint us.

408
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,460
If we don't expect anything,

409
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,380
we may...

410
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,140
Since when are you so modest?

411
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,460
Oh no.

412
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,060
There's no hope, then.

413
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,260
Otherwise, a pompous guy like him

414
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,540
wouldn't say that.

415
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,420
Did he give you a hard time?

416
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,300
Or did you mess with them?

417
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,420
I'm not insane.

418
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,900
The editor-in-chief

419
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,580
gave me this chance.

420
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,660
I would only flatter him.

421
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Why do you sound so jealous?

422
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,420
I felt something wrong last time.

423
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,460
You sound as if you're rivals in love.

424
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,260
Dong Xiaoru.

425
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,260
Last time?

426
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,540
The day after the party.

427
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,780
He kept speaking ill of Liao

428
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,300
and complained about him.

429
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,580
He even competed with him,

430
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,460
saying "I'm taller."

431
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,540
"I'm younger."

432
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,140
"And I have more potential than him."

433
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,700
Xiaoru, stop it, will you?

434
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,660
Then honestly tell us

435
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,540
what happened during the interview.

436
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,340
He majored in computer science

437
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,660
and he was studying very well.

438
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,340
But for no reason,

439
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,540
he dropped out of school.

440
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
These years, he's been working
in the seafood shop

441
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,020
and hasn't got a full-time job.

442
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,940
For his father, I think.

443
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,220
Ask more about him, please.

444
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,020
Okay.

445
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,060
But you need to tell me why.

446
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,700
He'll just be on the cover.

447
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,500
Is it necessary?

448
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,100
Yes.

449
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,220
But it's not about the cover.

450
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,740
Are you sure?

451
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,100
They really complimented you?

452
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,500
So, they must have picked him.

453
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,980
The more they're satisfied,

454
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,140
the less they'll say.

455
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,060
Unless it's claptrap.

456
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,980
But it's okay.

457
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,460
You tried your best.

458
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,900
Yijing,

459
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,540
I've always wanted to ask you something.

460
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,100
Don't ask.

461
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,100
Why are you so nice to Fan?

462
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Why do you help him?

463
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,540
What do you like about him?

464
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,980
Are you kidding?

465
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,420
Isn't it obvious?

466
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,020
Because he's tall,

467
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,060
young,

468
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,540
and promising.

469
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,620
Oh my God.

470
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,300
Dong Xiaoru,

471
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,340
keep your voice down.

472
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,860
We're public figures, after all.

473
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,460
Don't flatter yourself.

474
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,460
You're nobody.

475
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,980
I'm going to the bathroom.

476
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,340
You guys eat.

477
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,100
I'll go home.

478
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,020
I've got a job tomorrow.

479
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,780
Let me drive you.

480
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,660
Don't bother.

481
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,580
Stay with Xiaoru.

482
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
We'll see tomorrow, anyway.

483
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,060
Are you mad at me?

484
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,860
Why do you think so?

485
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,300
Actually, I made everything up.

486
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,700
They didn't compliment me.

487
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,300
They wouldn't be satisfied, either.

488
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm not as generous as I thought I was.

489
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,300
Especially when I think of
what he did to you.

490
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,100
It's okay.

491
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,300
I shouldn't have pushed you.

492
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,140
All right. I'm going home.

493
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,100
Stay safe, then.

494
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,940
You're back.

495
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,140
Why are you still here?

496
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,420
Preparing for your job tomorrow.

497
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,180
Is it...?

498
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,020
What did you just take?

499
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,780
Are you feeling unwell?

500
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,660
No.

501
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,740
Today, I got sunstroke.

502
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,860
I'll be fine soon.

503
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,900
But when you came in here,

504
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,460
you were rubbing your leg.

505
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,500
I hit something in the elevator.

506
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,380
It really hurts.

507
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,620
Oh, I'm going to sleep.

508
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,220
You should go.

509
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,820
Good night.

510
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,540
Do you think Yijing has been weird?

511
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,420
She always moves alone.

512
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,980
She's unpredictable too.

513
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,460
Most importantly,

514
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,020
she hasn't lost her temper for a while.

515
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,380
What are you? A masochist?

516
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,260
Well, it's good for us.

517
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,220
But for her...

518
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Don't tell me

519
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,940
it's because of Liao Jinyuan.

520
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,580
More or less.

521
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,500
Listen, Simin!

522
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,180
Just because you all think like that,

523
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,180
Yijing can't ignore him.

524
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,980
Understand?

525
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Look at me.

526
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,500
I've never brought him up,

527
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,180
right?

528
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,740
I pretend Liao Jinyuan is invisible.

529
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,420
We'll just do what we should do.

530
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,420
We won't give Yijing special attention

531
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,500
or extra treatment.

532
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,420
That's actually good for her. Got it?

533
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,420
It makes sense.

534
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,420
If Liao wants to work with Yijing...

535
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,700
As long as the offer is okay,

536
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,260
I'll approve it immediately.

537
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,500
Forget about that.

538
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,740
I think Yijing has been unwell lately.

539
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Last night,

540
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,580
after I was done packing in her place,

541
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,660
I was about to leave.

542
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,020
At that time, she came back.

543
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,300
Then...

544
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,060
Hello.

545
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,860
Mr. Liu, what's up?

546
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,500
What?

547
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,980
No way!

548
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,940
What a ridiculous idea.

549
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,660
End of discussion. Reject him.

550
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,020
Come on.

551
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,540
From their point of view,

552
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,700
this is understandable.

553
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,580
They think highly of Jia Fan, after all.

554
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,020
Jia Fan is just the guise.

555
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,820
What he actually wants is Han Yijing.

556
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,420
Can't you see?

557
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,300
What we think doesn't matter.

558
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,540
Think about Jia Fan.

559
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,700
Being on Whim's first cover

560
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,060
can be a huge opportunity

561
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,100
for a new model like him.

562
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,620
So is it for ACME.

563
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,260
If it weren't for Liao Jinyuan,

564
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,580
you would agree too, wouldn't you?

565
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,820
So?

566
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,060
So, I want you

567
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,260
to reconsider it.

568
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,100
If...

569
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,740
If we have to reject him,

570
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,140
we should at least have a good excuse.

571
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,380
Or I can't explain it to Jia Fan.

572
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,740
See?

573
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,140
This is what Liao wants.

574
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,460
He'll either get Han Yijing

575
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,740
or make you guys think
I'm unprofessional.

576
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,140
But anyway,

577
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,500
I would rather be unprofessional

578
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,140
than let him boss me around.

579
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,420
You go and explain to Jia Fan.

580
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,700
Never mind the rest.

581
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,500
I'll handle it.

582
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,500
Fine.

583
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,780
Mr. Wu.

584
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,500
Mr. Wu.

585
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,060
Good for you, Fan.

586
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,980
Good news really makes people happy.

587
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
There's no good news.

588
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,660
It's just a formality.

589
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,940
Fan,

590
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,060
don't say that.

591
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,540
You're always the luckiest guy.

592
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,100
Right?

593
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,500
You've always been lucky.

594
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,260
Right?

595
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,380
It doesn't sound right.

596
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,940
Fan is professional.

597
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,260
Good luck has helped a little, though.

598
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,940
That's right.

599
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,780
But don't be sensitive, okay?

600
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,940
My point is...

601
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,260
Fan lost the ad job,

602
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,140
but he got a second chance, huh?

603
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,220
He went to the party

604
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,940
as Ms. Han's date.

605
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,340
That's awesome.

606
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,700
Whim's editors chose him

607
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,260
as a candidate for their cover.

608
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,540
Such a butterfly effect

609
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,100
came from the loss of the ad job, right?

610
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,180
[Do not disturb during training]
I agree.

611
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,780
You're right.

612
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,380
So, Fan,

613
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,700
when will you buy us dinner?

614
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,540
When the training is over.

615
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,700
All of you shall go.

616
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,100
- Okay!
- Great!

617
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,940
Lu.

618
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,060
Lu.

619
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,660
Fan will buy us dinner.

620
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,260
Do you hear?

621
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,740
What's for dinner?

622
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,580
You think about it.

623
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,260
You're all here.

624
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,540
Oh, Jia Fan.

625
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,540
Come to me when the training is over.

626
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,860
It's okay.

627
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,300
You guys go on.

628
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,140
Work hard.

629
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,420
Fine.

630
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,140
The dinner is gone.

631
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,820
We can't eat together.

632
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,820
This studio

633
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,580
covers an area of 3,000 square meters.

634
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,700
It's not huge,

635
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,100
but it has the most and newest equipment

636
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
in this industry.

637
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,220
Now, we have three big studios
and seven small ones.

638
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,900
Besides the photography,

639
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,260
the big studio can hold a hundred guys

640
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,540
for video or ad production.

641
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,460
It offers various services.

642
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,940
It's in high demand, too.

643
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,220
Normally,

644
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,940
it has to be reserved two weeks earlier.

645
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,420
Is there a shoot today?

646
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,460
Yes, in Studio No.1.

647
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,420
Only a few guys, but it's a spectacle.

648
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,180
I'll take a look.

649
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,340
You guys keep walking around.

650
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:42,940
Okay.

651
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,860
Shall we go to Studio No.2?

652
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,340
Okay.

653
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,100
Studio No.2 also covers an area
of 3,000 square meters.

654
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,980
Hey, mop the floor.

655
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,700
Okay.

656
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,620
Have some water.

657
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,500
Here.

658
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,140
I don't want to use the bathroom later.

659
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Water is good for health.

660
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,300
Cameraman,

661
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,100
do it this way.

662
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,780
The left side.

663
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,860
Turn around. Right.

664
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,620
Well done.

665
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,140
All right. Take a break.

666
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,140
Simin.

667
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,980
Simin.

668
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,940
It's over.

669
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,780
Why have you been distracted all day?

670
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,900
Did you see your ex-boyfriend?

671
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,340
No. I was looking for Shubo.

672
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,860
What's for lunch?

673
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,340
We'll go this way.

674
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,020
Check the photos.

675
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,500
I don't need to.

676
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,260
Just take a look.

677
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
He always takes good photos.

678
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,580
It matters a lot to Yijing too.

679
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,380
She's just back in this industry.

680
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,220
She has been on everything

681
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,380
but a cover of a magazine.

682
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,980
And it's Whim's first volume.

683
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,220
Hey, Ming.

684
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,020
How about this?

685
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,020
You talk to Ms. Ling again.

686
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,100
If she's really worried,

687
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,460
she can put me in charge.

688
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,140
I'll watch Liao Jinyuan all the time.

689
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,860
He won't get near Yijing.

690
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,500
Okay?

691
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,020
I...

692
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,580
Ming, I'll hang up.

693
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,420
Help us, please.

694
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,820
It's over, huh?

695
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,620
What's all this about?

696
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,860
Confess.

697
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,180
I heard everything.

698
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,180
It's no big deal.

699
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,260
It's just...

700
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,180
Whim gave an offer.

701
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,460
They want two guys on the cover.

702
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,220
Jia Fan

703
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,140
and you.

704
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,020
Of course, umm...

705
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,860
Ms. Ling was furious upon hearing that.

706
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,300
She firmly disapproved.

707
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,660
I'm afraid Jia Fan

708
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,340
hasn't been told yet.

709
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,140
That's understandable.

710
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,980
If I were Ms. Ling,
I would also disapprove.

711
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,700
Ms. Han,

712
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,220
someone bought you coffee and drinks.

713
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,380
Enjoy them.

714
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,020
Who bought them?

715
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,420
Isn't that obvious?

716
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,780
Either the sponsor or the design team.

717
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,540
Sparkle Orange Juice.

718
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,380
Iced Peach Oolong.

719
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,980
Tea-flavored...

720
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,660
Quite a lot of kinds.

721
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,260
Yijing's favorite drinks.

722
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,500
Wait.

723
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,860
How do they know her favorite drinks?

724
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
So, it's not them.

725
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,300
Then, are they from the fans?

726
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,260
Oh no. Before we figure it out,

727
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
we can't drink any.

728
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,380
Go ask about it.

729
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,340
I'm not going.

730
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,180
Just go. For safety concerns.

731
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,060
It's Liao Jinyuan, I think.

732
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,340
Just now, I saw him.

733
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:38,900
Hey.

734
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,380
Yijing.

735
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,180
- Don't follow me.
- Yijing.

736
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,580
We'll talk on the phone.

737
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,420
Why did you bring him up?

738
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,540
Because you forced me to ask around.

739
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,260
I...

740
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,140
He even came here.

741
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,100
How could I stop him?

742
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,620
It's a small world, indeed.
