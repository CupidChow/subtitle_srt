00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,980
Sometimes, it's more effective
to be direct

3
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,780
than to create diversions.

4
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,420
And they don't have to do it themselves.

5
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,260
Someone else can handle it.

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,420
Speak only for themselves

7
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,780
and focus on the issue only.

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,220
I can't do it alone.

9
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,980
The more people, the better.

10
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,820
And it must be quick.

11
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,820
Within the next couple of days.

12
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,300
It'll be too late
if we miss the discussion.

13
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,260
You handle the media.

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,300
I'll find people.

[One Storm Ends, Another Begins]

16
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,580
Stop.

17
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,580
I added that already.

18
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,220
When?

19
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,980
Right when it went into the pan.

20
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,540
Along with the sugar.

21
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,140
MSG loses its taste
if you add it too early.

22
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,420
It may even get toxic.

23
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,020
Stop making it up.

24
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,700
You're bluffing
because you know I can't cook.

25
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,020
It's true.

26
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,980
You don't even have common sense.

27
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,820
It's the most basic...

28
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,020
Dong Xiaoru!

29
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,940
I'm better than you at cooking.

30
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,340
You're supposed to listen to me.

31
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,940
Oh, you're good at it?

32
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,220
Aren't you learning as you go?

33
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,500
Just like your dear big...

35
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,500
Yijing, you're awake.

36
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,740
Are you cooking?

37
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,220
It's for you.

38
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,620
Congrats on making it through.

39
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,900
A fresh start!

40
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,780
Hurry down.

41
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,020
Try it while it's hot.

42
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,260
You haven't had a proper meal
in three days.

43
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,340
We need to get you nourished. Come down.

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,300
Come on.

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,580

This meal

50
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,820
was made by Jia Fan, right?

51
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,420
You could even tell that?

52
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,580
Thought we could take the credit.

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,820
All right.

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,780
It was Fan

55
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,100
who asked me to come.

56
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,220
He prepared all the ingredients.

57
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,940
He even wrote pages of recipes

58
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,700
and your tastes and preferences.

59
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,700
He's really worried about you.

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,100
And he loves you.

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,620
Without him,

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,020
we wouldn't even feel like cooking here.

63
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,620
Look.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,380
He's been busy for the past three days,

65
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,900
hoping that when you wake up,

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,420
the world will be
entirely different to you.

67
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,020
Luckily, his efforts weren't in vain.

68
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,700
He did it.

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm Jia Fan.

Han Yijing

71
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,620
is my teacher

72
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,260
and also my idol.

73
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,420
She's the most hardworking,

74
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,220
amazing,

75
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,860
and fearless person I know.

76
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,980
If it weren't for her,

77
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,660
I don't think I'd ever be on the runway.

78
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,060
She taught me how to pose for photos

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,220
and cut off my messy hair.

80
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,580
Every time I wanted to give up,

81
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,300
she'd scold me back to my senses.

82
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,100
She kept telling me over and over

83
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,540
how hard this path would be.

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,260
But she also showed me,
time and time again,

85
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,100
that once you have passion,

86
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,420
nothing is too difficult.

87
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,700
She gave me confidence,

88
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,660
turning an ordinary worker like me

89
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,700
into someone brave enough to dream.

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,700
So,

91
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,220
Ms. Han,

92
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,100
you were right.

93
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,100
This path is indeed tough.

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,860
The fact that you've come this far

95
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,580
is already incredible.

96
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,100
I know you have
many regrets in your heart.

97
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,740
But it's okay.

98
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,180
Time will prove to you

99
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,180
what you've gained

100
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,900
is definitely more
than what you've lost.

101
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,900
No matter what the future holds,

102
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,100
you will always be my idol in my heart.

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,700
Always.

104
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,060
Happy graduation.

105
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,140
Because of this video,

106
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,500
more and more people
are speaking up for you,

107
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,380
including the entire ACME.

108
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,140
And me.

109
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,140
I've known Han Yijing for ten years.

110
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,700
No one knows her better than I do.

111
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,860
What they are describing online
isn't her at all.

112
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,980
So stop throwing dirt on her name.

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,220
Because you don't get to.

114
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,620
Han Yijing,

115
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,580
I told you not to push yourself
and you just wouldn't listen.

116
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,820
Look where that got you.

117
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,420
But deep down, I admire you.

118
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,100
You did great.

119
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,460
Happy graduation.

120
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,980
Han Yijing is the hardest-working one

121
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,940
among us.

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
She spent every day
in the practice room.

123
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,020
I would've quit long ago.

124
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,420
That is what makes her an idol.

125
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
She may seem hard to approach,

126
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
but she's actually very down-to-earth.

127
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,980
She's a model, so what?

128
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
Models are human too.

129
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,300
They fall in love and make mistakes.

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
It's completely normal.

131
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,420
Who says a role model has to be perfect?

132
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,740
I think a real role model

133
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,540
is someone who has flaws

134
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,660
yet still shows their best side

135
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,100
to the world.

136
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,500
That's what a true role model is.

137
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,300
Yijing,

138
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,420
happy graduation.

139
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,780
Even though I've left ACME,

140
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,940
the encouragement and help she gave me

141
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,140
is something I'll never forget.

142
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,260
She never spoke about it

143
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,660
because she didn't want
special treatment.

144
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,140
She did it for fairness.

145
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,540
So how did that turn into

146
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,420
deceiving the public?

147
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,060
Yeah.

148
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,980
Exactly.

149
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,380
Being your agent
has been my greatest pride.

150
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,980
I mean it.

151
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,540
I could brag about it for life.

152
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,380
You were the ones who labeled her.

153
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,820
Yet she's the one taking all the blame.

154
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,180
Why should she have to take this?

155
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,980
Yijing, you've worked so hard.

156
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,700
You can finally get some rest.

157
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,860
Happy graduation!

158
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,660
I joined ACME because of Han Yijing.

159
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm a true fan.

160
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,820
Me too.

161
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,860
Even though we won't get to
see her as often,

162
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,220
she'll always be our role model.

163
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,500
We'll keep working hard

164
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,540
not to let you down.

165
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,580
Three, two, one.

166
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
- Ms. Han,
- Ms. Han,

167
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,820
- happy graduation!
- happy graduation!

168
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,020
Hello, Han Yijing.

169
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,060
Do you remember me?

170
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,340
No matter what others say,

171
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,180
I'll always believe in you I see.

172
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,340
You are that kind, brave,

173
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,780
determined, and humble role model.

174
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,100
On behalf of Gusteau Group,
I will always support you.

175
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,060
Happy graduation.

176
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,500
Why is Qu Ruoqing doing this too?

177
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Fan arranged it.

178
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,580
They graduated from the same college.

179
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,500
She does whatever Fan asks.

180
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,900
Does Qu Ruoqing...

181
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,740
like Fan?

182
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,900
Apparently.

183
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,860
A lot of people do.

184
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,740
Four or five in our market.

185
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,380
And his old...

186
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,140
His old what?

187
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
Female customers.

188
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,700
That's why my mom didn't want him to go.

189
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,050
[You Ning]

190
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,420
Simin, is she awake yet?

191
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,900
Why is her phone still off?

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,300
Did she sleep herself to death?

193
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,140
Don't worry. Still alive.

194
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,260
I knew she was in your house.

195
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,060
You're done with sleeping?

196
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Yeah.

197
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
Been online yet?

198
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,180
Seen everything?

199
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,260
Yep.

200
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,340
Why aren't you there?

201
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,580
Seeing me like this,

202
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,780
are you too happy to speak?

203
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,580
Do I look like
that kind of person to you?

204
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,020
I've been too busy

205
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,100
running around for auditions

206
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,700
to have the time for that.

207
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,980
I tried to call you,

208
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,260
but your phone's off.

209
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,380
I see no sincerity in a phone call.

210
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,780
What do you want then?

211
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,100
Me to go over and apologize?

212
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,700
Sure.

213
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,660
Come now.

214
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,740
Where are you going?

215
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,860
Dad, I've got something to do.

216
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,740
I'll be back before dinner.

217
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,780
Wait, come over.

218
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,660
Let me tell you something.

219
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm in a hurry. What is it?

220
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,660
Just come.

221
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,780
Are you going

222
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
to see Han?

223
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,700
She's awake and doing okay.

224
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,900
Okay, that's good.

225
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,620
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

226
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,540
You need to tell her

227
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,380
about your eyes.

228
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,420
Whether she knows it or not

229
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,620
or she has or hasn't heard about it,

230
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,860
you have to tell her in person.

231
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,020
Don't worry, Dad.

232
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,820
I know what to do.

233
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Good.

234
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,380
Go.

235
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,460
Be careful.

236
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,420
Don't fall.

237
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,500
I've got my stick.

238
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,660
How could I...?

239
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,500
Don't jinx me.

240
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,620
- She's there.
- She's there.

241
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,500
Hurry.

242
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,780
- Han Yijing.
- Han Yijing.

243
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,100
Yijing.

244
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,380
- Han Yijing.
- Han Yijing.

245
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,380
Excuse me.

246
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,520
- Han Yijing.
- Yijing.

247
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,260
Han Yijing.

248
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,900
Yijing.

249
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,060
Please talk to us, Han Yijing.

250
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,300
Please take our interview.

251
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,860
Han Yijing.

252
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,740
Han Yijing.

253
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,580
Please.

254
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,300
Please open the door, Han Yijing.

255
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,020
Ms. Han.

256
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,940
Ms. Han.

257
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,900
I didn't know you wanted
to interview me so badly.

258
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,700
Ms. Han.

259
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Happy graduation.

260
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,940
You've got a minute?

261
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,260
Let's chat.

262
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,140
There's nothing to chat about.

263
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,300
Everything, true or false,
is already online.

264
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,980
Then let's talk about what's not there.

265
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,980
Like…

266
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,380
your mother.

267
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,900
If you want to be with her

268
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,140
for the long run,

269
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,900
you can never let this become

270
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,420
a ticking time bomb

271
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,780
buried in your relationship.

272
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,060
Think about what's happening now.

273
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,700
If you had found it out
through the news,

274
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,780
wouldn't you feel awful?

275
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,470
[Something came up. I can't make it.
Don't wait for me.]

276
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,220
Go ahead.

277
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,140
Today,

278
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,940
let's end this once and for all.

279
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,700
So Han Jialing

280
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,060
didn't dare to tell you.

281
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,940
I heard

282
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,300
you've never met your dad.

283
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,180
You grew up with your mother

284
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,420
until you were six years old.

285
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,660
She wanted to go abroad.

286
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,100
And at that time, Han Jialing,

287
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,700
your aunt,

288
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,420
suddenly showed up

289
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,660
and took you in by force.

290
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,220
Enough backstory.

291
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,660
Will you get to the point?

292
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Back then,

293
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,140
your father and your mother

294
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,780
weren't even a couple.

295
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,140
He didn't even know

296
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,300
that you existed as his daughter.

297
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,820
Even if he saw you on TV
or in a magazine,

298
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,820
he would never think
that you, Han Yijing,

299
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,460
were actually his own flesh and blood.

300
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,940
Can you say something I don't know?

301
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,420
Your mom was never at peace with it.

302
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
So she wanted to go abroad
for a fresh start.

303
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,300
But she never thought
about bringing you,

304
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,860
her unwanted burden.

305
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,420
So...

306
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,420
she abandoned you.

307
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,540
She said she was going
on a business trip

308
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,980
and would come back
for you in a few days.

309
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,180
But she never showed up
after more than a month.

310
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,580
No one could reach her.

311
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,700
Everyone at the kindergarten
knew about it.

312
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,900
So...

313
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,220
it's not like Han Jialing
really wanted you.

314
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,540
She just pitied you

315
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,140
and had to make up
for her sister's wrongdoing.

316
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,780
She had no choice

317
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,940
but to raise you.

318
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,140
It's cruel, I know.

319
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,780
But I swear

320
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,020
every word I have said...

321
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,860
Are you done?

322
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,220
Everything you said,

323
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,700
Han Jialing has told me.

324
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,460
Nothing new?

325
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,500
From my birth to now,

326
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
nearly thirty years of my life,

327
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
you've dug up everything, right?

328
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,420
Anything more would be pure fiction

329
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,020
and legally punishable.

330
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,940
This should be the last time we meet.

331
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,500
From now on,

332
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,180
stop holding onto me and my life.

333
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,020
But I have to admit,

334
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,380
you're really suited
for this line of work.

335
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,540
But your drive

336
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,340
could have been used
for something better.

337
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,060
Isn't that Han Yijing?

338
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,820
Looks like it.

339
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,340
Yijing!

340
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,100
Yijing!

341
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,060
Yijing!

342
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,940
Let me go!

343
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
Listen to me.

344
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,180
I'm not leaving.

345
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,580
I'm waiting here for my mom.

346
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,860
Can you just listen to me?

347
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,180
Your mom isn't coming back.

348
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,460
You're lying!

349
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,460
She will.

350
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,220
If I go, she won't know
where to find me.

351
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,820
Yijing.

352
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,860
Listen to me.

353
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,060
Be good.

354
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,260
Listen to me.

355
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,620
Mom went abroad.

356
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,740
She's gone very, very far away.

357
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,340
It'll be a long time
before she comes back.

358
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,980
Be good and come home with me.

359
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,100
When Mom comes back,
I'll take you to see her.

360
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,980
Okay?

361
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,820
No, I want to see my mom now!

362
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,660
Let's go!

363
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,020
You're my aunt.

364
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,860
You're not my mom!

365
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,900
From now on,

366
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I am your mom.

367
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,620
Han Yijing!

368
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:51,900
Hurry!

369
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,500
Han Yijing! Ms. Han!

370
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,060
Han Yijing.

371
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Ms. Han.

372
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,980
Say something, Han Yijing.

373
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,020
Are you truly retiring
or is it a delay tactic?

374
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,420
Do you have anything to clarify
regarding the revelations online?

375
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,780
Was that all staged for ACME?

376
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,620
Ms. Han, please respond.

377
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,580
Ms. Han.

378
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Can you respond to the question?

379
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,900
Please say something, Han Yijing.

380
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,580
Please say something.

381
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,420
Ms. Han, please say something.

382
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,220
Ms. Han.

383
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,780
Ms. Han, please respond.

384
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

385
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,140
We've been working on it.

386
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,540
Understood.

387
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,660
I'll get back to you.

388
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,860
No problem.

389
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,580
Mr. Li is going to bring
some other investors

390
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,660
over to the company

391
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,540
to discuss

392
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,220
the future of ACME without Han Yijing.

393
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,580
I think they might be…

394
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,460
Apologies.

395
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,540
I didn't see you in a chat here.

396
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,420
Go back and think it over.

397
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,660
Two years

398
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,940
will pass in a blink.

399
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,100
You're leaving too?

400
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,900
To France.

401
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,580
Panio recommended him to Rhône

402
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,020
and invited him to the full-season shows
for the next two years.

403
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,300
Seriously?

404
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,180
What's there to hesitate about?

405
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,220
It's Rhône!

406
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,780
Listen, Jia Fan.

407
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,540
So many models

408
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,860
are dying to get in but never make it.

409
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,340
Especially rookies like you.

410
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,020
Once you complete a full-season show,

411
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,940
everything will be different for you.

412
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,740
You might even surpass Xing Mo.

413
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,500
Let him decide for himself.

414
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
See,

415
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
you heard it too.

416
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,300
Public opinion has indeed improved,

417
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
but Yijing has retired.

418
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,340
Plus, Xing Mo wants
to terminate the contract.

419
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,500
The company is losing two stars at once.

420
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
No company could handle that.

421
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,180
Investors might pull out.

422
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,540
So the only solution now

423
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,900
is to find the next Han Yijing

424
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,860
in the shortest time possible.

425
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,140
And that will be you.

426
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,620
I'll arrange for someone
to look after your dad.

427
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,660
I'll try to set up
a medical consultation

428
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,060
before you leave.

429
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,300
Yes.

430
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,620
Ms. Ling

431
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,580
has been looking for a doctor.

432
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,740
There's been some progress.

433
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,340
We'll see how it goes
after the consultation.

434
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,620
It shouldn't be a big issue.

435
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,260
I...

436
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,300
[Xiaoru]

437
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,620
Thank you for your patience
with me over the years.

438
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,180
But I'm sorry.

439
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,580
I'm not as good as you think.

440
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,120
As for the sequelae,

441
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,620
Han Jialing was completely unaware.

442
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,500
She is my aunt,

443
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,340
but she's also the head of ACME.

444
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,100
There were many things
I couldn't tell her.

445
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,620
And it was the same for her.

446
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,740
What needed to be said,

447
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,300
I've said it.

448
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,580
Everything else won't be shared
no matter how much you ask.

449
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,380
Let's call it an end.

450
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,300
Everything about Han Yijing

451
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,220
ends here.

452
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,540
This is between me and her.

453
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,980
Focus on your own situation.

454
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,340
Decide as soon as possible.

455
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,780
Ms. Ling!

456
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,540
Answer the call!

457
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,100
What are you doing?

458
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,420
Stop it.

459
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,580
You met Huang Jinde, didn't you?

460
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,060
You've never married

461
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,540
or had kids,

462
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,500
and yet I still don't appreciate it.

463
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,260
Do you regret it?

464
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,860
Every time I mention my mom,

465
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,020
what do you feel?

466
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,180
Do you think I'm pathetic?

467
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,220
Yijing.

468
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,180
Why did you lie to me?

469
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,260
I couldn't tell you.

470
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,060
I always thought...

471
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
you were the reason I lost my mom...

472
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,820
and it was you who had forced her
to leave the country...

473
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,180
so I would never see her
in my whole life.

474
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Where are you going?

475
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,140
The money in the bank account

476
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,740
and this house

477
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,100
should be enough for the penalty fee.

478
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,580
This is exactly what I was afraid of

479
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,820
and why I never told you.

480
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,460
Han Yijing.

481
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,780
No matter what, I'm still your aunt.

482
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,260
I will never leave you alone.

483
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,700
Even if I had to choose again,

484
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,660
I would do the same.

485
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
But I would not go with you.

486
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,580
At least that way,
I would just be an orphan.

487
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,540
But now?

488
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,180
I don't even know who I am anymore.

489
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,900
Why is she here?

490
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,620
You Ning?

491
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,980
What's she doing here?

492
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,700
Auditioning, obviously.

493
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,820
I heard she switched to acting.

494
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,300
Will Han Yijing switch too?

495
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,420
Is the bar for acting so low now?

496
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,860
She won't get any roles anyway.

497
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,660
With her deadpan face

498
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,500
and all her problems,

499
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,460
who would even cast her?

500
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,060
You Ning?

501
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,140
Haven't heard from you for a while.

502
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,300
Turns out you came to me.

503
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,060
I'm now You Ning the new actress.

504
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,540
I look forward to your guidance.

505
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,100
Okay.

506
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,460
Now, stand up.

507
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,860
Walk a few steps.

508
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,700
Come on.

509
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,340
Turn around.

510
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,940
Good.

511
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,860
Walk.

512
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,780
One more time.

513
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,740
Walk.

514
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,500
As expected from a model.

515
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,980
The body and proportions

516
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,900
are amazing.

517
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,540
May I ask

518
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,380
when we're starting the audition?

519
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,300
No rush.

520
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,740
What are your measurements?

521
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,220
It's in my profile.

522
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,740
Is it?

523
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,140
Do models usually have small busts?

524
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,260
True, they're not big.

525
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,620
Okay.

526
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,700
Play the role of a single young woman.

527
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,140
You've been lonely for too long,

528
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,140
so you go to a nightclub for fun.

529
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,380
While you're having a blast alone
on the dance floor

530
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,060
you turn around
and see your ex-boyfriend.

531
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,740
The ex is also drunk.

532
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,180
So he insists on kissing you

533
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,220
and getting back together.

534
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,780
You guess what?

535
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,100
You get into it too.

536
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
So you...

537
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,060
Sorry.

538
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
This isn't the scene I prepared.

539
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,020
As an actress,

540
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,300
you need to be able to improvise.

541
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,220
Come on.

542
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,100
Are you ready?

543
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,060
You can start.

544
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,980
See? Told you so.

545
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,260
Models can't act.

546
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,460
They're too stiff and serious

547
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,740
to let loose.

548
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,020
What a joke.

549
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,140
Trying to gaslight me, huh?

550
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,180
Won't work.

551
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,100
And you call yourself a director?

552
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,500
As if.

553
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,380
What did you just say?

554
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,380
What did I say?

555
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,500
You don't check profiles,
and you don't read scripts?

556
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,300
I auditioned for a martial arts master.

557
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,220
What nightclub? What dancing?

558
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,740
Does that even fit the role?

559
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,220
You just messing around?

560
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,020
Treating auditions like a joke?

561
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,940
Trash.

562
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,980

Do you know

why I was so desperate
for her to succeed?

624
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,180
Because only by standing high enough,

625
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,100
can she be seen by her mother.

626
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,620
Only then will her mother regret it.

627
