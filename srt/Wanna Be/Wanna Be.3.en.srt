97
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,540

98
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,780

99
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,940
He can see,

100
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,180
just not clearly.

Don't tell me you didn't see them.

105
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,540
He won't use pain relief patches

106
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,580
because he's afraid
you'll notice the smell.

107
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,740

against me calling you today.

Just for the daytime,
with two meals included.

111
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
It won't cost much.

112
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,740
Xiaoru,

113
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,220

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,260
We're incompatible.

115
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,820
Trouble follows every time I meet him.

116
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,700
It's happened twice now.

117
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,260
Why did he go to the hospital?

118
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,020
I have no idea.

119
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
Yet he insisted on treating me to a meal

120
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,460
and asking all these weird questions.

121
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,380
It was like an interview.

122
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,660
How did you get into modeling?

123
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,820
How much can you earn?

124
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,220
When will you start earning money?

125
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,380
Yijing.

126
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,260
At least have a bite, Yijing.

127
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,420
Could you send me the contact details

128
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,340
of the friend

129
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,900
who took me to the hospital

130
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,540
that evening?

131
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,860
All right, thanks.

132
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,700
Stop joking.

133
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,620
You think just because you're taller
and have a better figure,

134
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,500
you can become a model?

135
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm telling you, it won't work.

136
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,420
You'd be better off
becoming a chef in France.

137
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,100
How come others believe it can work?

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,420
But the people I'm closest to...

139
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,580
It's because you're close to me

140
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,420
that I dare to tell you the truth.

141
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,540
I need to look out for you.

142
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,140
Fan,

143
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,260
I know you have many talents,

144
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,820
but we need to face reality.

145
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,900
The reality
is that I'll be stuck selling fish

146
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,180
in the market forever?

147
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,020
That's not what I meant.

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,700
You

149
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,340
know I'm rebellious.

150
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,980
The more others doubt me,

151
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,940
the more I want to prove myself.

152
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,860
So don't try to persuade me.

153
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,700
It'll only have the opposite effect.

154
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,940
Has something happened, Fan?

155
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,060
Why are you suddenly
thinking of switching careers?

156
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,380
It's not that I doubt you,

157
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,940
I'm just afraid
you'll make the wrong choice.

158
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,340
You can't let a few compliments

159
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,100
cloud your judgment.

160
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,900
His eyes can't be fixed,

161
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
and surgery won't help.

162
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,100
All these years, I've done nothing,

163
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,580
and I've been too afraid to go far.

164
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,900
But it doesn't change anything

165
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,580
because his vision keeps getting worse,

166
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,020
and in the end,
he still won't be able to see.

167
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,780
So I've made up my mind.

168
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,380
Instead of staying stuck,

169
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,460
I might as well take a risk.

170
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,460
I need him to see

171
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,860
that his son

172
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,300
can do more than just sell fish.

173
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,980
Have you decided what you'll do then?

174
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,020
Be a model?

175
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
Or be a chef?

176
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,540
It's all up to you.

177
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,780
Since you insist on taking the risk

178
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,820
and I can't stop you,

179
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,460
I'll just follow along.

180
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,300
After all, you are important to me.

181
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,540
If you choose to be a chef,

182
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,660
I'll help take care of Mr. Jia
with my mom.

183
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,420
It will only be

I don't expect anything in return,

325

but you shouldn't make things
difficult for me,

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,220
Yes, I won't give up
until I reach a dead end.

337
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,380
Then I have a condition.

338
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,100
Go ahead.

343
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,460
Deal.

344
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,860
As a model,

345
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,380
you must have
excellent time management skills:

346
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,660
sleeping early and waking up early.

347
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,500
Next,

348
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,940
you must constantly monitor
your physique.

349
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,540
Whether or not you look good in clothes

350
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,580
depends on your muscle definition.

351
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,260
You must avoid midnight snacks,

352
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,140
especially carbs.

353
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,820
Also, practice taking selfies.

354
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,420
At least fifty a day,

355
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,500
with no filters.

356
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,380
These are all you've got?

357
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,180
I'm counting on you, the top stylist.

358
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,500
Fashion sense is the most basic,

359
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,740
yet the most crucial,

360
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,820
and it can't be developed overnight.

361
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,260
Do you still have the outfit
I mentioned last time?

362
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,220
Save it for me.

363
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,220
I'll be there soon.

364
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,820
I'll handle the styling,

365
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,900
but you'll have to work on
your runway walk.

366
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,900
And it's urgent.

367
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,460
Don't worry.

368
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,220

So, you were the one who called me

370
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,460
earlier?

371
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,780
I'll count on you now, Mr. Pit.

372
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,380
Hang on.

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,460
Who's Mr. Pit?

374
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,220
Are you making fun of me?

375
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,740
Aren't you Mr. Pit?

376
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,100
It's Peter.

377
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,620
And my last name is Li, not Pit.

378
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,940

Wait.

Why can't you train me?

383
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
Isn't it obvious?

384
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100

that final push.

How could I possibly train you?

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,060
Didn't you say
it was a ten-day crash course?

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,020
I was probably too excited at the time.

And with ads,

404
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,620
there's always
a bit of exaggeration, right?

405
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,620
If you can train me well,
it won't be an exaggeration anymore.

I guess that's why

437

even these unlicensed training schools

Let me explain.

532
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,820
I've kept saying

533
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,220
I wouldn't train him,

534
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,740
but this guy wouldn't give up

535
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,340
and kept begging me,

536
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,500
saying that he'd like to train with me.

537
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,580
But to be fair,

538
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,340
anyone with a dream is admirable.

539
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,820
He didn't do anything wrong.

540
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,090
If I call and report
the unlicensed business,

541
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,940
that would be even more justified,

542
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,220
wouldn't it?

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,580
Oh, please, I beg you.

of getting the license.

00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,740
and would never enter this industry.

555
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,220
Why the sudden change of heart?

556
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,260
Just like you,

557
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,420
it's all about fame and fortune.

558
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,060
As well as your dream.

559
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,340
Don't be embarrassed to admit it.

560
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,540
Yijing, I'm telling you,

561
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,620
this guy has potential.

562
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,300
He's serious, hardworking,

563
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,340
and a fast learner.

564
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,420
He's got talent.

565
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,020
Your hair is as messy as a bird's nest,

566
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
your clothes are full of wrinkles,

567
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,140
and your pants are too short,

568
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,180
not even matching your shoes.

569
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,500
With your current state,

570
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,420
you think you'll make it?

571
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,940
Don't even think about it.

572
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,220
You're right.

573
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,620
So, could you give me some guidance?

574
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,660
Guidance?

575
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,380
You've set the benchmark
in the industry.

576
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,380
As a senior,

577
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,660
it should be easy for you
to give me some guidance.

578
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,500
Are you sure?

579
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
Most people can't handle my taste.

580
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,820
I don't mind.

581
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,900
I'm hopeless anyway.

582
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,940
Might as well give it a shot.

583
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
Then close your eyes.

584
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,620
Why?

585
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,460
You want advice, right?

586
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,420
Then you need to trust me completely.

587
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,860
Never mind then.

588
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,900
All right.

589
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,700
Let's do this.

590
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,700
Han Yijing.

591
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,300
Stop right there!

592
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,100
Han Yijing.

593
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,980
Stop right there!

594
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,700
Why do you keep picking on me?

595
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,380
Is it because I know about your past?

596
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,900
Yes,

597
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,380
every time I see you,
I just feel uncomfortable.

598
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,780
You should just expose everything online

599
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,460
and get it over with.

600
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,540
That way, both of us can be at ease.

601
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,220
Since you've helped me before,

602
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,300
I'll be honest with you.

603
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,300
This industry isn't as simple
as you think,

604
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,540
especially for male models.

605
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,820
Every year, thousands like you

606
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,380
come and go,

607
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,580
wasting money and time,

608
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,860
and achieving nothing.

609
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,340
So stop dreaming

610
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
and do what you need to do.

611
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,180
What about you then?

612
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,300
After such a severe car accident,

613
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,780
you made a comeback
in less than three years.

614
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,540
It must have been tough, right?

615
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,100
Enduring the rehabilitation process

616
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,540
while facing

617
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,740
an onslaught
of negative comments online,

618
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,020
not to mention the aftereffects
you're still dealing with.

619
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,340
You went through so much pain

620
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,180
and still decided to return to the stage
without hesitation.

621
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:40,900
Why?

622
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,380
If you can do it, so can I.

623
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,900
Don't worry.

624
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,860
I won't bring up your past.

625
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,460
But please don't interfere
with my choice.

626
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,060
After all, it was you who pushed me
onto the stage.

627
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,380
You sparked my fighting spirit,

628
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,660
so you shouldn't be advising me to stop,

629
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,580
nor should you take away
my right to dream.

630
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,620
At first, it was just a hobby.

631
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,220
But then I met you.

632
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,900
When I saw you in front of the camera,

633
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,140
I felt a sense of accomplishment
for the first time.

634
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,700
That's when I decided to keep going.

635
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm determined to become

636
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,220
a photographer worthy of you.

637
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,700
No matter what others say,

638
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,060
I'll never give up.

639
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,180
But until the results are out,

640
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,100
no matter what others say,

641
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,660
I will give my all

642
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,300
and never give up.
