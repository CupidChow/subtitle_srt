00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,750
That's ancient history.

192
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,120
Why are you so worked up?

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,840
But...

194
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,670
how did Han Yijing react?

195
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,200
Did she freeze on the spot?

196
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,120
She turned and left,

197
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,120
completely ignoring him.

198
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,080
She's obviously not over him.

199
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,630
The more she avoids him,

200
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,270
the more it proves she cares.

201
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,510
You don't know her.

202
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,670
You don't know women.

203
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,600
Women are good at saying
the opposite of what they feel,

204
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
especially when it comes to an ex.

205
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
The meaner a woman is,

206
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,440
the more she's probably still in love.

207
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,840
Hold this.

208
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,270
So what does Liao Jinyuan look like?

209
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,790
Hello?

210
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,030
Why was he there?

211
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,000
Taking photos?

212
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,480
No, thanks. Not needed.

213
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,160
Go straight home when it's done.

214
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,310
I've canceled the dinner for you.

215
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,160
It's just a meal, no big deal.

216
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,200
So people don't keep thinking
I'm difficult.

217
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,510
Skip it.

218
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
With your current state...

219
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,270
Which is great.

220
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,350
You saw it yourself.

221
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,960
You didn't sleep well
last night, did you?

222
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,790
I declined the cover shoot too.

223
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,440
If anyone contacts you privately,

224
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,920
just say you don't know anything

225
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,640
and ignore them.

226
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,510
Why?

227
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,960
Just because it's Liao Jinyuan?

228
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,550
I don't care who he is or what he wants.

229
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,200
But I will not let him
get near you again.

230
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,480
You're underestimating me.

231
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,160
Then why did you leave early yesterday?

232
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,030
Because to you,

233
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,960
he's not just Whim's editor-in-chief.

234
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,480
I reminded you before.

235
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,590
Let me make it clear again.

236
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,110
If you let yourself
get swayed by him again,

237
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,310
I will leave you alone

238
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,920
and won't meddle
in your life ever again.

239
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,720
You can do whatever you want.

240
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,830
I just don't get it.

241
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,000
The wrong person is...

242
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,960
It's me.

243
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,110
Sorry.

244
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,920
I forgot to knock.

245
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,830
You've probably heard about it.

246
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,110
Think whatever you want.

247
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,240
Just don't ask me.

248
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,590
What else can I think?

249
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,110
I'd run too.

250
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,030
It was terrifying.

251
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,030
See for yourself.

252
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,960
Already scared someone out of her mind.

253
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,510
Lucky you ran fast.

254
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,350
Stop drinking.

255
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,030
Stop drinking.

256
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,720
Let go!

257
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,480
Don't worry.

258
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,880
Everything online
has been taken care of.

259
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,880
We've also reached out
to everyone present.

260
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,750
But we can't really act

261
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,110
like nothing ever happened.

262
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,790
So...

263
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,980
[Release Agreement]

264
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,830
Ms. Ling is dead set on this.

265
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,030
But given the time
you've known each other,

266
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,550
the terms are quite decent.

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,920
Take it home and have a look.

268
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,200
If you have any questions,

269
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,160
feel free to call me.

270
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,160
Ming...

271
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:10,920
Go ahead.

272
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,750
Why isn't Jinyuan in the video?

273
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,160
He didn't see it, right?

274
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,200
You Ning,

275
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,440
at a time like this,

276
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,750
you're still thinking about that?

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,550
I haven't seen him in three years.

278
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,270
And this is how we two met again.

279
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,550
My job's done.

280
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,030
The rest is up to you.

281
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,240
Ming.

282
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,590
Do you have his phone number?

283
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,110
No.

284
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,270
Do you know where he lives?

285
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,000
No idea.

286
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,790
Can you ask around for me?

287
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,110
You have so many connections.

288
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,680
You're beyond saving.

289
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,200
Even now,

290
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,680
you still don't get
the situation, You Ning.

291
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,480
You don't know what really matters

292
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
or what you're doing.

293
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,240
Just for a man,

294
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,510
you're throwing away your future.

295
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,550
You really disappoint me.

296
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,750
Fine. That's it.

297
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,480
It won't make a difference anyway.

298
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,830
Ming.

299
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,000
It's not that I don't want my future.

300
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,030
I just don't deserve one anymore.

301
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
If I were Ms. Ling,

302
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,880
I would do the same.

303
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,160
But as for Jinyuan,

304
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,830
if there's a chance,

305
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,750
I want to try one more time.

306
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,440
Otherwise,
I'll really have nothing left.

307
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,350
I'm sorry, Ming.

308
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,030
I've disappointed you again.

309
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,720
I've given her the agreement.

310
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
This time, she really knows
she was wrong.

311
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,880
We can keep an eye on her
to see how it goes.

312
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,350
Come in.

313
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,240
Ms. Ling.

314
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,680
I brought you

315
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,200
a new dish from our shop.

316
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
Blueberry tuna sandwich.

317
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,880
Hope you'll have a try.

318
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
No, thanks.

319
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,590
It's afternoon tea time.

320
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,240
I'm not hungry.

321
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,270
Okay.

322
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,240
Have it when you are.

323
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,310
Wait.

324
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,350
You spoke with him, right?

325
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,720
What did he say?

326
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,200
I knew it.

327
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,200
I knew he'd come back one day.

328
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,030
But I didn't expect it to be this soon

329
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,110
and in this way.

330
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,480
If he really had any intention,

331
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,440
he wouldn't have waited three years.

332
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,440
Then why was he so secretive?

333
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,790
He never showed up or left any messages.

334
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,960
What was he hiding?

335
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,400
He even had someone call

336
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,960
to confirm we'd be there.

337
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,200
With all this effort,

338
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,510
he was obviously coming for us.

339
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,880
It's not that simple.

340
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,000
That's why I have to be cautious.

341
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,880
To prevent them
from rekindling their past?

342
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,550
Besides that,

343
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,310
there isn't much else
to be cautious about.

344
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,640
He's no longer the photographer
he used to be.

345
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,590
He's the editor-in-chief of Whim China.

346
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,200
He worked his way up

347
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,480
on his own.

348
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,160
I don't need models
with perfectly delicate faces.

349
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,350
I want a face with character
over perfection.

350
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,160
At first,

351
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,960
he was just
a guest photographer for Whim.

352
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,270
He worked for six months
before he got hired full-time.

353
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,000
[Whim]
In just over two years,

354
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,830
he rose from editor to director

355
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,240
and then to executive editor-in-chief.

356
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,510
He earned full recognition
from the entire team.

357
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,640
To rise to that position

358
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,830
in such a short time
in a place like that,

359
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,440
he must have given and endured

360
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,310
more than what most people
could compare to.

361
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,110
And he's able to return this time

362
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,880
because he signed a binding contract.

363
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,750
He has a two-year term.

364
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,160
If he fails to deliver,

365
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,440
he'll have to pack up and leave.

366
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,520
He'll also have to
compensate for losses.

367
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,720
So don't worry.

368
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,030
In the next two years,

369
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,920
his focus will definitely be on Whim.

370
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,920
Otherwise, his years of effort
will be wasted

371
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,270
and he'll struggle
to stay in this industry.

372
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,880
As for relationships,

373
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,880
it's a mutual thing.

374
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,000
You have to trust Yijing.

375
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,310
She won't fall for the same thing twice.

376
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,240
Did he tell you all this?

377
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,750
Like you would believe him.

378
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,400
I found it out myself.

379
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,440
It's a tough position to be in.

380
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,160
I might end up pleasing no one.

381
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,480
Oh, yeah?

382
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,880
But why do I feel like
you're on his side?

383
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,350
All I want now is for you to relax,

384
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,110
eat properly,

385
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,240
and sleep well.

386
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,310
Try it.

387
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,640
Think of it

388
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,640
as repaying me for the favor.

389
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,110
Hello?

390
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,750
Hello?

391
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,680
It's over.

392
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,960
On the way to Yijing's home.

393
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,550
What?

394
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,240
How would I know?
I've been busy all day.

395
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,160
Just say it.

396
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,590
Jia Fan?

397
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,160
Wait,

398
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,880
how's that possible?

399
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,310
I've got to go.

400
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,310
Yijing's sleeping.

401
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,240
Talk later.

402
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,070
Bye-bye.

403
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,000
Shubo.

404
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,920
What's with Jia Fan?

405
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,160
He's now a candidate
for the cover shoot.

406
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,830
That's what Shubo said.

407
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,310
Yijing.

408
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,440
Don't overthink the cover thing.

409
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,000
Maybe they've wanted
a male model from the start.

410
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,270
Besides, they most probably picked
Jia Fan because of you.

411
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,310
I didn't mean it that way.

412
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm just worried about you.

413
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,510
You've let it go.

414
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,550
You don't need to prove it

415
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,880
to anyone in any way.

416
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,880
No one else

417
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,440
but yourself matters.

418
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,720
I know.

419
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,240
Get home and rest.

420
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,510
Sleep early.

421
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,480
Goodnight.

422
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:05,920
Let's go.

423
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,030
Drink slowly.

424
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,640
Don't gulp.

425
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,440
I mean,

426
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,270
is there anything you want to tell me?

427
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,790
I forgot.

428
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,270
Nothing you want to tell me in person?

429
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,310
Yeah, there is.

430
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,070
You see, Mom is so pretty.

431
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,310
She must've had tons of admirers.

432
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,960
How did she end up with you?

433
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,160
You're really...

434
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,830
annoying.

435
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,110
No, I mean, you must have had
something special.

436
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,720
Right?

437
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,070
It couldn't have just been your looks.

438
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,830
My mom isn't that shallow.

439
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,200
Of course.

440
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,070
Well,

441
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,160
I wouldn't say
I had any special qualities.

442
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,640
It all came down to this.

443
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,680
No one could compete

444
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,550
with a heart that never gives up.

445
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,880
Words don't mean anything.

446
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,640
You have to act on it.

447
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,510
First,

448
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,790
be confident, but not arrogant.

449
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,350
I might not be as well-off as her,

450
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,030
but I treated her
better than anyone else.

451
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,070
So no need to feel lesser.

452
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,830
Just give it your all.

453
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,480
Second,

454
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,110
you need to trust her

455
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,920
and make sure she feels secure.

456
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,000
When you have disagreements,

457
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,440
you can talk it out in private.

458
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,440
You can even argue, right?

459
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,680
But if there's an external issue,

460
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,640
remember,

461
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,480
always stand by her side
unconditionally.

462
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,750
Lastly,

463
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,030
it's all about hard work.

464
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,640
Whether you'll be together or not,

465
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,960
you should work hard.

466
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,920
To grow

467
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,110
and to become a better person.

468
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,680
And only by working hard,

469
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,000
can you give her more than just love.

470
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,640
You'll also give her hope.

471
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,960
Dad, you're great.

472
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,070
If I were Mom,

473
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,510
I'd marry you too.

474
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,270
Don't just talk. Put it into action.

475
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,160
You better start learning.

476
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,400
Come on.

477
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,680
Where are you going?
You haven't finished eating.

478
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,960
Learning from you.

479
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,030
Can't you learn tomorrow?

480
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,680
It's so late.

481
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,640
Are you tearing the house apart?

482
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,000
Going back and forth...

483
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,240
Where are you going?

484
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,510
Go to bed first.

485
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,480
I'll clean up when I'm back.

486
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,000
Guess a father's words still work.

487
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,790
Hey!

488
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,480
Where are you going?

489
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,880
Bringing fish fillets to our Ms. Han.

490
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,590
Fresh salmon from today.

491
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,750
High in protein.

492
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,200
Delicious and guilt-free.

493
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,400
Lucky I arrived early.

494
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,550
Or else, I'd have come for nothing.

495
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,240
Why didn't you call before coming?

496
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,240
It's a surprise.

497
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,200
Brought you chicken feet.

498
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,750
Mild spice, not too numbing.

499
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:40,960
There's plenty.

500
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,960
I should be the one going to you.

501
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,030
You must be exhausted
after a full day of shooting.

502
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,750
I'm starving. I haven't eaten all day.

503
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,270
I haven't either.

504
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,350
Let's eat together.

505
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,720
Let's go.

506
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,880
What a surprise.

507
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,240
Ms. Ling would call and invite me.

508
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,350
That was a shock.

509
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,640
Speaking of shocks,

510
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,160
it's nothing compared to you.

511
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,590
Don't get me wrong.

512
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,000
I just wanted some peace and quiet.

513
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,000
I didn't want to come back

514
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,000
and get caught up
in endless socializing.

515
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,550
That's all there is to it.

516
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,590
Then why did you pick Jia Fan?

517
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,110
After all, it's the cover
of the first issue.

518
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,960
Giving it to a rookie
seems quite unreasonable.

519
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,790
Isn't he from ACME?

520
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,440
Shouldn't you be happy about it?

521
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,000
Why,

522
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,070
are you here to interrogate me today?

523
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,270
If you weren't involved in this,

524
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,270
of course, I'd be happy.

525
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,440
First of all,

526
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,590
Whim has its own standards.

527
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,790
It's not just up to me
as the editor-in-chief.

528
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,750
Second,

529
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,160
what happened back then is history.

530
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,920
There was never any agreement
between us.

531
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,000
Nor can we say we have
any personal ties either.

532
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,200
So whatever I say or do

533
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,160
doesn't require your approval.

534
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,830
This place is the best.

535
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,960
Quiet and safe.

536
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,070
You get to eat anything you want.

537
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,790
And it's open 24/7.

538
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,590
Do you think

539
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,160
when I get famous,

540
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,110
we won't have to
keep things so secretive?

541
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,000
What's wrong
with keeping things secretive?

542
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,310
It's thrilling.

543
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,480
I got a call this afternoon.

544
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,830
They want me
to go for an interview on Friday.

545
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,310
For Whim's cover.

546
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,510
There must be plenty of candidates.

547
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,400
And every single one of them
is probably better than me.

548
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,160
Whether I go or not,
it's the same.

549
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,440
You should still go.

550
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,440
You can't give up

551
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,360
such a good opportunity because of me.

552
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,630
Whim's editor-in-chief is named Leslie,

553
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,800
or Liao Jinyuan.

554
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,590
He used to be a photographer...

555
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,360
and my boyfriend.

556
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,540
Three years ago,

557
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,140
we were going to get married in Canada.

558
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,180
But he backed out at the last minute.

559
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,300
I got into a car accident
on my way to the airport

560
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,740
and didn't see him since.

561
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,820
It was like he vanished from the world.

562
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,380
Until that banquet.

563
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,420
But as her aunt,

564
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,660
I won't just sit back and do nothing.

565
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,380
I suggest you drop
whatever you're up to.

566
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,300
Do not try to approach her
under any pretext.

567
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,780
I hope from now on,

568
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,340
you'll focus on being
the editor-in-chief

569
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,940
and stay out of her way.

570
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,140
It wasn't easy for either of you
to get to where you are today.

571
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,100
So don't mess it up.

572
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,860
You're done?

573
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,740
Sorry.

574
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Thank you very much
for the reminder, Ms. Ling.

575
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,820
But this time...

576
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,740
I can't do it.
