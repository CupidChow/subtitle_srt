00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,660
Being a model
is not as easy as you think,

4
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,140
especially for a male model.

5
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,020
Thousands of people like you

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,620

00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,740
Having wasted their time and money,

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,900
they leave empty-handed.

11
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,220
Hello.

12
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,860
I was wrong, Yijing.

13
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,260
I shouldn't have lied to you.

14
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,340
I promise

15
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,540
I will tell you anything.

16
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
Don't tell Ms. Ling. I beg you.

If you make it,
it'll become your side hustle.

19
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,420
If you don't, it'll make you a hustler.

20
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,580
What do you mean?

21
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,380
What about Curly?

22
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Handle it as you see fit.

You're back.

00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,780
Stop for a bit.

29
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,420
Are these photos

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,820
meant for his portfolio?

31
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,780
Yes. What's wrong?

32
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,100
He has to pose naturally.

33
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
He was being too dramatic.

34
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,300
Was I?

35
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,980
Weren't you?

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,060
I thought you were doing a photo book.

37
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,060
Let's take ten.

38
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,340
Try to loosen up.

39
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,580
What's wrong with you?

40
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,340
I told you to get yourself prepared.

41
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,420
I did.

42
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,780
I prepped myself up the whole night.

43
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,740
Mentally, I mean.

44
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,380
Not physically.

45
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,340
As a beginner,

46
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,380
confidence is all that matters.

Copying others' styles

48
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,580
will drain your confidence

49
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,420

Why are you here?

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,020
I'm also having a photo shoot.

What?

67
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,660
Do I need another haircut?

68
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,980
Much better after the haircut.

69
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,700

77
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,020
Gosh.

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,300
This place has a good reputation.

79
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,140
Now I believe it.

80

Even Yijing is here.

81
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,140
Wait for me.

82
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Did you see it?

83
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,260
Learn from her, OK?

84
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,020
But no pressure.

85
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,980
After all, she...

86
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,580
She's one of the best in modeling.

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,340
Just like I'm the best
at handling sashimi.

88
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,420
I was born with the talent.

89
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,900
You have a good understanding of yourself.

90
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,100
Practice makes perfect.

91
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,820
After a few more photo shoots,

92
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,900
I'll definitely do...

93
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,580
better than her.

94
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,420
You're pretty thick-skinned.

95
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,740
Shall we call it a day?

96
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,780
Two more, please.

97
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,220
Please. I really appreciate it.

98
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,980
Wait a minute.

99
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,380
What are you doing here?

100
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,580
This is the question I want to ask you.

101
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,820
Dead eyes. Stiff limbs.

102
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,100
Didn't you sleep last night?

103
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,020
And your suit.

104
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,780
Did you just buy it from a supermarket

105
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,140
without even trying it on?

106
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm having a photo shoot.

107
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,220
Don't stand in the way.

108
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,660
You're wasting everyone's time.

109
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,860
Yijing.

110
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,780
Do I have to get your consent

111
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,500
before I have a photo shoot?

112
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,460
You told me

113
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,060
I inspired you, didn't you?

114
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,340
How can I, in that case,

115
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,020
watch you humiliate yourself?

116
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,660
You're my responsibility.

117
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,460
The camera can't see your eyes
and your belly button at the same time.

118
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,500
This is the most basic rule.

119
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,780
What?

120
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,900
Don't get nervous.

121
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,180
I'm not eating you up.

122
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,940
You have too many things on you.

123
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,820
Get rid of some.

124
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,500
No worries.

125
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm not interested in you at all.

126
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,260
No. There are many people watching.

127
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,220
Let's have some relaxing jazz music.

128
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,980
OK.

129
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,820
You saw me in the photo shoot,
didn't you?

130
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,500
Dare to show yourself

131
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,500
without thinking
about your handsome face.

132
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,860
True confidence

133
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,540
is daring to show one's imperfection.

134
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
And your eyes.

135
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,540
It's normal to feel awkward

136
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,820
to do something you're not good at

137
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,700
in a place that's strange to you.

138
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,620
This is exactly

139
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,460
when you should learn to blend in.

140
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,380
You were acting quite naturally
when you were busy

141
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,340
with your work in the market.

142
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,900
Your eyes looked firm
when you were handling sashimi.

143
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,500
How do you know?

144
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,980
Turn off the front light on the left.

145
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,740
Are you not shooting?

146
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,340
The model is ready.

147
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,180
Alright, come on.

148
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,020
Drinking coffee late at night,

149
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,020
are you not going to sleep?

150
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,620
You're too nosy, don't you think?

151
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,460
You're so ungrateful.

152
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,300
I'm talking about the fish guy.

153
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,260
His name is Jia Fan.

154
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,740
He's a participant after all.

155
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,180
We should remain neutral

156
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,260
to avoid gossip or even scandals.

157
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,260
What did I do?

158
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,500
A tip or two, that's all.

159
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,140
What about that?

160
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,660
Do you treat others

161
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,940
the same way?

162
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,500
No.

163
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,580
He reminds me of you

164
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,220
when you just entered this industry.

165
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,180
You were eager

166
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,540
but your body wouldn't work along.

167
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,340
He has high self-esteem

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,500
and never admits defeat,

169
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,100
just like you used to do.

170
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,180
So do you mean

171
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
you think he has potential

172
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,980
and want to help him win this thing

173
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,900
and get him into Moyi Road?

174
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,980
I didn't mean that.

175
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,260
That's why you helped me back then.

176
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,900
I wouldn't help anyone.

177
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,100
You distort my words.

178
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,580
You're getting more stupid

179
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,460
staying with You Ning for too long.

180
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,340
Come over and give me a hand.

181
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,020
It's hurting my scalp.

182
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,020
Your chin was squeezed,

183
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,460
the belt taken off.

184
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,620
"Don't get nervous.

185
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,620
I'm not eating you up.

186
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,580
You have too many things on you.

187
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,020
Get rid of some."

188
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,580
You're the stylist here.

189
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,420
Shouldn't you be ashamed?

190
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,980
Let me go!

191
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,660

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,620
He's not that ate, is he?

381
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,340
He's the last one in Group F.

382
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,180
Did something happen on your way here?

383
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,540
Car accident?

384
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,180
See? There's blood on his sleeves.

385
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,060
Late is late.

386
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
I won't make excuses.

387
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,140
I only want a chance to perform,

388
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,220
even if you won't score me

389
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,180
and eliminate me right away.

390
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,900
Can you still do it?

391
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,820
Yes, I can.

392
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,820
Are you ready?

393
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,780
Get started then.

394
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,780
Coffee making?

395
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,180
Pretty creative.

396
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,540
I thought he'd kill fish.

397
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,700
What kind of talent show is this?

398
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,060
What does this have anything to do with modeling?

399
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,260
Yeah.

400
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,540
We can't tell if he has what it takes to be a model.

401
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,340
I wanted to customize the pattern

402
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,980
for each of you.

403
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,500
But I don't know you enough

404
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,300
so I go as I see fit.

405
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
Please forgive me

406
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,380
if you don't like it.

407
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,820
I thought you worked at a seafood store.

408
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,780
I'm not good at coffee making.

409
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,580
I asked someone to teach me,

410
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,860
especially for this contest.

411
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,420
I only had a cup of coffee or two.

412
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,060
I don't know much about it.

413
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,780
I may have only spent two hours

414
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,180
on learning to make coffee in total.

415
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,140
If luck favors me and let me pass,

416
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,180
I will...

417
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,500
So your talent show

418
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,660
[Han Yijing]
is your ability to learn?

419
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,380
Yes.

420
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,020
I sell fish for a living.

421
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,140
I can make you coffee today

422
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,140
and tomorrow,

423
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,540
I may become a professional model.

424
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,220
Any more reasons?

425
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,140
Tell us the truth.

426
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,980
To impress you.

427
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,900
I hope

428
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,260
you will be reminded of me

429
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,620
by the coffee I made.

430
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,420
You're clever.

431
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,900
So, No. 96,

432
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,820
prêt-à-porter,

433
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,700
haute couture,

434
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,180
what do they mean?

435
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,820
What's the difference

436
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,100
between ready-to-wear
and made-to-measure?

437
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,700
I've read your resume.

438
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,020
Your experience

439
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,580
has zero relevance to modeling.

440
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,700
You decided
to take part in the audition,

441
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,660
so you should've prepared
yourself for it.

442
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,940
All that talk of yours

443
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,460
and the mere grandstanding

444
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,660
aren't enough to get you there.

445
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,860
He can learn the theory later.

446
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,060
Talent and determination
are what matter the most.

447
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,860
Now I doubt how determined he is.

448
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,780
Can you answer my question?

449
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,420
If you can't...

450
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Haute couture,

451
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,500
or made-to-measure,
is a phrase that originated

452
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,020
from the famous designer
who set his career in Paris,

453
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,820
Charles Frederick Worth.

454
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,340
His design concept is one-on-one...

455
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,620
Charles Frederick Worth.

456
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,380
His design concept is one-on-one

457
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,940
customized garments for certain clients,

458
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,900
so his standard for garments
is extremely high.

459
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,180
And ready-to-wear

460
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,180
is something between
customized and mass-produced.

461
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,060
Its main customers are the middle class.

462
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,420
Simply put,

463
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,100
haute couture is a symbol
of high social status,

464
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,060
just like you, Ms. Han.

465
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,820
While ready-to-wear

466
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,380
represents personal taste

467
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,060
which suits ordinary people
like me more.

468
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,980
OK.

469
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,220
One last question.

470
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,700
Why do you want to be a model?

471
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,940
Stepping into a totally strange industry

472
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,700
requires much determination.

473
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,700
Why?

474
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,740
Because of one person.

475
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,820
At first, all I wanted
was to make more money

476
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,980
so I could have a better life.

477
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,780
The time when I was preparing
for the audition

478
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,620
was harsh

479
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,300
and tiring.

480
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,700
I didn't know
what was lying ahead of me.

481
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,100
But I felt content.

482
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,220
So I want to do this for myself.

483
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,940
Nothing special actually.

484
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,460
Everybody has a dream.

485
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,300
But when I was little,

486
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,500
I only dreamed when I slept.

487
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,100
Daydreaming?

488
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,420
It's my first time to do so.

489
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,580
His vision is narrowing.

490
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,780
Your dad is aging.

491
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,220
His resistance and resilience

492
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,260
has declined a lot.

493
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,620
If this goes on,

494
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,940
he'll soon lose his vision entirely.

495
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,940
You need to be prepared.

496
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,340
What about surgery?

497
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,340
Retinitis pigmentosa

498
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,380
is a rare disease.

499
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,060
Having surgery will only postpone

500
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,100
the coming of the last stage.

501
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,140
There is no cure for it.

502
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,220
Moreover,

503
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,060
this is a hereditary disease.

504
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,700
Not one hundred percent

505
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,940
but

506
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,300
highly probable.

507
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,340
I suggest you have an overall check.

508
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,780
I used to feel that my life

509
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,820
was a tunnel.

510
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Very dark.

511
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,660
Very long.

512
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,980
And very narrow.

513
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,460
So narrow that
all that I can see is money.

514
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,260
It stayed that way
until one chance came to me.

515
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,700
I stood on a place

516
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,620
called "runway".

517
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,980
There, I saw light.

518
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,380
So I was wondering,

519
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
can my life

520
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,940
be like a runway?

521
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,260
It doesn't have to be long,

522
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,820
but there has to be light,

523
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,340
audience,

524
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,820
applause,

525
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,540
and hope.

526
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,020
I clearly know

527
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,060
that I have much to learn

528
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,500
before I become a model.

529
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,780
Therefore, recently, I've been trying

530
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
to make up for it whenever I have time.

531
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,940
I went to a bookstore to buy a magazine

532
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,540
that had ceased publication
a long time ago.

533
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,660
In it, I saw one of you here.

534
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,100
Happiess.

535
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,460
Pain.

536
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,580
Despair.

537
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,620
All kinds of emotions.

538
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,300
I was so inspired.

539
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,060
Taking photos isn't something easy.

540
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,860
It's not simply about
showing one's beauty.

541
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,020
It's about delivering sentiments

542
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,340
with one's body and expressions.

543
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,380
The magazine you mentioned is...

544
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,540
The One.

545
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,660
It takes great courage for me

546
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,100
to stand before you.

547
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,460
I won't regret it

548
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,380
no matter what the result is.

549
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,220
Give me a chance

550
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,220
and I'll become a professional model

551
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,100
in a short period.

552
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,300
I hope you

553
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
can trust me.

554
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,860
Thank you.
