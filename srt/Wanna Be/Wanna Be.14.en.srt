[Wanna Be]

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,220
I can't believe what just happened.

3
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,620
We can't just let this slide.

4
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,300
We have to stand up for Fan.

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,140
[Do not disturb during training]
He's the one Ms. Ling values the most.

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,580
We're just some small fries.

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,580
We don't stand a chance against him.

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,860
Even so, we can't back down,

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,420
or he'll think he can push us around.

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,340
What happened to Jia Fan today
could be our fate tomorrow.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,060
Exactly.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,220
All right now.

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
I have a feeling

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,220
there's more to this.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,140
It doesn't seem like something
Mo would do.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,100
Then who else could have done it?

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,380
How would I know?

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,180
We're not kids anymore.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,540
We need to think for ourselves

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,540
and see beyond the surface.

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,100
Appearances can be deceiving.

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,780
Then why would he help Fan train?

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,260
Since we can't change anything now,

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,700
let's use it to our advantage

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,940
and get people on our side.

26
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,100
That makes sense.

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,220
Then embarrass ourselves
in front of everyone?

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,660
That's just stupid.

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,140
It's basically shooting ourselves
in the foot.

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,500
Besides,

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,380
Fan wasn't replaced

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,620
just because he was late.

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,260
It was because he was injured.

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,980
Don't tell me that was planned too?

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,460
Zhou Lu.

36

What's your take on this?

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,140
I don't think

Are you all warmed up?

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,020
I have three things to announce.

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,700
First, the issue with the shoot
was purely an accident.

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,820
No baseless speculation is allowed.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,220
Anyone caught spreading rumors
will be strictly punished,

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,220
with no exceptions.

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,540
Second, by the end of this month,

46
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,260
there will be an evaluation
for new trainees.

47
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,980
Your final results will be based

48
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,580
on both your test performance
and overall progress.

49
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,860
Those who pass

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,380
will receive their own model cards

51
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,180
and officially become models.

52
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,020
Third, until the evaluation is over,

53
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,620
I'll be stepping in
as your temporary supervisor.

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,700
I expect everyone
to give it their all and stay focused.

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,580
Looking forward to working with you.

56
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,140
If you have any questions, speak up now.

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,060
Mr. Wu,

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,540
why step in yourself?

59
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,860
Isn't Dong still around?

60
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,660
Does having our own model card

61
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,500
mean we can go on stage?

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,700
When can we start taking business deals?

63
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,780
How's Fan?

64
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,500
When will he be back on the team?

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,580
Okay.

66
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,860
If you are all set, let's get started.

67
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,500
Why are you here?

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
Did Ms. Ling also call you over?

69
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,460
No.

70
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,380
Are you also here about the party?

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,460
That makes sense.
Your name isn't on the list either.

72
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,060
I'm not.

73
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,380
Well, I am.

74
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,020
I've got my whole look ready,

75
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,180
but now they won't let me go.

76
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,380
This might be my last chance
to turn things around,

77
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,220
so let me in first, okay?

78
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,620
Let me go in first.

79
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,420
What issue could you possibly have

80
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,740
that's more important than my future?

81
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,300
It's serious.

82
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,220
It's about the future of two people.

83
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Ms. Ling.

84
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
Ms. Ling, I swear I know I messed up.

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,060
I shouldn't have targeted Han Yijing.

86
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,460
I shouldn't have mentioned Jinyuan.

87
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,140
I shouldn't have

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,820
secretly met Mr. Chen from Rachel.

89
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,620
And I shouldn't have acted out
toward you.

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,260
In short, I shouldn't have gone
against you.

91
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,300
I've learned from my mistakes,

92
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,180
and it won't happen again.

93
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,500
Please let me
attend this party just this once

94
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,700
to prove myself. Is that okay?

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,460
For now, your only job

96
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,100
is to stay at home and reflect.

97
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,060
Once you truly get the point,

98
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,140
we'll talk.

99
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,420
Ms. Ling.

100
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Ms. Ling.

101
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,140
Sorry, Ning.

102
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,940
It's my turn now.

103
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,980
We'll go over the details
when we meet tomorrow.

104
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,660
Okay, bye.

105
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,620
Ms. Ling.

106
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,340
Please wait.

107
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
I need to speak with you.

108
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,420
No need,

109
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,300
I already know.

110
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,780
It wasn't Xing Mo who told me.

111
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,740
It was the surveillance footage.

112
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,340
Haoran, I chose you myself.

113
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,660
I've watched you grow
step by step over the years.

114
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,180
Even if you haven't seen
massive success yet,

115
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,100
you have always been making progress.

116
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,900
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,140
It's not me
you should be apologizing to.

118
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,660
It's the company and,

119
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,700
most of all, yourself.

120
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,460
I trust that this was just a lapse
in judgment,

121
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,180
but unfortunately,

122
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,580
no matter the reason,

123
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,860
harming others is unacceptable.

124
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,060
That is my bottom line.

125
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,940
I understand.

126
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm not here to make excuses.

127
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,620
I just hope you won't misunderstand Mo.

128
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,740
He was my first friend
when I joined the company,

129
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,820
and over the years,

130
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,300
he has helped me unconditionally.

131
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,020
Without him,

132
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
I wouldn't be where I am today.

Okay.

139

It's not necessarily a bad thing.

What's wrong?

Has it worsened again?

148
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,460
That's impossible.

149
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,980
I've been feeling fine lately.

150
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,740
This fall wasn't because of my eyesight.

151
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,180
It was just an accident.

I can handle it.

155

Your instincts

156
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,940
are pretty spot-on.

157
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,460
At this rate,

Listen though.

Keep it up.

164
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
Your condition not worsening

His biggest concern

173
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,300
was how to prevent it
from being passed down,

174
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,580

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
They may take lives

188
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,180
but they can't take away

189
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,420
our right to pursue happiness.

190
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,380
So don't be afraid.

191
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,140
There's always a way.

192
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,420
A good mood matters more

193
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,740
than anything else.

194
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,340
Don't forget to smile.

195
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
Just like what you are doing now.

196
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,220
Yes.

197
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,740
I'm off.

198
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,420
All right. Call me if you need anything.

199
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,300
Bye.

200
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,300
About these two things,

201
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,900
keep them a secret

202
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,780
and don't tell my dad.

203
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,340
I won't say anything
about your shoulder.

204
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,380
But isn't dating a good thing?

205
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:11,820
You...

206
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,260
I need to tell him myself.

207
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,540
Got it.

208
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm off.

209
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,420
Thanks, Dr. Lin.

210
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,660
Bye.

211
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,580
Bob,

212
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Shuwei,

213
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,700
Lu Nan,

214
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,660
Xue Shao,

215
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,340
and even Xing Mo

216
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,860
were all there,

217
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,100
but they chose Jia Fan?

218
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,580
That just doesn't make sense!

219
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,020
Why doesn't it make sense?

220
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,860
His height, looks,

221
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,460
charisma, or body proportions?

222
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,940
You don't get it.

223
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,180
What I'm talking about here

224
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,820
is status, reputation,

225
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,140
fame, and net worth

226
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,740
in our industry,

227
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,340
all right?

228
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,860
Even though this party

229
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,740
is private,

230
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,140
there's bound to be media, reporters,

231
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,100
and big names from the industry.

232
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,020
Someone like Yijing,

233
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,300
a top supermodel constantly
in the spotlight,

234
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,300
will undoubtedly be
the center of attention.

235
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,340
That's why

236
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,500
my stance is clear:

237
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,780
Either we don't go at all,

238
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,380
or we show up looking impeccable,

239
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,620
without a single flaw.

240
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,700
Wasn't Jia Fan your prized mentee?

241
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
Yesterday, he was your shining example,

242
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,860
yet today he's a flaw?

243
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,140
That just proves I keep work
and personal matters separate.

244
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,220
I consider protecting Yijing's interests

245
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,580
my top priority.

246
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,940
That's why I need to repay you

247
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,340
by bringing some business
to your training program.

248
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,140
At such an important event,

249
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,460
instead of seeking attention
with someone of equal status,

250
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm giving newcomers a chance.

251
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,380
Doesn't being so generous and selfless

252
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,860
make me an even better role model

253
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,820
and even more likable?

254
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,580
On second thought,

255
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,820
it actually makes for

256
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,140
quite a beautiful sight.

257
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
I have to hold back my charm.

258
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,980
I wouldn't want to steal your spotlight.

259
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,580
The experienced shows the ropes,

260
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,900
like a sister looking out
for her brother.

261
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,780
You're here.

262
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,260
Mo.

263
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,620
Then we...

264
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,540
You guys go ahead.

265
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,620
I'll head back on my own later.

266
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,260
Okay, we're leaving now.

267
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,860
Bye, Yijing.

268
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,780
Bye, Mo.

269
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,340
Bye.

270
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,780
[Hailiwang Seafood]
Jia Fan.

271
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,300
How could you do this?

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,220
We had a deal.

273
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,700
Once you become a model,

274
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,020
I'll be your personal stylist.

275
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
True, but I haven't become one yet.

276
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,260
Jia Fan!

277
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,660
It's just a party.

278
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,900
Besides,

279
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,460
my date is a big shot, so my only shot

280
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,620
at measuring up

281
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,020
is to nail the styling.

282
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,980
Otherwise, it'd be Beauty
and the Beast for real.

283
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,140
Who is it?

284
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,380
Tell me.

285
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,700
Who's this big shot?

286
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,900
Get back to work

287
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
and quit messing around.

288
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,060
Be confident.

289
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,420
No one in this world

290
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,100
is out of your league

291
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,900
unless it's Han Yijing.

292
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,140
Is it actually her?

293
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,340
So what if it's her?

294
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,860
"No one in this world
is out of your league", remember?

295
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,460
Quit daydreaming.

296
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,060
Stylist?

297
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,380
No stylist can help.

298
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,580
She's way out of your league.

299
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,500
By the way.

300
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,540
Jia Fan

301
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,300
asked me to thank you

302
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,780
for helping him out that day.

303
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,900
No worries.

304
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,980
Also...

305
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,300
he trusts you.

306
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,340
I take back what I said that day.

307
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,380
But you can't blame me.

308
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,740
You didn't say anything.

309
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,060
You like him,

310
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,740
and that's why you lost your cool.

311
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,380
I've never seen you that anxious,

312
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,620
not even about your own matters.

313
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,500
But let me remind you,

314
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,620
I'm not the only one who knows you well.

315
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,180
Your aunt does too.

316
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,300
If you can't fool me,

317
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,580
there's no way you can fool her.

318
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,180
So if you don't want history
to repeat itself,

319
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,980
be careful...

320
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,420
and keep it well hidden.

321
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,180
I know.

322
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,860
You got this.

323
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,700
Don't worry, Liu.

324
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,580
Your concern is my top priority.

325
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,500
It's all taken care of.

326
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,820
I really appreciate your support, Ling.

327
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,540
Without ACME backing us up,

328
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,460
I wouldn't even know
how to handle the situation.

329
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,500
Then the cover has to feature ACME,

330
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,300
or I'll be in a bind.

331
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,780
Ling,

332
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,180
you're really putting me
in a tough spot here.

333
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,140
I can only do my best,

334
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
but I can't guarantee anything.

335
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,580
I'm not the editor-in-chief, after all.

336
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,180
Then just tell me
who the editor-in-chief is.

337
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,140
That shouldn't be too hard, right?

338
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,420
That's the hardest part.

339
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,060
If I knew who the editor-in-chief was,

340
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,780
I'd be able to guarantee it.

341
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,260
All right.

342
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,020
Just ask around for me

343
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,700
and let me know
as soon as you hear anything.

344
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,100
No problem.

345
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,820
By the way, Ling...

346
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,460
Ms. Han Yijing

347
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,300
will definitely be there, right?

348
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,060
Of course.

349
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,020
Everyone on the list will be there.

350
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,260
All right.

351
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,780
Ling, I'll let you get back to work.

352
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,820
See you then.

353
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Okay. Bye.

354
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,940
All right. Bye.

355
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,340
It's confirmed.

356
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,340
She'll definitely be there.

357
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,820
And so will that Jia Fan.

358
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,940
We're about to meet at last.

359
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,220
Miss,

360
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,020
are you waiting for someone?

361
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,140
What are you doing?

362
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,220
You...

363
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,100
What's this all about?

364
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,580
I stuffed some stuff under my clothes.

365
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,540
My figure stands out too much.

366
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,940
Just hiding my face isn't enough.

367
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,780
Quick, help me hold this.

368
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,140
Good thinking, as always.

369
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
What's this for?

370
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,340
Since they all think
I'm not good enough for you,

371
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,380
I might as well highlight
the difference even more.

372
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,500
That way, even if they notice,

373
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,020

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,220
Surprisingly,
the kid's handling it well.

561
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,940
He's got potential.

562
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,820
No wonder
people are getting the wrong idea.

563
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,340
They do look well-matched today.

564
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,180
Look,

565
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,180
if your date today were Xing Mo,

566
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,100
people would probably misunderstand too.

567
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,700
What's going on?

568
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,500
Apparently, Xing Mo picked
this outfit for you.

569
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,660
As for why it has this effect,

570
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,420
that must be a coincidence.

571
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,980
The one in the blue jacket

572
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,180
is Dai Chengyi, a well-known stylist

573
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,060
in the industry.

574
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,100
He's very skilled,

575
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,340
but his personality is a bit eccentric.

576
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,420
He loves hearing compliments.

577
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Then he must like me.

578
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
That's why he doesn't like me.

579
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,900
See the one

580
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,620
in the purple outfit?

581
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,460
That's Aida.

582
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,380
She's a veteran scout

583
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,460
who loves poaching talents,

584
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,460
especially male models.

585
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,460
Uh-oh, should I be worried?

586
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,100
Except for someone like you.

587
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,420
What about that one?

588
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,340
Smile.

589
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,820
Hello, Yijing.

590
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,460
It's been a while.

591
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,940
It's been so long, Carrie.

592
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,860
We'll be seeing
each other a lot from now on.

593
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,860
I've launched a new business line,

594
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,940
so I might be working
with Ms. Ling quite often.

595
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,660
Sure thing.

596
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,140
Just reach out anytime
if you need anything.

597
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
You remind me
of your aunt back in the day.

598
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,100
And this is…?

599
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,620
This is Jia Fan,

600
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,620
the newest recruit

601
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,580
of ACME,

602
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,420
and maybe the next Xing Mo.

603
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,780
Han Jialing has a sharp eye for talent.

604
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,700
All right, have fun.

605
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,740
I won't disturb you any longer.

606
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,380
Take care of yourself.

607
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,140
You too.

608
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,900
Let me know if you ever need anything.

609
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,420
All right.

610
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,100
Isn't she that…?

611
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,700
Yup,

612
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,460
she's one of the best agents
in the modeling world,

613
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,020
having nurtured many top supermodels.

614
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,020
What?

615
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,180
Do you want to leave with her?

616
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,460
I wouldn't dare.

617
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,180
So, your arm's okay now?

618
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:30,820
Ms. Ling.

619
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm fine now.

620
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,220
A little rest will do the trick.

621
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,980
I'll make sure to go
to the hospital immediately next time.

622
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,660
Everyone here today
is aiming for the cover.

623
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,900
You're their biggest competitor,

624
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,620
so be mindful of what you say and do,

625
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,100
and most importantly,
avoid any form of interviews.

626
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,940
Don't worry.

627
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,300
I know how to stay professional.

628
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,940
Whim's team

629
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,700
kept asking if you'd be here,

630
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,620
so it's almost certain.

631
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,300
Just wait for the editor-in-chief
to show up.

632
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,500
They might announce it on the spot,

633
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,460
so be prepared.

634
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,900
Ms. Ling.

635
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,500
Anything else?

636
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,180
Who's the editor-in-chief?

637
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,260
I don't know.

638
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,780
Why do you care all of a sudden?

639
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,460
I thought you had zero interest in this.

640
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,340
I'm just a little curious

641
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,380
since we're about to work together.

642
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,220
I hope you stay this curious

643
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,860
instead of being indifferent

644
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,940
like before.

645
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,220
Forget I asked.

646
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,740
Looking for me?

647
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,220
I'm looking for You Ning.

648
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,220
You Ning?

649
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,740
I thought she was grounded by Ms. Ling.

650
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,540
That's why

651
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,700
we need to find her
before Ms. Ling does.

652
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,980
Given your relationship,

653
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,900
she's not going to listen to you.

654
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
If things get messy,

655
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,220
you might be implicated too.

656
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,780
Yes.

657
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,420
She only listens to Xing Mo.

658
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,060
Where's Xing Mo?

659
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,740
I'll go find him.

660
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,260
Let me do it.

661
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,180
Okay.

662
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,820
We'll soon find out.

663
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,460
Tina.

664
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,700
You Ning?

665
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,740
How come you are here?

666
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,580
The list...

667
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,180
That's why we can't let anyone find out.

668
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,300
Where's the editor-in-chief?

669
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,220
Tina, could you introduce me?

670
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,060
Don't worry, they'll be here soon.

671
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,260
I'll be right back.

672
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,260
Okay.

673
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,260
Looking for me?

674
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,380
Actually,

675
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,700
it's Ms. Han who's looking for you.

676
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,900
She saw You Ning,

677
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,020
but Ms. Ling hasn't noticed yet.

678
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,060
If you ever

679
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,260
need my help,

680
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,060
just tell me.

681
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,660
You helped me out again
during the last shoot.

682
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,260
We agreed

683
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,540
not to be sentimental.

684
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,260
I won't say much,

685
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,900
but I'll make sure to return the favor
when I get the chance.

686
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,620
You owe me more than just this one time.

687
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,660
That's why the offer never expires.

688
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,660
Then return the favor to Han Yijing.

689
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,620
I'm only doing this for her sake.

690
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,060
Treat her well.

691
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,540
Don't let anyone hurt her again,

692
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,700
including yourself.

693
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,140
Hello, everyone!

694
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Welcome

695
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,740
to the launch party of Whim China.

696
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,660
We are truly grateful
to have all of you here today.

697
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,900
It is because of you

698
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,580
that we can gather here in celebration.

699
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
It is because of you

700
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,100
that Whim China exists.

701
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,900
Your support
is what keeps us moving forward.

702
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,900
We hope you'll stand with us
in the future

703
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,940
as we strive

704
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,380
for excellence together.

705
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,180
Now, let's welcome

706
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,940
the star of the evening,

707
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,300
the much-anticipated
first editor-in-chief

708
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,020
of Whim China,

709
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,460
Leslie!

710
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,740
Hello, everyone. I'm Leslie.

711
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,260
First of all,

712
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,580
a special welcome
to all the industry elites here today.

713
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Thank you for attending
Whim China's launch event.

714
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,300
We all know

715
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,820
that Whim has achieved
incredible milestones in the past.

716
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,300
So

717
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
when I learned

718
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,100
that I would be

719
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,060
the first editor-in-chief of Whim China,

720
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,540
I understood

721
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,940
the weight of this responsibility.

722
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,900
But standing here today,

723
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,420
what I feel most is not pressure,

724
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,540
but joy.

725
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,540
Because I see

726
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,460
so many familiar faces.

727
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,940
It's been a while, my friends.

728
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,580
Okay.

729
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,820
That's enough from me.

730
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,740
Enjoy, everyone.

731
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,020
Long time no see.

732
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
You're just as beautiful as ever.

733
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,700
I spotted you right away.

734
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,540
You've aged quite a bit.

735
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,780
I barely recognized you.

736
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,020
And you're as sharp-tongued as ever.

737
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,460
I'm here today

738
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,860
for the launch party of Whim China,

739
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,020
not for a trip down memory lane.

740
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,860
We're privileged

741
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,060
to have you here.

742
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,940
On behalf of Whim,
I extend my warmest welcome

743
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,620
and look forward

744
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,180
to collaborating with you more

745
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,420
in the future.

746
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,940
Congratulations, Liao...

747
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,220
Leslie.

748
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,740
Meet

749
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,540
our latest recruit, a model

750
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,140
and my date for tonight.

751
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,300
I'm Jia Fan.

752
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,220
It's a pleasure to meet you.

753
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:47,940
Likewise.

754
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,260
We've met,

755
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,900
and I've shown the courtesy needed.

756
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,100
Now, if you'll excuse me.

757
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,540
Leaving so soon?

758
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,500
What about your partner?

759
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
We came together,
so of course, we'll leave together.

760
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,780
Thanks for the invite.

761
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,740
Till next time.

762
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,660
Why did she leave?

763
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,540
That's kind of rude.

764
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,260
Maybe the deal fell through.

765
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,980
Does that mean someone else
is getting the cover?

766
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,900
Feels like there's some untold grudge

767
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,700
involved.

768
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,340
Ms. Ling.

769
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,940
Ms. Ling.

770
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,300
Keep your cool.

771
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,540
Right now, you're not her aunt.

772
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,020
You're the founder of ACME.

773
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,500
There are so many people watching.

774
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,860
Don’t worry.

775
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,740
What you’re worried about won’t happen.

776
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,220
I'll talk to him.

777
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,060
Okay?

778
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,980
Ming,

779
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,500
take Ms. Ling back.

780
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,420
Leave this to me.

781
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,260
Let's go, Ms. Ling.

782
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,060
Ms. Ling left as well.

783
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,780
What happened to all of them?

784
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,700
What a nuisance.

785
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,420
Now those people are going
to start gossiping again.

786
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,060
Their staying
would just be a bigger nuisance.
