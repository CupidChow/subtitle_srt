Today, I'm going to be a judge,

3
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,940
so I can't dress too flashy.

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,860
It wouldn't be right
to steal the spotlight.

5
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,260
As for hairstyle,

6
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,620
"vibe beauty" is very popular right now.

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,900
The best way to achieve that

8
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,740
is to braid your hair after showering

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,780
let it loose the next day,

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,060
and your hair will look like mine.

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,060
As for makeup,

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,900
it should be as sophisticated
and natural as possible.

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,740
The best approach
is to focus on one feature,

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,180
like the eyebrows or lips.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,900
The truth is that last night,

she made us
spend an hour picking out a dress.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,980
Didn't she spend two hours
doing her makeup in advance as well?

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,180
Anyway,

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,740
everything should look natural.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,180
Remember, everyone,

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,220
your styling should match the environment.

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,580
Why are things in random places again?

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,660

You've been drinking?

192
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,340
Get me a plate of sashimi.

193

You're definitely drunk.

196
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
I've been drinking,

197
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,060
but I'm not drunk.

198
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,500
There are so many places
that sell sashimi,

199
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,540
why did you come to our place?

200
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,940
Besides,

201
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,420
it's dangerous to be out alone at night.

202
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,780
Sashimi!

203
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,540
We're closed.

204
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,100
Not selling.

205
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,380
Isn't the customer supposed to be God?

206
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,780
I'll complain about you.

207
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,220
Go ahead, complain.

208
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,860
Go on.

209
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,460
I gave up on my diet

210
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,460
and took a 20-km cab ride to get here.

211
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,340
Please sell me some sashimi.

212
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,860
It's fine.

213
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,940
You can sell me the most expensive one.

214
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,260
I can afford it.

215
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,300
Don't.

216
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,700
I'm a model.

217
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,380
I can stand.

218
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,220
Lobsters are good.

High in protein.

220
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,100
This one is good!

221
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,900
Don't touch it!

222
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,300
Bear with it.

223
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,820
I really don't know why you came here

224
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,100

I can't stand you.

229
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,660
I came to get that.

230
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,740
It had already been retracted

231
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,540
and it's out of print.

232
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,020
Why do you still have it?

233
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,540
Your makeup is smudging.

234
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,380
It's not because of that.

235
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,900
It really hurts.

236
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,260
That lobster pinched me so hard.

237
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,020
It hurts so much.

238
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:20,940

Wait here.

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,020
I'll go up and get it for you.

243

You're leaving me alone here?

244

That's not okay.

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,460
It's dark,

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,980
No, he isn't.

Where did I put it?

255
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,220
Take it.

Of course, I still

Never get involved
in any personal grudges.

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,540

363
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,740
But you're already 25.

364
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
You won't last long.

365
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,140
But you're 30.

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,740

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,420
What what?

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,940
You're not seeing me off?

378
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,460
It's dangerous for me to go back alone.

379
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,980
The threshold for the modeling industry
is really low.

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,660
As long as you have good genes,

381
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
a little training,

382
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,540
you can enter the industry.

383
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,740
But to stand out

384
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,300
is harder than reaching the sky.

385
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,340
Not only does your body have to endure,

386
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,620
your spirit has to be strong,

387
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,460
and you need enough good luck.

388
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,900
All three are indispensable.

389
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,580
How many people have endured for years

390
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
only to have to change careers
in the end.

391
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,100
But in the end,

392
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,340
being too tall

393
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,700
and having no professional skills,

394
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,260
you have to reset to factory settings,

395
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,180
start from zero.

396
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,180
You're always being chosen.

397
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,900
If you're not in an interview,

398
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,380
you're on your way to an interview.

399
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,180
Can't get sick, can't get injured.

400
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,380
Even if you're sick,

401
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,980
you can't say it.

402
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,740
Like me.

403
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,620
On the surface,

404
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,900
all glitz and glamour;

405
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,140
in reality,

406
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,340
fleeting and turbulent,

407
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,860
without any sense of security.

408
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,940
Then why do you work so hard?

409
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,300
Why didn't you change careers

410
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,300
after the accident?

411
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,260
If I changed careers like that,

412
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,380
I might as well die.

413
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,540
But heaven has been so good to me,

414
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,460
gave me such good genes and luck,

415
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,940
let me escape death.

416
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,380
How can I let it down?

417
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,700
That's what I think too.

418
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,500
But so many people have what you have.

419
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,740
As you just said,

420
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,340
there's also luck.

421
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,660
My luck is not ordinary.

422
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,580
What luck?

423
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,460
Meeting me?

424
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,060
Yes,

425
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,140
meeting you.

426
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,980
Narcissism is an illness,

427
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,020
needs treatment.

428
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,460
It's contagious.

429
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,900
Need to be treated together.

430
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,380
She

431
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,180
is that Han...

432
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,500
Han Yijing,

433
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,100
that model?

434
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,260
No.

435
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,380
She's her idol.

436
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,020
She always imitates her.

437
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,980
My daughter too,

438
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,460
always imitating her outfits and such.

439
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
Sir,

440
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,900
could you drive a bit slower?

441
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,060
Sure.

Do you have water?

452
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,900
Got any instant noodles?

453
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,140
Here.

454
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,700
I might as well die!

455
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,620
Hello.

456
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,300
My name is Li Chao.

457
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,780
Height, 191 cm.

458
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,980
Weight, 70 kg.

459
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,540
My measurements are 93,

460
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,220
65, 77.

461
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,140
Looking forward to working with you.

462
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,820
You drank?

463
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,060
When did you get here?

464
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,700
Last night,

465
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,380
you went out after 10 o'clock.

466
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,900
Private schedule.

467
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,460
Ms. Ling, I don't need to
report everything to you, do I?

468
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,300
No.

469
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,860
But as your aunt,

470
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,940
it's not wrong to worry
about my niece, is it?

471
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,700
You just made a comeback.

472
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,900
Many people are watching,

473
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,700
especially that Huang Jinde.

474
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,700
If he catches you again,

475
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,940
we'll never hear the end of it

476
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,300
Alright.

477
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,900
This is much more comfortable.

478
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,940
Ms. Ling should act like Ms. Ling.

479
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,660
During this time, prepare yourself well.

480
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,220
Rachel's product endorsement
should be yours this time.

481
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,860
Wasn't it always You Ning's?

482
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,260
Her contract has expired.

483
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,300
This time, Rachel's product positioning

484
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,580
fits your image perfectly.

485
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,940
What image?

486
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,220
The undefeated warrior?

487
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,460
Yes.

488
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,260
Positive,

489
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,100
healthy, energetic.

490
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,420
Not doing it.

491
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,740
Can't go.

492
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,180
Why can't you go?

493
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,980
They specifically want you.

494
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,380
You know full well

495
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,500
I don't get along with You Ning

496
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,620
and you still want me
to take her endorsement?

497
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,220
Please understand

498
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,700
that we're Party B,

499
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,620
we can't control Party A's thoughts.

500
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,180
And as a company,

501
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,700
we can't trade a deal in the millions

502
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,220
for your sisterly affection.

503
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,540
You have no reason to refuse.

504
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,900
Before signing, get your health in order.

505
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,740
Drink less.

506
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,260
Spend more time worrying about

507
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,780
guiding the new recruits.

508
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,660
Wu Ming wants you

509
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,020
to teach the classes on fashion.

510
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,420
The selection list is out?

511
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,300
Almost.

512
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,340
If nothing unexpected happens,

513
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,540
it'll be announced in a couple of days.

514
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,340
How unexpected.

515
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,820
You were so against Jia Fan competing

516
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,020
and so strict to him
during the interview.

517
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,300
Yet, you gave him such a high score.
