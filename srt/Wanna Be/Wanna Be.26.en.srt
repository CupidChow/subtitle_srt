Someone must be behind this.

194
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,720
I agree.

195
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,910
Or it wouldn't have spread this fast

196
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,080
in such a short time.

197
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,270
The reviews are lopsided.

198
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,320
And they're all negative.

199
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
[Xing Mo]

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,720
She's awake.

201
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,790
She's fine.

202
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,440
Guys,

203
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,510
because of this case,

204
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,320
we're in a huge mess.

205
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,960
I believe ACME is in a bigger mess.

206
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,390
At this moment,

207
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,840
instead of troubling each other,

208
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,960
we should do our jobs

209
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,000
and solve our own problems.

210
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
I believe Ms. Ling

211
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,000
will try her best to save ACME.

212
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,240
Let's do four things.

213
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,320
First,

214
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,750
we'll pick another topic

215
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,030
excluding ACME.

216
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,030
Second,

217
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
send a lawyer's letter in my own name

218
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,670
about Han Yijing and me.

219
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,480
All the posts

220
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,960
about colluding,

221
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,510
cheating, or getting back together

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
are slanders.

223
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,510
If people make rumors again,

224
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,240
they'll be sued.

225
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,080
Third,

226
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,440
post a statement in Whim's name.

227
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,750
Business is business.

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,630
Whim has nothing to do

229
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,790
with my privacy.

230
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,870
Fourth,

231
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,550
contact the advertisers

232
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,750
and give them offers

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,440
until they're satisfied.

234
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,870
Stop pacing.

235
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm dizzy.

236
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,150
Mo,

237
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,750
what do you think

238
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,960
of her problem?

239
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,320
It'll be gone in a few days.

240
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,910
But the problem is...

241
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,270
What is it?

242
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,910
She really has a problem.

243
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,670
But luckily,

244
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,240
she was prepared for a while.

245
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,390
So...

246
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,000
What she wants is a happy ending.

247
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,320
Not such a mess.

248
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,080
No way.

249
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,150
I don't approve!

250
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,150
Han Yijing,

251
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,840
you should be responsible,

252
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,240
but not in this way.

253
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,000
Ms. Ling.

254
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,480
Calm down, please.

255
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,200
Yijing, you calm down too.

256
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,750
Tell us

257
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,200
and we'll solve it together.

258
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,120
How?

259
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,320
It's my own problem!

260
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,630
Now you know you're wrong, huh?

261
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,960
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,030
If you had told me,

263
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,510
things wouldn't end up like this.

264
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,840
And the two of you!

265
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,240
How dare you lie to me?

266
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,440
It's not their fault.

267
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,270
I forced them.

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,510
Ms. Ling,

269
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
she didn't tell you

270
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
because you would stop her.

271
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,360
So...

272
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,870
So, I disapproved.

273
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,310
At this point,

274
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,480
you have to keep this going.

275
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,680
If she could,

276
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,480
this wouldn't have happened.

277
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,270
Aunt.

278
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,880
Just do what I told you.

279
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,480
I really can't pretend anymore.

280
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
Put me out of this, please.

281
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,640
This is also the last thing

282
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,830
I can do for ACME.

283
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,200
Okay?

284
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,720
I beg you.

285
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,640
Hello.

286
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,110
You just rest and get well.

287
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,750
Watch her.

288
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,680
Ms. Ling.

289
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,590
Ms. Ling.

290
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,640
Where is she going?

291
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't know.

292
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,200
She has been handling this

293
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,070
and barely slept.

294
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,590
She just left the hospital.

295
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,070
What if...?

296
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,920
You take care of this.

297
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,790
I'll go check on her.

298
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,880
Han Jialing!

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,920
Stop hesitating.

300
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,200
Or it'll be too late.

301
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,790
Will you really quit?

302
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,200
Yes.

303
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,350
She'll leave the runway.

304
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,440
ACME will post a statement

305
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,200
to disassociate.

306
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,880
She'll pose a statement,

307
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,070
saying it's all her fault

308
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,880
and she lied to ACME and everybody.

309
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,790
She'll pay for all the losses

310
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,480
and take full responsibility.

311
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,070
It's just a fact.

312
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,440
But if you post that,

313
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
you'll lose everything

314
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
you've fought for
including your image and reputation.

315
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,310
If I don't say anything

316
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,030
or just tell sad stories,

317
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,790
I'll be cursed more

318
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,680
and even lose more.

319
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,350
Yijing.

320
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,110
Whether you approve,

321
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,070
I will do this.

322
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,640
And you know very well

323
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,590
it's the best
and the most effective way.

324
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
It's the only solution too.

325
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,400
I'll be cursed, so what?

326
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,830
I won't check my phone.

327
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,110
I'll just bear it for a few days.

328
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,400
But it's different for ACME.

329
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,160
Once it takes my side,

330
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,350
its reputation will be gone.

331
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,880
It'll never rise again.

332
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,750
Huang Jinde!

333
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,510
What on earth do you want?

334
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,240
Would you stop it?

335
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,310
Don't be so angry.

336
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,680
You're the boss.

337
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,440
Be decent.

338
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,960
Rogue.

339
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,510
Then what are you?

340
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,240
Liars?

341
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm warning you.

342
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,240
Stop right here.

343
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,550
If you dare...

344
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,270
I know you're powerful.

345
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,310
Were it not for you,

346
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,510
I wouldn't have been fired,

347
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,920
blacklisted,

348
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,880
and ruined.

349
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,200
However,

350
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,830
things are different.

351
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,310
Now,

352
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,680
I've learned

353
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,200
to use facts and reason things out.

354
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,160
So,

355
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,720
this isn't slander.

356
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,070
I have photos as proof.

357
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,440
No wonder you've been haunting us.

358
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,400
So, you've been dredging up the past.

359
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,110
Exactly.

360
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,510
This is

361
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,000
an eye for an eye.

362
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,400
I did all those things alone.

363
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,030
Han Yijing isn't involved.

364
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,550
But she's your Achilles' heel.

365
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,550
You only care about her.

366
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,270
Glad you know that.

367
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,830
Huang Jinde.

368
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,720
You have no more things on us, huh?

369
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,000
You won't have any either.

370
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,510
You'd better stop before it's too late.

371
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,480
Or I won't let you go.

372
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,550
Spring Bud International Kindergarten.

373
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,030
Does it sound familiar?

374
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,030
What a surprise.

375
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,310
The famous Han Yijing

376
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,720
was abandoned

377
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,880
by her own mother.

378
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,480
Really tragic.

379
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,030
Don't worry.

380
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,070
I won't tell others.

381
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,960
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

382
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,310
Scoundrel!

383
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,000
Let me go.

384
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,270

You can't reason out with such a rascal.

The more you care,
the more excited he'll be.

Only your confession

These aren't big problems.

I know you want to protect Yijing.

447
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,310
But ACME is our priority.

448
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,720
We can't protect her

ruin herself.

575
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,720
Neither can I.

576
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,590
After all,

577
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,030
it's my fault.

578
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,310
So, you have to help me.

579
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,240
I don't help you just because of her.

580
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,880
She wouldn't approve.

581
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,750
Revealing your problem
can divert some attention,

582
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,160
but it's only temporary.

583
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,270
And it's risky.

584
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,920
If someone uses it against you,

585
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,400
you'll have a lose-lose game.

586
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,310
Then ACME will be totally ruined.
