00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,180
Mr. Xing,

3
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,460
what a coincidence.

4
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,500
Did Ms. Ling ask for you too?

5
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,660
What did she tell you?

6
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,180
Did she ask you and me to...

7
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,140
She didn't ask for me.

8
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,340
Who were you going to then?

9
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,780
And you brought food.

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,740
What's with that manner?

11
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,060
You've been treating me so unfriendly.

12
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,300
Was it because I took Jia Fan's side
and not yours?

13
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,700
Thank you very much

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,380
and keep up the good work.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,180
Enough with the sarcasm, okay?

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,580
In the end,

17
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,900
you have no one to blame but yourself.

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,380
You waited and waited,
being more nice than wise.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,100
Now you have to go all out

20
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,060
or you won't get any job.

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,780
Ms. Ling is not going
to drop you again, is she?

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,820
Impossible.

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,700
I've made myself behave recently

24
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,940
and I didn't mess with Han Yijing.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,900
Listen,

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,220
no matter what she says,

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,300
just play along.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,460
Save any problems for later.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,940
She's been so annoyed by Jia Fan,

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,100
so don't make yourself her target.

31
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,980
Got it.

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,220

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,180
No.

34
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,100
Absolutely no.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,620
You Ning,

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,260
we all agree

37
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,420
this is the best choice for you now.

38
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,660
It's not for me at all.

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm a model and you're asking me to act

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,220
and be an actress?

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,460
You're naturally vibrant

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,540
and photogenic.

43
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,300
You also have
infectious facial expressions, right?

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,100
No.

45
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,220
Still no.

46
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,140
That's two different things.

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,060
Just give it a try.

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,460
You've got nothing to lose.

49
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,580
We can talk if this doesn't work.

50
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
What if it works?

51
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,740
I'll have too many offers in acting

52
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,060
which leaves me no time for modeling.

53
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,660

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,180
I can change my style

55
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,180
but I can't change my career path.

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,220
The more characters I take,

57
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,620
the vaguer my personal image will be.

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,740
No brands will book me.

59
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,380
No brands want you already.

60
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,460
And they won't want you anymore.

61
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,220
You tried to get more endorsement fees
from Rachel in private

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,420
and wrecked the party.

63
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,580
These have spread out in the industry.

64
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,380
Luckily, you aren't having
any business cooperation

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,500
or we'll have to face penalties.

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,260
Stop being picky.

67

You have no choice.

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,620
Yeah.

69

This is only temporary.

an acting teacher for you

77

Do you not want Jia Fan back

118

or want to send me away?

119

Hi?

191
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,740
What?

192
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,060
It's been a long time.

193
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,180
Would you like to grab a drink?

194
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,940
Cut it out.

195
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,060

196
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,260

198

Han Yijing, Jia Fan,

199
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,140
and Mr. Liao

200
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,060
were in three different lines of work.

201
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,100
They were good at their jobs back
when they were separate.

202
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,780
When they came together,

203
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,900
they not only broke the sales record

204
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,940
but also made an eye-catching drama.

205
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,340
The ex that returned in triumph.

206
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,380
The current
that turned adversity into success.

207
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,060
Isn't it thrilling

208
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,340
and interesting?

209
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,100
What?

210
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,180
I'm warning you.

211
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,420
I'll report you if you mess things up.

212
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,060
Wait,

213
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,580
we're on the same side, aren't we?

214
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,900
You came to me at the beginning.

215
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,980
The past is the past.

216
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,340
Now we aren't.

217
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,740
What about now?

218
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,220
I regret it, okay?

219
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,180
I'm telling you.

220
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,220
If you dare to hurt Liao...

221

Han Yijing,

222
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,860
I won't let you off.

223
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,420
You know me.

224
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,020
No one can stop me
when I'm set on something.

225
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,420
You do change your mind quickly.

226
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,820
Fine, forget what I say.

227

What about you?

235

Are you staying?

236

It's the weekend.

237
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,380
Give yourself some time to relax.

238
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,100
Being too intense
is bad for your health.

239
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,060
I've been like this
for more than a decade.

240
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,580
I'm used to it.

241
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,460
It won't hurt me.

[Han Jialing: Don't wait up.]

247
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,180
Evenings aren't the time
for coffee, are they?

248
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,100
Let me.

249
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,220
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

250

Why are you here?

251
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,340
I've made myself clear.

252
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,500
You didn't go there

253
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,820
so I had to come.

254
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,820
I've got to give you the present

255
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,660

No.

260
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
This is not just a present.

261
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,500
It represents

262
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,540

Thank you

264
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,860
for guiding me into this industry.

265
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,900
It took me a year to get it ready.

266
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,380
Take a look at least.

267
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,860
I designed it myself.

268
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,820
Hope you like it.

269
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,300
Are you sure

270
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,460
this kind of dress fits me?

271
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,860
Sure.

272
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,060
It's customized for you.

273
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,180
It reveals

274
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,860
how little you know about me.

275
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,900
You know too little about yourself.

276
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,140

277

Don't waste your time on me.

279
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,140
I have found that person six years ago.

280
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,380
I just didn't find
the chance to tell her.

281
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,860
In this world,

282
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,380
this dress fits no one but her.

283
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,740
Have you heard?

284
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,380
Ms. Ling and the guy called Xing Mo.

285
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,500
Isn't it obvious?

286
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,380
A newbie with zero experience

287
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,620
got so many jobs

288
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,060
as soon as he joined the company.

289
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,860
Why? Because the boss likes him.

290
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,300
How shameless.

291
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,580
She's so old.

292
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
Not surprising.

293
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,500
It's kind of a cooperation,

294
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,860
taking what they want from each other.

295
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,340
We didn't do anything.

296
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,860
We were just doing the number one.

297
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,620
He didn't say anything

298
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,940
but rushed in

299
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
and punched us hard.

300
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Yeah, Ms. Ling.

301
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,540
We're having a photo shoot this weekend.

302
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,660
How are we going to do it

303
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,860
with our faces like this?

304
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,620
How are we going to tell the clients?

305
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,900
Right.

306
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,740
He can't get away with it easily.

307
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,540
The fact is the fact.

308
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,220
You must give us justice.

309
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,300
Yes, Ms. Ling.

310
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,980
He had an issue with us a long time ago,

311
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,060
and now he's chosen this moment
to act on it.

312

No.

491
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,820
I quit eating sugar.

492
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,340
Good choice.

493
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,540
I imagined numerous situations
of you coming here.

494
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,100
But tonight is beyond my imagination.

495
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,380
It's the best scenario.

496
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,420
I wished I hadn't forgotten.

497
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,540
We can make it.

498
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,540

499

503
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,140
Extra numbing and spicy, please.

504
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,220
Sorry.

505
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,820
I did it without your consent.

506
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,780

507

508
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,140
I won't do it again.

509

Smile a little.

510
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,460
It won't happen again.

511
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,460
What...

512
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,380
did I do wrong again?

513
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,460
Should it be "I'll do better next time"

514
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,060
instead of "I won't do it again"?

515
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,580
You're getting thick-skinned.

516
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,340
Don't hang out with Jia Fan too often.

517
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,180
Don't misunderstand him.

519

I'm not hungry.

526
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,540

527
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,420
What a waste of time.

528
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,100
Don't eat it then.

529
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,980
Just drink. There's more than enough.

530

532
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,220
Time to eat.

533
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,940
What a feast.

534
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,500
Well...

535
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,020
This is my humble cooking.

536
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,900
Try them out.

537

All of you.

538

Have a bite.

539
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
The tofu tastes like braised pork.

540
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,860
Is it?

541
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,260
So good.

542
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,580
Are you sure this is an egg

543
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,420
not a fish ball?

544
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,100
Amazing.

Your cooking is so good.

547
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,060
It's a shame you didn't become a chef.

548
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,060
No, it isn't.

549
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,140
I can use it for other occasions.

550
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,620
You're right though.

551
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,620
More delicious food
will be waiting for you.

552
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,020
If Ms. Ling wants to eat what I cook,

553
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,020
I will be at your service.

554
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,540
Why don't you be a chef instead?

555
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,740
It suits you.

556
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,860
You stopped me, didn't you?

557
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,500
You said being a model
suited me the best.

558
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,300
I didn't see this coming.

559
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,620
C'est la vie.

560
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,140
Unexpected

561
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,700
but reasonable.

562
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,260
Life is about winning and losing.

563
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,740
Birthdays
