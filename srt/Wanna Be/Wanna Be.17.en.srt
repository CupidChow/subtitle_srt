[Wanna Be]

2
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,560
Mr. Wu,

3
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
what do you want to talk to me about?

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,200
Please just say it.

5
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,070
Don't hold back.

6
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,040
Nothing.

7
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,000
Just chitchat.

8
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,950
Okay, you start then.

9
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,790
Fan,

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,230
who do you think

11
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,280
treats you the best in ACME?

12
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
Of course, Ms. Ling.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,950
If it weren't for her...

14
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,070
Besides Ms. Ling.

15
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,790
Mo?

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Shubo?

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,200
You?

18
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,310
It's Han Yijing.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,950
All these years,

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,510
I've never seen her care
about anyone so much.

21
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,680
Even more than herself.

22
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,280
From Rachel's ad

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,310
to Whim's cover,

24
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,960
she handles everything herself.

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,280
I heard

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,630
she gave you the highest score

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,470
during the competition.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,470
Clearly, she has...

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,470
exceptionally...

30
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,310
high expectations...

31
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,910
for you.

32
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,840
I don't know why you're here.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
And I don't want to know.

34
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,910
But I hope we don't
see each other again.

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
And if we do, we're strangers.

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,470
No acknowledgment.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,750
And no behind-the-scenes gestures.

38
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,150
Okay?

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,430
I've always wanted to talk to you.

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,750
There's nothing to talk about.

41
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,240
Our story ended three years ago.

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,470
And I have a boyfriend now.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm not the kind of person

44
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
to sneak around with an ex
while in a relationship.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,150
Please know your place.

46
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,710
Your boyfriend

47
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,750
wouldn't happen to be Jia Fan, would it?

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,080
You two have known each other
for less than half a year.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,240
Do you think half a year...

50
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,470
He is my boyfriend.

51
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,800
We started dating before you came back.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,630
You're lucky to have a mentor
like Yijing.

53
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,310
You'll have plenty of opportunities.

54
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,960
Yeah.

55
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,030
Mr. Wu,

56
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,960
please stop beating around the bush.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,680
I need to go back for extra training.

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,360
Whim has replied.

59
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,080
They've decided on a duo cover,

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
you and Yijing.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,920
I heard about the cover.

62
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,720
Regardless of whether it was your idea,

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
I appreciate it.

64
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,310
So you're doing it?

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,240
Of course.

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,310
It's such a great opportunity.

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,510
You don't really care.

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,950
No matter how good the opportunity is,

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,120
if it involves me,

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
you'd never agree,

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,720
let alone working with me, right?

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,430
So you're doing this

73
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,800
just to make me refuse,

74
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,390
and drag Jia Fan into it,

75
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,430
so he'll blame me?

76
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,630
I just want to know

78
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,680
if he's serious about you.

79
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,800
None of your business.

80
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,560
Logically,

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
this should be a good thing.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,870
But Yijing...

83
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,600
I can't do it.

84
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,270
Can't?

85
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,630
Why?

86
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,720
I've ridden her coattails enough.

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,560
Let's skip this one.

88
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,870
Thanks for the coffee.

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,630
I'll head back.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm afraid you'll be deceived.

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm okay with it.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,950
Han Yijing,

93
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
a rookie with no money or influence

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,630
has to use certain tactics

95
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,750
to get ahead.

96
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,830
Like you did, right?

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,950
People see others

98
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,720
the way they see themselves.

99
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,160
Liao Jinyuan,

100
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
I know why you left

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,190
and why

102
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,430
you're back now.

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,600
Your apology is noted.

104
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,920
But I won't forgive you.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
Never.

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,240
Because what you destroyed
wasn't just those three years.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,190
So if you really feel guilty,

108
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,430
just do as I say.

109
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,830
Keep it strictly business.

110
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
No more tests.

111
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,070
And don't cause trouble for Jia Fan.

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,830
Or I'll do whatever it takes.

113
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,630
You know that.

114
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,240
Han Yijing.

115
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,510
You have until Friday

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
to decide about the cover.

117
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,630
I'll convince Ms. Ling.

[Episode 17]
[Showdown]

119
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,000
This bidding process
was a real challenge.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,630
Stay sharp.

121
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,800
We can't drop the ball.

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
Relax.

123
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,070
It's not an international supermodel.

124
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,510
Not now.

125
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,800
But who knows in the future?

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Take this one, for example.

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,430
She's a rising star
with great potential.

128
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,360
I have high hopes for her too.

129
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,950
She's been on a roll

130
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,360
since she debuted.

131
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,360
She'll definitely be the ace of ACME.

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,040
So,

133
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,190
nail this shoot,

134
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,750
and we'll be set.

135
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,720
Turn around.

136
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,240
Good.

137
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,360
Come on.

138
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:31,870
Alright.

139
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,800
Very good.

140
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,310
Be confident.

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,040
Right.

142
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,560
Let it out.

143
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,070
Yes.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,270
Well-done.

145
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
Keep going.

146
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,920
Good.

147
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,430
Let me.

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,190
Spin.

149
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,270
Come on.

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,030
Here, warm water.

151
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,870
Thanks.

152
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,960
No, I'm good. You sit.

153
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,320
Why don't you go to the lounge?

154
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,670
It's a bit stuffy in there.

155
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,240
So I came out to get some fresh air.

156
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,600
No rush then.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
We can start

158
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
when you're ready.

159
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,750
You models

161
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,550
but only you know the real deal.

162
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Of course,

163
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
we photographers know that too.

164
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,790
Sorry.

165
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm not feeling very well today.

166
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,550
So,

167
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,630
I think...

168
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,480
Seriously?

169
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,510
You're not feeling well?

170
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,670
But you still nailed it.

171
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,030
You're amazing.

172
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,630
Thanks.

173
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,910
Oh, right.

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
This.

176
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,750

179
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,360
Why do you carry this around?

180
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,150
Just in case we need to

181
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
shoot outdoors in the cold

195
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,960
and you ended up
taking her as your girlfriend.

196
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
Now that's what I call efficiency!

197
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,670
Tell me about it.

198
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,440
That's skill.

199
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,320
Take notes, people.

200
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Oh, come on.

201
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,960
Without our advice,

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
would you have bet on the right horse?

203
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,390
Level with us,

204
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,120
are you really into Han Yijing,

205
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,750
or just using her to climb up?

206
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
Isn't that obvious?

207
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,790
It's normal for photographers
to ride models' coattails.

208
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,120
Jinyuan has finally made it.

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,550
Why would he settle for just one?

210
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,390
Exactly. Think bigger.

211
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,670
Play the long game.

212
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,600
Enough talk.

213
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's drink.

214
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
What do you mean?

215
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,750
Are you threatening me?

216
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,320
Since she won't listen to me,

217
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,150
I had to come to you.

218
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,550
Talking to me won't help.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,550
That was a year ago.

220
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,510
And I was just bragging.

221
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,240
I was drunk...

222
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,960
No need to explain.

223
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,750
It doesn't matter if she believes it.

224
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,390
If I release this,

225
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,720
you're both finished.

226
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
I told you

227
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,320
she's on the rise.

228
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,840
Don't mess with her

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,030
or distract her.

230
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,840
She's your family,

231
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
not your commodity.

232
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,120
That's why I can't just watch her
throw herself into a dumpster fire!

233
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,200
I...

234
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,870
I... I'm sincere about her.

235
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,550
I'm planning our future.

236
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,790
Then leave her.

237
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,790
Or I'll release the recording,

238
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,670
make her a laughingstock
in the industry,

239
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,790
and ruin her.

240
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
And ruin you.

241
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,750
ACME rejected us.

242
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,200
They didn't even give a reason.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,150
Should we activate Plan B?

244
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,960
Wait a little longer.

245
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,750
They'll agree.

246
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,270
Not bad. Professional.

247
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,270
Of course.

248
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,150
We take pride in our work.

249
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,030
So you dress like this?

250
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,200
Are you happier here

251
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
than you were at ACME?

252
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,030
I'm telling you,

253
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,080
don't try to trap me.

254
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm not that cunning.

255
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,270
Unlike...

256
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm just straightforward.

257
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,150
This place

258
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,000
is basically ACME's

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
reject club.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
Terminated contracts,

261
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,440
pending terminations,

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
and one

263
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,670
in progress.

264
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,790
Tell me

265
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,270
when your ban will be lifted.

266
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,790
I don't want to
keep working with you here.

267
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Relax. This isn't a shelter.

268
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,440
Mo.

269
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,000
Mo.

270
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,080
Spend more, gossip less.

271
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,600
Heard that?

272
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:20,910
Gossip less.

273
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,910
He means you.

274
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,790
Mo.

275
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,390
Can you stop lecturing me?

276
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,840
I've lost everything.

277
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,630
I only have you now.

278
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,120
If you had known
it'd turn out like this,

279
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,600
would you still have fallen for him?

280
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,030
If you hadn't,

281
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,440
you wouldn't have fallen out
with Han Yijing,

282
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
lost your job,

283
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,510
or been suffering like this now.

284
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,670
Yes, I would.

285
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,630
If I hadn't fallen for him,

286
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,080
I would've been a mess six years ago.

287
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,150
He gave me motivation.

288
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,550
He made me want to be better.

289
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,000
I know I'm being a hopeless romantic

290
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,600
and that others might look down on me.

291
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,840
But no one has ever

292
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,510
loved me my whole life.

293
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,390
If I don't love others desperately,

294
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,510
how can I keep going?

295
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,790
Then keep loving,

296
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,030
regardless of the outcome.

297
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,120
If that old crush

298
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,150
was about making yourself better,

299
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,150
then

300
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,720
why self-destruct now?

301
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,150
Mo.

302
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,870
So, you can't be greedy...

303
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,480
when it comes to love.

304
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,790
If you expect nothing in return...

305
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,270
it won't hurt this much.

306
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,200
You're supporting me?

307
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,960
Not exactly.

308
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,080
Is it because you're
thinking of Han Yijing?

309
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,870
My situation is different.

310
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,000
Han Yijing is already taken.

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
When she was with Jinyuan,

312
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,150
I... I never confessed to him.

313
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,750
I have my principles.

314
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
Hello?

315
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,750
Go ahead.

316
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,960
What's the relationship
between Han Yijing and Jia Fan?

317
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,590
Jia Fan refused the cover shoot.

318
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,350
His reason was

319
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,830
that he didn't want to
ride Han Yijing's coattails.

320
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,110
Obviously nonsense.

321
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,480
I just can't figure it out.

322
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,400
From his perspective,

323
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,270
there's no reason to refuse.

324
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,550
Unless...

325
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,510
Ms. Ling.

326
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,160
You're close with them,

327
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,550
so I came to ask you.

328
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,790
Tell me the truth.

329
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,110
What's their relationship?

330
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,830
Mentor and mentee.

331
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
Also friends.

332
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,830
To put it bluntly,
it's a matter of pride.

333
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,310
If I were him,

334
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,440
I'd refuse too.

335
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,590
Alright.

336
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,030
Hope that's all it is.

337
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,070
This is the first time you've called me

338
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,440
at night.

339
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,000
But I got all excited for nothing.

340
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,070
I owe you one.

341
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
After all, this isn't work-related.

342
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,830
It's personal.

343
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,590
So, how do you plan to repay me?

344
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,480
You tell me.

345
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,920
Give You Ning another chance.

346
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,400
She's going to ruin herself.

347
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,270
She's drinking every day

348
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,960
and not doing anything serious.

349
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,640
Okay.

350
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
You agreed?

351
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,640
I was planning to give her some space

352
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,790
before bringing her back.

353
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,640
Since you two are together,

354
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,880
just tell her

355
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,720
to come to the office tomorrow.

356
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,240
Got it.

357
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,000
How did you know we're together?

358
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,510
Ms. Ling, she agreed to the cover shoot.

359
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,590
I didn't say anything.

360
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,270
No idea how she found out.

361
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,400
She volunteered

362
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
and was very insistent.

363
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,750
♪My heart is waiting♪

364
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,070
♪My heart is waiting♪

365
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,270
♪Living happily every day♪

366
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,160
♪Always waiting♪

367
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,400
♪Waiting, waiting♪

368
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,720
Why are you
sitting in the dark like that?

369
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,310
Trying to scare someone?

370
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,790
Why did you come here so late?

371
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,110
I thought you had a photoshoot.

372
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,070
Yeah.

373
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
I finished.

374
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,960
I came back to get something.

375
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,920
So did Han...

376
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,070
Did Ms. Han go back?

377
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,200
She did.

378
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,480
She was so exhausted.

379
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
She didn't say a word the whole way.

380
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,240
That's why they say,

381
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,720
"Heavy is the head
that wears the crown."

382
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,510
Just like you.

383
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,200
You're still here training.

384
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,030
Impressive.

385
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,750
I'm just a slow learner
trying to catch up.

386
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,750
Well, keep going,

387
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,590
and you might just make it to the top.

388
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,070
What?

389
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,480
When that happens,

390
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,240
don't you dare forget your mentor, me.

391
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,000
Wait.

392
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
I can't believe

393
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,310
how fast you're rising.

394
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,550
What do you mean by that?

395
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,270
Still playing dumb?

396
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,110
You're shooting a cover with Han Yijing.

397
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,480
That's "making it to the top".

398
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,440
That's a Whim cover.

399
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,550
Once the magazine comes out,

400
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,550
I'm telling you,
your exposure will skyrocket.

401
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,880
She agreed?

402
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,790
Of course.

403
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,000
You should be thrilled.

404
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,400
Remember how you came to me,

405
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,590
out of breath,

406
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,020
begging me to mentor you?

407
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,100
Wait, I'm not finished.

408
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,740
You should know
how to show gratitude, kid.

409
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,820
[Hailiwang]

410
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,260
Liao Jinyuan.

411
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,860
What a coincidence.

412
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,140
What are you doing here?

413
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,140
Visiting my daughter.

414
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,980
Your daughter?

415
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,580
Yeah.

416
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,980
The cat we raised together.

417
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,820
Her name is Leica.

418
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,460
She didn't even tell you?

419
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,100
I don't care about your cat.

420
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
I'm warning you,

421
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,340
stay away from her.

422
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,580
Or you'll regret it.

423
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,220
And who are you to warn me?

424
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,940
As her partner?

425
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,020
Her junior?

426
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,980
Or her boyfriend?

427
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,020
If you're nothing to her,

428
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,700
save the tough-guy act.

429
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm telling you,

430
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,900
if it weren't for her,

431
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,660
I wouldn't have gone
to that stupid interview.

432
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,020
Don't think being a chief editor

433
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,940
makes you somebody.

434
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,060
Drop the act.

435
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,740
You jerk.

436
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,580
Who do you think you are?

437
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,700
You don't deserve her.

438
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,340
Hitting me, huh?

439
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,220
Violent tendency.

440
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,140
I'll tell Han Yijing.

441
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,780
I'm hitting

442
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,220
a scumbag like you
who won't leave her alone.

443
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,140
Who are you calling a scumbag?

444
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,540
Is this how ACME

445
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,820
trains you? To fight?

446
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,740
None of your business.

447
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,060
What are you doing?

448
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,500
Why are you fighting?

449
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,540
Which unit are you from?

450
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,740
Show me your IDs.

451
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,900
We don't live here.

452
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Then why are you here?

453
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,180
Looking for someone?

454
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,420
Call them down then.

455
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,380
No.

456
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,100
Well, it's a misunderstanding.

457
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,340
We know each other.

458
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,380
We were just messing around.

459
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,260
Right?

460
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,180
Messing around?

461
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,540
Just look at your bruises.

462
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,660
Call now.

463
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,020
Please don't.

464
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,660
It's so late. No need to bother anyone.

465
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,700
Look, sir.

466
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,780
We had a bit of a disagreement.

467
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,660
You know

468
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,460
how it is with guys.

469
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,860
A fight clears the air.

470
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,180
But you're absolutely right.

471
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,660
Violence is never the answer.

472
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,580
We were wrong.

473
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,420
Please

474
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,300
forgive us.

475
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Right?

476
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,460
Yes, absolutely.

477
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,740
Hello?

478
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,780
What's the matter?

479
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,020
I was just in the shower.

480
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,500
Just wanted to check if you got home.

481
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,980
I was shooting all day
and was pretty tired,

482
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,300
so I didn't go to you.

483
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,780
No worries.

484
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,020
Get some rest.

485
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,580
Okay.

486
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,660
Goodnight.

487
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,980
As long as no one's hurt.

488
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,060
Right?

489
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Yeah, absolutely.

490
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,660
Young people can be impulsive.

491
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,220
Yes.

492
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,780
Especially nowadays.

493
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,700
Just say what you want.

494
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,700
I don't have time to drink with you.

495
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Then we'll drink separately.

496
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,980
No point wasting the liquor.

497
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,540
You're the first person I've met

498
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,060
with thicker skin than me.

499
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,300
Gotta be like that

500
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,860
to pursue Han Yijing.

501
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,020
Don't you dare

502
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,260
say her name.

503
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,860
You're right.

504
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,580
I'm a jerk.

505
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,620
Never should've gotten involved
with her.

506
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,420
I gave her light,

507
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,020
then pushed her into darkness.

508
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,340
I'm a terrible guy.

509
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,660
Let me tell you,

510
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,100
Han Yijing is...

511
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,780
She's actually...

512
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,260
She...

513
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,300
She...

514
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,340
She's all bark and no bite.

515
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,140
She seems tough

516
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,500
and hard to deal with,

517
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,340
but...

518
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,420
but she's really naive.

519
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,940
Just keep

520
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,020
being good to her,

521
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,700
and she'll

522
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,860
give you her heart and soul.

523
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,820
People like that

524
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,420
get taken advantage of easily.

525
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,500
Are you

526
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,700
serious about her?

527
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,300
None of your business.

528
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,340
Well, as someone who's been there,

529
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,180
let me give you some advice

530
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,740
and share some...

531
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,980
I don't need it.

532
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
I'm not looking down on you.

533
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,420
But to be with Han Yi...

534
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,500
To be with her,

535
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,340
sincerity alone isn't enough.

536
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,340
You need to be smart too.

537
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,660
Otherwise...

538
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,540
Otherwise how will you handle
the people around her?

539
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,940
Especially her aunt,

540
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,900
Han Jialing.

541
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,220
If Ms. Ling finds out you're dating,

542
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,780
she'll eat you alive.

543
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
I don't care.

544
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,740
Let her try.

545
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,900
Don't you care if she

546
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,180
eats your girlfriend alive too?

547
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,660
When she turns on you,
she doesn't care about any ties.

548
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Anyway, no matter what,

549
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,220
I will

550
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,900
never

551
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,540
just leave

552
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,140
like someone did

553
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,380
without a word.

554
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,220
I'll never leave her alone.

555
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,180
Good.

556
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,780
Remember what you said today.

557
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,660
If you can't keep your word...

558
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,260
I'll make you pay.

559
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,100
Save it.

560
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,940
You won't get the chance.

561
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Come on.

562
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,740
Cheers.

563
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,100
Wake up.

564
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,900
Stop it.

565
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,260
I'm apologizing.

566
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,580
Seriously?

567
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,980
Go ahead.

568
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,460
Let her

569
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,060
join you.

570
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
What a good guy I am.

571
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,660
Told you you couldn't hold your liquor.

572
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,220
You had to challenge me.

573
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,980
I told you

574
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,540
you're no match for me.

575
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,900
Waiter!

576
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,220
Another round!

577
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,100
Hey, what are you doing?

578
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,900
Enough.

579
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,340
No more drinks.

580
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,340
Where do you live?

581
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,820
I...

582
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,820
I live at...

583
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,180
Where?

584
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,420
[181 3753 017]

585
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,860
Your phone's ringing.

586
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,900
Your phone's ringing.

587
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,700
I'll answer it then.

588
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,740
I really will.

589
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,940
Jinyuan,

590
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,540
I've dug up everything on Jia Fan.

591
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,060
All the information is in your email.

592
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,900
You were right.

593
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,700
It's because of his father.

594
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,140
By his sophomore year,

595
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,700
his dad's vision deteriorated badly,

596
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,940
to the point of being almost blind.

597
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,660
That's why he dropped out of school

598
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,740
and went to work at the seafood shop.

599
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,700
That's all for now.

600
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,740
I'll update you if I find more.

601
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,980
I'll hang up now.

602
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
[Men Whim]

603
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,060
[Whim]

604
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,300
He's awake.

605
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,220
You're awake.

606
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,820
What happened, young man?

607
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,020
Why are you lying here?

608
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,060
- Did you drink too much?
- You must have been drunk.

609
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,340
You reek of alcohol.

610
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,780
[Handsome guy sleepwalked here!
Risk of disturbance.]

611
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,700
You drank too much.

612
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,780
Easy does it.

613
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,860
- Take it easy.
- Slow down.

614
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,460
No, I'm good.

615
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,700
I'm okay.

616
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,980
Sorry.

617
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,500
I'll delete it now.

618
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,260
No worries.

619
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,140
Actually, could I borrow your phone?

620
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,580
Sure.

621
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,300
Mine's dead.

622
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,340
Thank you.

623
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,940
You're here.

624
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,820
Are you

625
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
going for a morning jog?

626
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,660
You can't wear those.

627
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,980
Let me get you some sneakers.

628
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,460
Didn't you need me for something?

629
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,260
What is it?

630
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,340
Shangpin and Lushen

631
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,020
somehow got wind of it

632
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,100
and called me early this morning,

633
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,380
saying they want to
increase the sponsorship.

634
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,860
They said they're flexible on terms

635
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,140
as long as Han Yijing is involved.

636
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,740
Based on this,

637
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,420
we might not have a choice.

638
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,620
It has to be those two.

639
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,580
Jia Fan.

640
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,780
Jia Fan again, huh?

641
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,300
Wait, what?

642
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,620
We were going to choose him.

643
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,220
Now it seems like

644
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,140
he's the one doing the choosing.

645
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,020
How is that fair?

646
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,380
Fine.

647
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,700
Tell them

648
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
to take it or leave it.

649
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,700
I'm not begging them!

650
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,260
What's going on?

651
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,340
Have someone check my car.

652
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,100
Stolen?

653
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,340
Should we call the police?

654
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,100
Don't bother.

655
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,260
Did you black out?

656
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,740
You must have drunk a lot.

657
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,980
Just leave me alone for a while.

658
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,060
You're up.

659
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,980
Perfect timing.

660
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,420
Wash up and come have some soup.

661
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,540
You scared me.

662
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,220
Are pigs flying?

663
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,020
You actually cooked.

664
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,260
You've been overworking lately.

665
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,740
Need proper nourishment.

666
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,380
Once this wraps up,
I'll give you some time off.

667
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,580
No need.

668
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,340
Don't push yourself.

669
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,300
Look at your face.

670
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,820
Slept poorly again?

671
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,220
My sleep is always terrible.

672
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,460
It doesn't matter what I do.

673
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,700
Heard you agreed to the cover shoot.

674
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,900
Yeah.

675
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,220
It's just work.

676
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,540
Even with Jia Fan?

677
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,100
Then we probably

678
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,940
can't take it.

679
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,860
Why?

680
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,980
You insisted that I do it

681
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,660
and go to that party.

682
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,620
You were clearly pulling strings.

683
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,420
Now you're like this
just because of Liao Jinyuan.

684
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,340
It's because of Jia Fan.

685
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,060
He refused.

686
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,940
Nothing I said worked.

687
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,460
Probably male pride.

688
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,340
What do you think?

689
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,220
I'll convince him.

690
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,580
I'm fine with it.

691
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,020
I respect his choice.

692
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,300
Aren't you trying to promote him?

693
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,940
How can you let him sabotage himself?

694
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,900
Besides,

695
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,420
a duo cover requires two people.

696
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,780
How can I do it without him?

697
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,940
He has to go.
