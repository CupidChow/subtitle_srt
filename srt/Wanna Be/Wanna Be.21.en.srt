But just before I could jump off...

11
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,460
a yellow sheet drifted past me.

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
It was filled with different wishes.

13
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,380

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,380

15

Ever since the car accident...

226
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,700
I haven't seen the spark in her eyes

227
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,940
for a long time.

228
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,780
Until she met Jia Fan.

229
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,100
She's still as brave as ever.

230
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Why are you here?

231
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,420
She never hesitates or holds back.

232
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
I'm here to pick up my girlfriend,

233
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,900
and I also have some news to share.

234
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,860
Go ahead.

235
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,980
I've been invited to take part
in Show Hall's live stream

236
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,580
next Tuesday at 1 PM

237
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,860
for a one-on-one interview.

238
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,060
Congratulations.

239
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,580
Congrats to you too,

240
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,740
for hitting over 10,000 in pre-sales.

241
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,020
You didn't buy it, did you?

242
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Of course, I did.

243
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,260
Everyone at the market has one.

244
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,940
My treat.

245
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
You're so nice to me.

246
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,620
Thank you, Mr. Jia, for your support.

247
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,420
You're most welcome.

248
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,700
Just take me out for a meal.

249
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,580
Sure,

250
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,660
but who's driving?

251
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,660
I'll drive.

252
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,980
Let's go.

253
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,140
I know...

254
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,100
she's really happy now.

255
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,740
Finally found someone
who understands her and loves her.

256
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,380
And someone who's willing
to give up everything for her.

257
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,260
But the happier she is now...

258
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,620
the more painful it will be.

259
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,980
So, I'd rather end it now.

260
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,980
I'd rather be the bad guy than…

261
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,940
It's her choice.

262
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,020
She has to endure
whatever pain comes with it.

263
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,980
Bit by bit, I raised her up...

264
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,820
all by myself.

265
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,540
She was six.

266
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,740
And I was only twenty.

267
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,140
I thought what was best for her
was the right thing.

268
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,940
That day, I hit her.

269
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,660
For the very first time.

270
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,100
The look she gave me...

271
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,300
was like she was looking at a stranger.

272
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,100
No.

273
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,900
Even worse than a stranger.

274
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,700
After half a lifetime of effort...

275
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,420
it turned out that I became

276
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,380
the person she hated most.

277
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,020
I want her to be happy too,

278
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,620
but why does it have to be Jia Fan?

279
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,780
Why can't it be Jia Fan?

280
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,500
Whoever it is,

281
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,820
the one she loves is the best.

282
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,020
There's really no "why."

283
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,300
Actually, you've done well enough.

284
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,580
Yijing knows that deep down.

285
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,140
Otherwise,
she wouldn't be suffering so much.

286
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,860
You're just the same.

287
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,860
You mean to care,

288
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,940
but it ends up sounding like a reproach.

289
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
You're family.

290
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,860
So it becomes harder

291
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,340
to tolerate over time.

292
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,780
She really was raised by me.

293
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,260
She picked up all my bad traits,

294
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,980
but none of the good.

295
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,700
Before our next chat,

296
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
you should have a drink,

297
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,020
let go of all your burdens,

298
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,420
and say whatever you want.

299
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,580
Like now?

300
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
Then,

301
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,820
I'll regret it
once the alcohol wears off.

302
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,020
How could I

303
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,700
say all this to you

304
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,340

Today, we have

a new guest with us.

355
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,740
He's both a fresh face in streaming

356
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,140
and a professional model,

357
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,100
Jia Fan.

358
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,180
Hi, everyone.

359
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm Jia Fan.

360
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,860
It's a pleasure to be here
as a guest on Show Hall today.

361
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
I can't really say

362
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,820
I'm a professional model yet,

363
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
but I'm working on it.

364
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,820
Not professional?

365
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,140
He's ruining my reputation.

366
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Why does his hair look like this?

367
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,460
I told him not to style it this way.

368
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,300
Be quiet!

369
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,220
I had an amazing group of friends

370
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,220
who helped me a lot

371
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,620
during the lowest point of my life,

372
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,180
showing me
that there's always a way forward.

373
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,100
Was he referring to us?

374
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,580
Probably.

375
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,420
Why didn't he make it clear?

376
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,340
Creating short videos...

377
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,380
No one's interested.

378
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,060
For me, it is about showcasing
the diversity of fashion.

379
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,300
It doesn't have to be confined
to the runway.

380
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,900
It can be found in everyday places
like the market,

381
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,420
where it's real

382
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,820
and tangible.

383
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,140
After stepping into this industry,

384
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,700
I realized that models

385
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,980
aren't just walking mannequins.

386
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,940
They are messengers.

387
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,620
They embody confidence

388
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,820
and the courage to try new things.

389
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,740
So,

390
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,260
as long as you are brave enough,

391
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,140
no matter where you are

392
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,820
or what your size and shape are,

393
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,340
you'll always shine.

394
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,860
Another motivation...

395
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,620
for these videos

396
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,980
is to get back into modeling.

397
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,460
This shouldn't be too hard, right?

398
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,740
It's still pretty hard for me.

399
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,780
After all,

400
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,340
I was fired from ACME.

401
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,740
Yeah, I've heard about that.

402
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,460
What was the reason?

403
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,380
Back then, I was young and arrogant,

404
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,860
thinking too highly of myself.

405
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,060
So today,

406
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,980
in front of everyone watching...

407
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,900
I want to sincerely apologize

408
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,900
to Ms. Ling from ACME.

409
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,740
These past experiences...

410
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,420
have shown me
the harsh reality of this industry,

411
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,300
but they've only made me
more determined.

412
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,260
Ms. Ling,

413
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,140
I want to return to ACME,

414
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,660
and I hope you'll give me
another chance.

415
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,460
To all the viewers,

416
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
please be my witnesses.

417
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,820
I will work hard to prove myself
and earn your recognition.

418
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,620
One day...

419
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,460
All right.

420
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
No problem, Wang.

421
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Please send me the documents first.

422
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,340
Okay.

423
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,380
Hey, Zhang.

424
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,620
Yes.

425
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,980
I'm handling the operations.

426
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,860
No problem at all.

427
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,060
He's like a real brother to me.

428
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,900
Consider it done.

429
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,140
All right.

430
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,980
Hello?

431
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,460
Yes, I am.

432
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,220
So, shall we meet next week?

433
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,300
Sounds good. See you then.

434
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,300
Fan!

435
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,620
We've gone viral!

436
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,820
In just an hour,

437
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,220
I've taken over ten calls.

438
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,980
They all want to work with us.

439
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,940
We've got time. No need to rush.

440
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,300
Do I look like someone
who only cares about money?

441
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm just happy

442
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,420
our hard work paid off.

443
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,780
Thanks to a stylist and agent like you.

444
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,940
Oh, come on.

445
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,500
Let's not talk about this on the street.

446
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,820
I'm here to welcome you back in triumph.

447
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,740
Please, after you.

448
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,940
You head back in triumph first.

449
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,860
I'll catch up.

450
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,260
What?

451
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,020
I'll pay for the taxi.

452
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,060
I'll treat you to a nice meal later.

453
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,900
See you.

454
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,180
Where are you going?

455
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,180
Are you getting in or not?

456
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,020
Come back!

457
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,300
I can't park here.

458
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,460
I'm getting in.

[With such determination,
Jia Fan is bound to succeed.]

463
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,940
[His courage to admit mistakes
is admirable.]

464
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,000
[He knows his stuff about modeling.]

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,900
[Letting Jia Fan return is a win-win.]

466
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,170
[He has a great bond
with his fellow ACME newcomers.]

467
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,180
[ACME, just let Jia Fan return.]

468

Interesting.

472
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,900
I'll discuss it with Ms. Ling first.

473
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,940
Understood.

474
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,740
Yeah.

475
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,580
I appreciate your help.

476
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,100
All right.

477
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,460
Come in.

478
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,060
Ms. Ling,

479
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,140
I need a quick decision
from you on something.

480
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,260
What are Whim's sales figures?

481
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,260
Do we have the numbers yet?

482
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,220
The final count isn't in yet,

483
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,420
but it's expected to exceed 100,000.

484
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,380
It will undoubtedly be
the best-selling issue of the year.

485
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Hold a meeting with them

486
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,220
and put together a report.

487
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,260
Let's promote it properly.

488
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,220
Those are all taken care of.

489
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,380
Ms. Ling.

490
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,300
I saw it.

491
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,020
Ignore him.

492
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,780
The hype won't last.

493
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,620
But the brands don't see it that way.

494
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,180
Quite a few of them
have already contacted us,

495
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,500
including a Spanish designer

496
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,740
named Panio.

497
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,500
Panio?

498
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,460
He's interested in Jia Fan?

499
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,220
Apparently, he's been following
Jia Fan for a while now.

500
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,820
If things work out,

501
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,460
he's even planning to fly over
for an in-person meeting.

502
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,100
Panio, who's always been
difficult to impress,

503
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,100
is actually interested in Jia Fan?

504
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,620
That's why I didn't turn him down.

505
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,940
I had someone keep him waiting.

506
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,900
Are you saying

507
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,500
that I should let him rejoin ACME?

508
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,180
Now is the perfect time
for him to return.

509
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,820
It aligns with public opinion

510
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,940
and facilitates collaboration.

511
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,860
Otherwise, Panio
will approach him anyway,

512
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,700
and we'll lose a great opportunity

513
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,300
while becoming a laughingstock
in the industry.

514
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,740
That would be a huge loss.

515
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,340
I'm done.

516
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,540
That was fast.

517
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,140
Are you leaving now, or…?

518
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,340
I can't leave yet.

519
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,300
A bunch of people
are waiting to take photos with me,

520
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,300
and I still have
some business discussions to handle.

521
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,780
That'll take at least an hour, right?

522
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,500
More or less.

523
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,660
What about you?

524
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,940
Are you home?

525
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,100

What's so important

529
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,660
that you have to handle it yourself?

530
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,140
Of course, it's something important.

531
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,380
It'll take about an hour.

532
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,060
There's still time.

533
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,060
After all, you're so popular now.

534
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,220

00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,420
I can't…

536
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,060

537
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,820

I was just trying to surprise you.

541
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,180
So, the most important thing
was to see me?

542
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,460
Who let that slip?

543
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,180
Shubo.

544
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,420
That traitor.

545
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,780
