00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,420
I've never been disappointed.

382
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,260
Nor will you this time.

383
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,740
I'm lucky, you know.

384
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,020
But the weather forecast predicted rain.

385
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,220
Why didn't you tell me?

386
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,860
I'll try my luck.

387
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,700
What if the sun comes out?

388
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
You're here anyway.

389
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,780
What if you're really lucky enough?

390
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,460
Okay.

391
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,980
If it really rains

392
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,300
and the sun doesn't come out,

393
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,300
I'll give you my light

394
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,300
and be your sun.

395
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,340
Before,

396
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,220
I always worked until the dawn.

397
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,460
I was too busy working

398
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,820
to look up

399
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,500
at the sky.

400
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,100
I remember it was in the hospital

401
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,940
that I watched the sunrise
for the first time.

402
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,620
Luckily, his internal organs
aren't injured.

403
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,140
He has a mild concussion

404
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,660
and a slight fracture
in his left shoulder.

405
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,820
No more problems.

406
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,820
In a dozen days,

407
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
he may get out of the hospital.

408
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,100
Because of his eyes again, right?

409
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,860
Yes.

410
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,100
He can barely see now.

411
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,620
Your father's vision
is narrowing sharply.

412
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,540
Soon he'll go blind.

413
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,980
Before he's fully used to blindness,

414
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,700
don't leave him alone.

415
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,980
He's old, after all.

416
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,300
If he's injured, there will be trouble.

417
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,500
At that time,

418
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,420
my father was in hospital.

419
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,780
I stayed there
and expected the sunrise for a week.

420
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,740
Sadly, it was raining the whole week.

421
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,540
I was really unlucky.

422
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,140
Before he could leave the hospital,

423
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,860
I wrote a bucket list.

424
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,580
I listed twenty or thirty things

425
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,940
as if I had done them.

426
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,020
Unfortunately,

427
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,980
I lost the list.

428
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,540
Bucket list?

429
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,460
I don't care, actually.

430
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,580
But if someone picked it up

431
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
and read it,

432
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,740
they'd think
I was just a sentimental mess.

433
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,900
Luckily enough,

434
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,260
I was young.

435
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,500
And I lost the list in the night.

436
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,180
I was listening to some sad music.

437
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,860
The atmosphere just saddened me.

438
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,700
Three years ago,

439
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,380
in Hengtai Hospital?

440
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,060
Yes.

441
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,540
Did I say Hengtai Hospital?

442
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,180
What's on your bucket list?

443
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,060
Do you still remember?

444
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,420
No.

445
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,140
Think hard.

446
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,460
I really can't remember.

447
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,260
How can someone

448
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,100
even forget his wishes?

449
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,820
My first wish...

450
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
To Watch the sunrise by the sea.

451
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,900
[1. To watch the sunrise by the sea.]

452
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,180
What about the second?

453
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,060
[2. To watch these movies for a day.]
To watch movies for a day.

454
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,380
[The Shawshank Redemption]
But I fell asleep after two movies.

455
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,300
And? Go on.

456
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,460
It's been a really long time.

457
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,420
I can't remember.

458
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,780
"To have a relationship."

459
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,980
"To get a pretty girlfriend."

460
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,900
"To take a road trip to Xizang."

461
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
"To have a barbecue

462
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,060
with my girlfriend,

463
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,180
an insanely spicy one."

464
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,300
"To take my father to try paragliding

465
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,180
and diving."

466
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,060
"To give him a ride around."

467
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,020
"To have an exciting dream."

468
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,300
A friend of mine

469
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,020
had a car accident three years ago.

470
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,540
Everybody told her

471
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,580
her future was over

472
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,580
and she could never recover.

473
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,940
She tried to kill herself, then.

474
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,220
But when she picked up
that yellow sheet,

475
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,660
she suddenly felt she was terrible.

476
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,420
Someone

477
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,140
struggled so hard to live

478
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,340
for such simple wishes.

479
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,220
How could she give up like that?

480
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,580
So,

481
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,900
she always wanted to see this guy

482
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,420
and tell him

483
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,900
"Thank you."

484
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,500
She lived because of him.

485
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,460
I should thank her.

486
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,020
Because of her, my first wish

487
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,020
has come true.
