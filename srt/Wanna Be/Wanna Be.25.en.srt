00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,420
What is it?

3
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,460
Where's Jia Fan?

4
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,660
Is he with you?

5
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,100
No way.

6
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,740
As the next ace of ACME,

7
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,020
he must be very busy

8
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,580
and has no time for me.

9
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,580
Looks like ACME really values him.

10
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,260
Let me ask you this.

11
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,820
With what you know about Ms. Ling,

12
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,740
would she

13
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,420
secretly get a doctor

14
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,980
for Jia Fan's dad?

15
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,260
No way.

16
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,100
She's not that nice.

17
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,500
She values Jia Fan

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,540
because he can bring her profit.

19
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,820
If it were you,

20
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,460
she'd be treating you the same.

21
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,980
She's not one

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,660
to do charity in silence.

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,980
She's nothing
but a money-making machine,

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,860
completely devoid

25
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,140
of human feeling.

26
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,660
You can't get through to her.

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,540
Did you guys

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,700
have a fight?

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,580
Fights make one objective,

30
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,860
right?

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,060
Couldn't agree more.

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,540
As for...

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,340
touching gestures like that?

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
So not her.

35
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,620
Unless it's for someone

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,340
who can bring her profit.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,100

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,100
Is this shot okay?

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,900
- So great.
- Very good.

Why are you back so early?

44
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,820
Thought you were shooting until tonight.

45
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,780
Well, since you're back,

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,060

47
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,180
It's been so long since you went.

Things have been so hectic lately.

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,060

Panio never goes to these things.

64
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,140
This time, he organized it himself.

65
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,020
What does that mean?

66
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,180
It means he's very impressed with you.

67
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,300
And he's flying to Spain early tomorrow.

68
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,260

86
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,740
Floral Lane...

87
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,180
I've never heard of it.

88
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,180
Then maybe I remembered it wrong.

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,740
Sorry to bother you.

90
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,020
It's okay.

91
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,340
I mistook you for someone else anyway.

92
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,500
I thought you were my son.

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,740

No.

It's okay.

How much longer can I hold out?

Can't you feel it?

108
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,420
I have painkillers.

109
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,300
Are you taking them

110
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,380
more and more often?

111
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,060
If you keep taking them like this,

112
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,580
your stomach will be ruined.

113
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,060
The patellar articular cartilage

114
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,500
and the ligaments around the knee joint

115
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,020
are all damaged to some extent.

116
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,260
Especially the quadriceps tendon

117
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,340
and the medial collateral ligament.

118
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,460
Early next month,

119
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,900
there's a very important show.

120
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,140
I have to be there.

121
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,020
What show isn't important to you?

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,140
It concerns ACME.

123
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,580
After this one,

124
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,340
I'll take a break.

125
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,620

126
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,500
Okay.

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,420
I'll see what I can do.

128
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,220
But you can't lie to me again.

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,060
Prescribe more painkillers.

130
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,540
They're a lifesaver.

131
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,780
Don't care about your boss, huh?

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,020
You even risk your life for her.

133
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,020
So far,

134
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,580
there are 15 brands interested.

135
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,740
And eight media partners.

136
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,780
Both are up 20% from last year,

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,540
including Liao Jinyuan's Whim.

138
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,780
You've confirmed
with all of them, right?

139
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,060
Offline is internal only.

140
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,180
It's mainly the livestream.

141
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,180
It's set.

142
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,260
The performance order is confirmed too.

Jia Fan opens.

145
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,060
The rest is pretty much the same.

146
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,300
We just need to decide
on the opener and closer.

147
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,500
How about this?

148
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,900
Han Yijing closes, and Xing Mo opens.

149
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,260
Xing Mo opens?

150
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
Jia Fan is still a rookie after all.

151
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,060
If Xing Mo could do it,
I would have arranged it already.

152
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,260
Why can't he do it?

153
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,180
Isn't he terminating his contract?

154
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,940
Said you signed off on it.

155
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,740
He's already sent it to legal.

156
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,460
It hasn't been stamped yet, has it?

157
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,740
As if it's that easy to walk away.

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,460
Put him on.

159
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,660
That's what I told him.

160
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,060
But he...

161
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,980
What did he say?

162
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,140
He refused.

163
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,900
That's a unilateral breach of contract.

164
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,940
He knows full well

165
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,020
how big this show means to us.

166
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,220
A big moment for ACME.

167
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,460
A performance showcase!

168
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,300
And yet, our top star isn't here.

169
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,580
How does that look?

170
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,780
It'll be a joke if word gets out.

171
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,340
That's true, but...

172
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,860
But the company has its rules.

173
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,500
Once the termination process begins,

174
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
no activities,

175
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,220
not even internal ones.

176
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,140
So yeah, his refusal makes sense.

177
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,420
But I don't get it.

178
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,820
Why was he so set

179
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,220
on terminating his contract

180
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,900
all of a sudden?

181
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,980
Normally,

182
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,940
he wouldn't be this impulsive.

183
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,140
When you were hospitalized last time,

184
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,380
he rushed over immediately.

185
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,340
He was worried sick.

186
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,500
What changed?

187
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,020
I got it.

188
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,980
Because of you.

189
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,300
You've been promoting Jia Fan lately.

190
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,220
As a veteran,

191
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,660
he must be feeling uncomfortable.

192
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,460
So this contract thing is just one way

193
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,900
to get your attention.

194
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,700
He's throwing a tantrum.

195
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,900
He's jealous.

196
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,140
No.

197
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,820
That's not what I meant.

198
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
I mean...

199
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,660
Enough!

200
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,540
Don't "mean" anything here.

201
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,980
If there's nothing else, you can leave.

202
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,820
Okay.

203
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,900
Call me if you need anything.

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,690
[Xing Mo]

205
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,980
What's the big deal?

206
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,040
[Closed]

207
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,050
[Open]

208
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,420
Why the sudden termination?

209
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,740
They never said a word about it before.

210
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,820
Are you asking me?

211
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,860
Why?

212
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,020
Have no idea.

213
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,140
We all have stuff

214
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,700
we don't talk about.

215
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,020
But that's no excuse to hurt people.

216
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,500
Who got hurt?

217
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,940
Ms. Ling?

218
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,900
Yes, Ms. Ling.

219
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,500
Ms. Ling is behind this.

220
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,860
Serves her right.

221
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,900
Jinyuan,

222
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,220
I came early in the morning

223
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,380
just to serve you.

224
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,420
Don't be so mean please.

225
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,740
Besides,

226
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,300
Ms. Ling is my former boss.

227
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,180
She's been kind to me.

228
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,380
Save that talk for Mo.

229
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,140
Did he

230
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,180
fight with Ms. Ling again?

231
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,340
You always stop halfway,

232
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,860
every time.

233
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,020
And then,

234
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,580
we both end up suffering.

235
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,740
Suffering?

236
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,100
Yeah.

237
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,140
If I'm suffering,

238
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,300
I'm dragging him with me.

239
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,700
Mo.

240
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,620
Where's Mo?

241
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,020
He's not here.

242
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,980
His phone's been off.

243
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,980
He won't be here until tonight.

244
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,820
Why are you here too?

245
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,940
Good timing.

246
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Saves me the trouble to find you.

247
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,540
What do you want?

248
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,540
No alcohol during the day.

249
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,260
And I can't outdrink you anyway.

250
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,740
Let's play basketball.

251
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,220
Just the two of us.

252
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,620
One-on-one.

253
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,460
Jia Fan.

254
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,380
He's drunk and in a bad mood.

255
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,780
Don't mind...

256
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,780
This isn't your business.

257
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,300
You up for it?

258
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,620
Come on.

259
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,300
Wait, if you want to fight,

260
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,980
just say it.

261
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,740
Yeah!

262
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,500
I just want to

263
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,820
punch you to death, you scumbag.

264
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,500
I was so foolish.

265
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,220
I trusted you, again and again.

266
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,460
You knew it?

267
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,860
If I'd known earlier,

268
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,340
I wouldn't have dragged her in.

269
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,580
Come on.

270
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,780
Tell me.

271
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,220
Why keep it from us all this time?

272
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,060
Why?

273
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,620
She's been through so much.

274
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,980
She finally moved on.

275
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,140
And now?

276
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,820
She met someone like you.

277
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,180
I thought you were a stand-up guy.

278
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,740
Turns out you're just a liar!

279
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,820
Look at you.

280
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,660
What can you offer her?

281
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,620
You'll only hurt her

282
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,540
and ruin her life.

283
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,820
I swear...

284
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,660
Liao Jinyuan!

285
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,500
What are you doing?

286
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,420
Enough!

287
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,300
Stay out of this.

288
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,300
Mo.

289
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,780
This is between us.

290
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,820
Don't forget

291
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,580
you've got a show early next month.

292
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,380
You're a partner in this.

293
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,860
What?

294
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,500
Are you two going to

295
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,260
show up with bruises together?

296
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,220
Even now, you still care about it?

297
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,060
Ms. Ling trained you well.

298
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,700
Mo,

299
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,580
he's coming after me.

300
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,740
It has nothing to do with you.

301
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,780
Go back now.

302
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
Don't drink if you can't handle it.

303
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
Mind your own business.

304
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,540
If you have time,

305
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,100
keep your junior in check.

306
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,620
Are you okay?

307
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,060
Hello?

308
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,860
Mr. Liao,

309
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,780
ACME sent the cooperation agreement.

310
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,740
There are some details
we need you to check.

311
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Should I send it to your email or...?

312
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,140
Set up a meeting with Han Jialing.

313
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,460
I want to talk to her in person.

314
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
Tomorrow or the day after is fine.

315
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,940
To be honest,

316
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,180
Liao Jinyuan isn't a bad guy.

317
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,980
He just can't hold his liquor.

318
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,860
One drink turns into ten.

319
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,180
Then he loses it.

320
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,620
No one can hold him back.

321
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,020
He wasn't drunk today.

322
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,500
Stone-cold sober.

323
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,220
It's been rough for him all these years.

324
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,540
He's been living with regret.

325
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,060
Terrible insomnia every day.

326
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,700
I always thought

327
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,740
Yijing would be the one still stuck.

328
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,460
But surprisingly it was Liao Jinyuan.

329
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm not defending him.

330
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,740
I just don't want you

331
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,700
to let it get to you.

332
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,060
I won't.

333
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,700
It's not his fault.

334
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,340
So it's your own fault then?

335
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,860
Mo.

336
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,260
Actually, I came today...

337
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,860
I won't ask why it was your fault.

338
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,420
So don't ask me about termination.

339
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,580
Can you stay?

340
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,740
No.

341
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,060
Why not?

342
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,220
Don't get me wrong.

343
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,340
I'm not asking you about termination.

344
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,740
I'm asking why you can't stay.

345
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,660
What's the difference?

346
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,940
Do you think I'm stupid?

347
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,060
You brat.

348
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,660
But you're my idol.

349
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,940
If you leave, who will be my goal?

350
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,340
Then become someone else's idol.

351
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,860
Don't let them catch up.

352
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,100
That's your goal.

353
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
So it is because of me.

354
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,060
What are you talking about?

355
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,460
You're so full of yourself.

356
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,180
Alright.

357
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,620
Don't try to comfort me. I get it.

358
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
You get nothing.

359
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,860
You won't catch up in five years.

360
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,140
I debuted at my peak.

361
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,420
It's been ten years.

362
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,660
I've walked every runway, big and small.

363
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,700
Seen it all, earned it all.

364
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,740
All of it.

365
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,900
Next,

366
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,740
it's time to enjoy life.

367
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,820
Don't try to talk me out of it.

368
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,980
Unless my happy life bothers you.

369
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,860
You still care, don't you?

370
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,620
You've built this for years.

371
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,700
It's not that easy to just let go.

372
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,340
If you were me,

373
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,700
you'd do the same thing.

374
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,820
Guess I'm retiring early, huh?

375
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,340
Bar at night,

376
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,540
basketball in the morning.

377
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,140
Sun on my face, wind in my hair.

378
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,780
It's great, isn't it?

379
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,100
You.

380
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,580
Make the most of your youth.

381
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,740
Hold on to what's yours.

382
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,020
No matter what others say,

383
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,740
what's yours is yours.

384
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,220
As long as you take responsibility,

385
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,780
and don't give in.

386
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,380
Where the heck are you?

387
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,340
You're not answering calls or texts.

388
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,100
Call me back as soon as you see this.

389
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,980
Did you really propose the termination?

390
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,580
What's going on?

391
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,380
If you don't call me back,

392
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,860
I swear I'll camp out at your bar.

393
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,420
You're still in the mood for coffee?

394
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,460
I need to stay awake.

395
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,860
It has nothing to do with my mood.

396
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,140
Xing Mo's terminating his contract.

397
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,500
He...

398
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
He's not a kid.

399
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,420
He must have a reason for doing this.

400
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,260
What reason?

401
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,500
Is it really because of me?

402
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,780
He has a crush on me and I found out.

403
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,060
Like I'd ever agree to that.

404
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,980
Besides, I like his best buddy.

405
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,780
We're at the office all day,

406
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,500
always running into each other.

407
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,020
He...

408
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
has a crush on you?

409
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,380
He told you that?

410
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,740
I guessed it.

411
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,580
He told you?

412
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,060
Don't worry.

413
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,460
Even if he had a crush,

414
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
it'd be on Han Jialing, not you.

415
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,780
Han Yijing!

416
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,860
Then it must be because of Jia Fan.

417
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,900
As soon as Jia Fan came back,

418
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,340
he took all of Mo's resources.

419
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,820
Xing Mo had no choice, so he...

420
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,660
Those resources

421
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
were originally meant for Jia Fan.

422
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,660
Without Jia Fan,

423
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,860
Xing Mo wouldn't have had a chance.

424
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,500
Plus, don't underestimate Xing Mo.

425
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,860
Someone like Jia Fan

426
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,420
couldn't bring him down.

427
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,580
Remember this.

428
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,660
First,

429
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,220
Jia Fan deserves everything he has.

430
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,140
He wouldn't

431
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,780
and couldn't steal anyone's resources.

432
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,540
Second,

433
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,780
Xing Mo isn't you.

434
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,620
He doesn't blame others

435
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,980
for what he can't get.

436
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,660
Watch your mouth next time,

437
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,420
or you'll face another Huang Jinde.

438
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Just kidding.

439
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,780
You're really defending him, huh?

440
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,300
Where were you?

441
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,580
I was looking for Mo.

442
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,620
Don't you know when the rehearsal is?

443
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Late on the first day.

444
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,020
It's okay.

445
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,140
I was just playing basketball.

446
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,140
Basketball at a time like this?

447
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,380
My bad.

448
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,180
What's up with you guys?

449
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,100
A ten-minute break

450
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,260
and you ran off to buy drinks?

451
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,700
Got energy to burn, huh?

452
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,020
This is your first time participating

453
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,260
in the ACME public show.

454
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,260
Your first real debut.

455
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,780
All the brands, media, and peers

456
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
are watching you.

457
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,700
You don't just represent Top Line,

458
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,780
but yourselves.

459
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,900
So you have to be at your best.

460
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,820
Buck up!

461
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,300
Make those who lost to you

462
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,140
accept their defeat.

463
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,140
Got it?

464
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,300
- Got it.
- Got it.

465
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,940
Then hurry up and go.

466
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
Sorry, Ms. Han.

467
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,020
It won't happen again.

468
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,580
What are you thinking about?

469
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,420
Nothing.

470
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Do you notice anything weird lately?

471
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,580
It's quite off.

472
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,300
Huang Jinde
went quiet after his threats.

473
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,420
Jia Fan finally came back,

474
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,700
but you two barely date.

475
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,980
Do your own stuff even at the same show.

476
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,660
And Xing Mo

477
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,540
suddenly terminated his contract.

478
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Ms. Ling hasn't reacted at all.

479
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,340
Like nothing happened.

480
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,780
Just business as usual.

481
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,060
It's like the calm before the storm.

482
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,820
An eerie calm.

483
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,420
What are you eating?

484
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,460
Nothing.

485
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,100
What do you mean by "nothing"?

486
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,380
You're acting strange too.

487
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,900
Vitamins.

488
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,700
Anyway, be prepared for something big.

489
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,180
My sixth sense is never wrong.

490
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,620
Something big is about to go down.

491
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,940
She's been through so much.

492
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,300
She finally moved on.

493
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,460
And now?

494
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,260
Now she runs into you.

495
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,180
What can you offer her?

496
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,100
You can't give her anything.

497
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,260
You'll only hurt her

498
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,940
and ruin her life.

499
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,780
Make the most of your youth.

500
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,300
Hold on to what's yours.

501
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,700
No matter what others say,

502
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,340
what's yours is yours.

503
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,780
As long as you take responsibility,

504
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,580
and don't give in.

505
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,620
The only thing you should do for me

506
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,380
is keep working.

507
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,860
Work hard as you do now

508
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,900
and go to a bigger stage.

509
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,500
No matter what happens,

510
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,060
I hope you won't forget your resolution

511
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,140
or what you said to me.

512
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,660
No one can ask you to give up

513
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,460
and no one can deprive you
of having a dream.

514
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,940
Whatever you suffer,

515
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,460
I will love you

516
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,220
and be with you.

517
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
When I'm around,

518
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,780
you'll never be scared.

519
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,580
Fan, Uncle Jia!

520
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,380
Get out! Fire!

521
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,060
Get out!

522
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,700
Where's the fire?

523
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,420
Where?

524
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,260
What's going on?

525
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,100
Uncle Jia!

526
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,260
Just kidding!

527
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,780
You can't joke about this!

528
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,140
You...

529
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,460
Come on, let's go.

530
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,180
Look at you.

531
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,220
This is Fan's poster.

532
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,460
You took it back?

533
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,340
A little further.

534
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,100
You did take it back.

535
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,620
He's so handsome, isn't he?

536
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,540
Takes after me, doesn't he?

537
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,060
Of course.

538
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,740
Well, look who his father is.

539
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,500
How is it?

540
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,500
I nailed it, didn't I?

541
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,340
Well done.

542
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,340
No wonder she's your idol.

543
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,860
You know that?

544
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,380
Only she has this photo.

545
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,220
It was her idea,

546
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,420
but I'm the one who pulled it off.

547
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,460
We all want Uncle Jia to see you

548
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,340
and be proud of you.

549
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,900
Thanks.

550
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,900
You're welcome.

551
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,860
This is what fan support looks like.

552
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,860
Alright, Dad.

553
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,260
You'll get your snot all over my face.

554
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,820
I got carried away.

555
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,940
That's too much.

556
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,940
Never seen a hot guy before?

557
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,100
Then it's settled.

558
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,860
If any issues come up,

559
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,700
we can discuss them later.

560
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,740
Okay.

561
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,460
I've sent the revised agreement

562
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,220
to the legal.

563
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,940
By tomorrow at the latest.

564
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,420
Okay.

565
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,260
After you stamp it, just mail it to me.

566
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,180
Saves us a trip.

567
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,540
Now that the business is settled,

568
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,020
let's turn to personal matters,
Ms. Ling.

569
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,060
I'll wait for you in the car.

570
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,260
No need.

571
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,700
You can head back to the office.

572
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,820
Okay.

573
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,660
Shoot.

574
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,580
Is this about your history with Yijing,

575
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,580
or about Jia Fan's eyes?

576
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,580
Wu Ming already told me.

577
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,340
But he doesn't know anything.

578
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,140
He always thought
it was Jia Fan's father.

579
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,380
When did you find out?

580
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,060
Before he joined ACME.

581
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,660
It was originally a good gimmick.

582
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,100
He could go blind at any time.

583
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,820
How unique.

584
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,540
But I didn't think they'd get together.

585
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,300
Even so,

586
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,420
you still brought him back.

587
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,380
Because he has commercial value.

588
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,740
He can make you money.

589
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,460
I didn't get it.

590
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,540
Han Yijing is your family after all.

591
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,780
How could you be so cruel to her?

592
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,260
She already knows.

593
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,460
I didn't admit it though.

594
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,380
But she's not stupid.

595
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,420
She's with him every day.

596
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,980
She must sense something.

597
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,500
No way she'll break up with him.

598
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,660
So I can only find a way

599
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,540
to have his eyes cured.

600
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,420
What if they can't be cured?

601
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,500
Then...

602
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,660
It's their own business.

603
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,420
Ms. Ling, please stop joking.

604
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,580
How can you let her

605
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,660
be with someone like that?

606
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,940
Tell me the truth.

607
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,340
Why?

608
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,420
Why did you force me

609
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,500
to break up with her back then?

610
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,100
But you're fine with her

611
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,660
dating someone

612
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,300
who might go blind at any time?

613
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,020
Because I don't want to see her die.

614
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,660
When you left back then,

615
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,420
she had a car accident.

616
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,540
We barely saved her.

617
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,980
We thought everything would get better.

618
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,300
But I didn't expect

619
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,500
her suffering had just begun.

620
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,580
She wouldn't eat or drink.

621
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
Not a tear, not a sound.

622
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,420
Just kept her eyes open all day.

623
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,780
No reaction to anything.

624
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,980
Like the living dead.

625
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,620
You can't leave now.

626
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,500
Your leg hasn't healed.

627
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,420
You can't leave!

628
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,660
Then she started acting out.

629
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,580
She kept screaming to go home.

630
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,340
I knew she wanted to find you.

631
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,300
To make her give up,

632
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,380
I played her that recording.

633
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,220
And then...

634
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,090
[Triazolam Tablets]

635
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,060
Since then

636
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,020
I started following her.

637
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,900
That was the only thing

638
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,980
I could do.

639
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,420
Even now,

640
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,020
I don't know what she saw.

641
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,660
And I'm afraid to ask.

642
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,860
Anyway, since that day she came down
from the rooftop,

643
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,020
she changed.

644
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,660
She started listening to doctors,

645
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,460
and cooperating with her treatment.

646
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,020
That's when she truly came alive again.

647
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,300
Liao Jinyuan.

648
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
There's something

649
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,820
I've always wanted

650
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,780
to tell you.

651
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,900
I'm sorry.

652
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,300
Yijing's career was taking off.

653
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,860
I just wanted her to succeed.

654
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,820
I pushed too hard,

655
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,500
and never cared how she felt.

656
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,500
Until she was lying in the hospital,

657
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,540
that's when

658
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,140
I regretted it.

659
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,220
But it was too late to do anything.

660
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,820
I could only keep going.

661
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,620
Ms. Ling.

662
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,860
She's already died once.

663
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,620
It can't happen again.

664
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm begging you

665
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,500
to just be a bystander.

666
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
Even though

667
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,420
I've resisted until now,

668
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,540
I know deep down

669
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,980
I can't fight them.

670
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,780
I give up.

671
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,700
Besides,

672
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,100
the more I oppose,

673
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,260
the less effective it is.

674
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,380
I've learned that lesson.

675
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,260
Maybe if I let go completely,

676
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,140
they'll break up on their own.

677
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,700
So let it be.

678
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,700
Let them...

679
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,700
walk their own path.

680
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,980
Wait a minute.

681
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,300
Let's add a clause to the agreement.

682
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,100
Xing Mo

683
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,740
has to be in this show.

684
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,500
Otherwise it's a breach of contract.
