00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,980
That was awesome!

3
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,140
You've really made us proud!

4
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,660
It was nothing, really.

5
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,940
You're all so happy, huh?

6
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,620
Well, I guess you should be.

7
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,700
Landing such a golden opportunity
in just two months

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,580
is indeed worth celebrating.

9
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,300
All right.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,660
That's enough.

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,900
Why?

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,660
It doesn't matter if it's not me,

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,460
but why him?

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,900
Why can't it be me?

Do you even know your own limits?

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,940
Just a few months ago,
you didn't even know what modeling was,

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,820
and now you've landed a deal
with an international brand.

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,740
No real ability,

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,260

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,500
I have to say, I'm impressed.

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,940
What scheming?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,980
It was the brand's choice,

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,580
not Ms. Ling's.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
Did you all get that?

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,860

26

00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,780

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,740

because of your connections!

Don't stir up trouble.

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,380
We never said that.

34

If you have a problem, just say it.

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,140
Don't throw accusations at me.

36

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,060
I do have a problem with this.

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,900

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,060
all just to get attention.

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,620
Clever move.

47
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,180
What did you just say?

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,500
I dare you to say it again.

49
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,660
Stop acting innocent.

50

The comments say it all.

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,420
You used your own dad

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
as a selling point
just to land a brand deal.

Shut up!

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,540
You're the one who can't handle losing,
yet you're dragging me into it?

67

Don't you know how things work?

69
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,700
The brand has its own standards,

70
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,620
so their choice is fair,
no matter who they pick.

71
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,700
If you've got a problem,

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,980
go take it up with them.

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,420

won't change anything.

is as unbreakable

were secretly unconvinced

132
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,820
but just didn't dare to say it out loud.

133

Now, thanks to Ding Chen,
they've vented their frustrations,

134

and Xing Mo was forced to take a stand.

135
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,420
This has actually made things easier.

136
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,820
At the very least, this opportunity

137
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,900
is still yours.

138
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,780

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,340
but you were the one who got it.

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,780
So getting a little criticism
is no big deal.

142
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,100
Is this the mindset

143
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,860
that got you through all these years?

144

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,740

if you ever need any advice.

150
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,300
Then cheer up

151
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,420
and stop feeling sorry for Xing Mo.

152
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,060
The more guilt you show,

153
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,540
the more defeated he'll feel.

154
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,900
Just focus on what you need to do.

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,340
Calm down.

163
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,860
Besides, a little champagne
won't get you drunk.

164
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,260
Don't.

165
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,100
Careful.

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
Don't splash it on me!

167
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,700
Feel sorry now?

168
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,740
Yes.

169
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,860

Once you become the brand ambassador,

175
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,060

180
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,380

a gift like this

185
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,820
shouldn't be defined
solely by its price tag.

186
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,180
It's also about...

187
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,500
What I want is for you

188
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,940
to never keep your distance

189
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,620
from me, no matter what.

190
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,580
Even if it means
dealing with Huang Jinde.

191
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,020
I know all about

192
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,460
what happened that day.

193
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,740
If it were the old days,

194
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,420
I'd have blocked you long ago.

195
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,780
I'm Han Yijing, after all.

196
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,860
Which man wouldn't want
to be associated with me?

197
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
A bit of scandal here and there,
a quick clarification,

198
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,980
and suddenly opportunities
and work come their way.

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,540
So over the years, I've only had

200
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,180
colleagues by my side,

201
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,140
but no true friends.

202
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,500
But lately,

203
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,300
I've been thinking

204
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,740
that having someone

205
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,980
to grab a drink with,

206
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,660
take a late-night stroll,

207
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,820
and share a midnight snack

208
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
is actually pretty great.

209
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,860
They are way more fun
than those celebration parties.

210
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,780
I want to be the person I truly like,

211
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,300
not just the Han Yijing
everyone else sees.

212
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,100
This gift is for you.

213
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,260
From now on,

214
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,060
as long as you don't block me,

215
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,660
I'll always be there for you.

216
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,860
After all, you're Han Yijing,

217
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,020
which man wouldn't want
to be associated with you?

218
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,580
Stir up a little scandal,

219
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,420
and I'll skyrocket to success.

220
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,340
You wish.

221
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,060
I didn't tell you

222
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,100
because I was worried
you'd keep your distance,

223
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,060
block me,

224
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,460
or simply avoid me

225
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,180
to dodge

226
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,780
any misunderstanding.

What's wrong?

240
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,860
A person went by,

241
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,020
acting all furtive.

242
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,780
It was probably
just a clueless newcomer.

243
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,820
These newbies
are indeed pretty unreliable.

244
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,830
Being alone

245
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,980
with a senior female colleague
at this hour,

246
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,580
aren't you worried about the gossip?

247
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,820
We're simply having
an intellectual discussion.

248
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,860
As long as you don't spread rumors,

249
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,100
no one will be gossiping.

250
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,020
No.

251
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,820
What Ms. Han meant to say was that...

252
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,460
Please don't misunderstand.

253
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,020
If there is something between us,
we'll be somewhere else.

254
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,420
We won't be here, will we?

255
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,380
You even had a drink together.

256
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,500
How romantic

257
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,300
of you.

258
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,300
You Ning, I...

259
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,380
I get it now.

260
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,980
You two aren't having
an intellectual discussion at all.

261
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,220
You were just secretly celebrating

262
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,660
behind our backs.

263
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,540
Honestly,

264
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,980
have you no heart?

265
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,580
After all,

266
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,340
Xing Mo's been working
with you for years

267
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,460
and he's treated you well.

268
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,700
It's fine if you feel no guilt,

269
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,100
but how can you be drinking here?

270
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,340
Why should we feel guilty?

271
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,380
He didn't cheat or steal anything.

272
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,420
He won it by his own efforts.

273
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,820
Just like how you won against me?

274
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,300
Ladies.

275
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,260
Look,

276
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,540
it's getting late.

277
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,740
How about having
a late-night snack together?

278
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
- No appetite.
- I'll pass.

279
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's all go home then.

280
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,740
Staying up late is bad for our skin,

281
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,380
right?

282
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,980
You go ahead.

283
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,580
I'll take her home.

284
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,980
Besides, you've had a drink,

285
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,380
so you can't drive anyway.

286
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,300
We'll have a private chat

287
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,700
on the way.

288
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,700
I'll wait for you downstairs.

289
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,340
It's not like she'll do anything to me.

290
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,340
I'll be fine.

291
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,700
What do you want to chat about?

292
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,660
Go ahead.

293
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,980
So, you and Jia Fan
are really a thing now?

294
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,980
See.

295
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,740
How could I not be suspicious
when you react like that?

296
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,860
We shared the same bed for years.

297
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
If anyone knows you best,

298
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,860
it's me.

299
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,900
Back then,

300
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,420
we had nothing,

301
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,380
but at least we had each other.

302
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,940
We ate, lived, and slept side by side.

303
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,140
We trained together

304
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,060
during the day,

305
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,220
and at night,

306
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,380
we'd secretly order takeout.

307
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,220
When Ms. Ling caught us,

308
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,660
we covered for each other.

309
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,540
If one of us had feelings for someone,

310
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,780
we'd tell each other right away.

311
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,300
You never

312
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,500
beat around the bush.

313
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,100
You always spoke your mind.

314
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,220
So, do you still love Jinyuan?

315
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,980
The Han Yijing I knew

316
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,420
would have faced everything head-on,

317
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,780
never hiding or holding back.

318
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,860
So this is what reminiscing the past
feels like.

319
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,700
Well then, I'll tell you this.

320
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,020
I don't care who you love.
It has nothing to do with me.

321
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,220
Don't go back on your words.

322
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,780
Promise me

323
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,300
that if he ever comes back,

324
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,420
you won't contact him

325
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,140
or try to get close to him.

326
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,420
Even if you run into him,

327
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,020
you won't be the one to speak first.

328
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,940
You Ning,

329
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,340
you don't still seriously believe

330
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,740
that I was the one who came
between you two, do you?

331
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,740
What other explanation is there?

332
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,060
If it hadn't been for you...

333
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,300
He still wouldn't be into you.

334
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
Han Yijing,

335
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,180
whether he's into me or not

336
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,380
is my business.

337
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,940
As for you,

338
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,220
just focus on your Jia Fan.

339
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,260
If you ask me,

340
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,860
he's a much better match for you

341
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,900
than Liao Jinyuan.

342
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,220
He's young, handsome,

343
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,060
smart,

344
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,420
and in the same field as you.

345
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,860
You'll have the perfect combo
of love and career.

346
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,140
Pull over.

347
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,780
Why?

348
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,020
I'll just take a cab back.

349
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,500
Come on, just let me take you home.

350
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,820
If you don't pull over now,
I'm getting out myself.

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,380
Look at who's here.

559
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,180
These are people
I never thought I'd meet.

560
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,420
Oh, my gosh.

561
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,180
I...

562
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,020
I never imagined I'd be sitting

563
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,220
at the same table,
sharing a meal with you all.

564
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,140
I feel like I should be holding a banner

565
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,700
and giving you a grand welcome.

566
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
A big welcome to you all.

567
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,220
All right, that's enough.

568
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,540
That's a bit much.

569
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,660
If you keep this up,

570
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,820
we won't dare to come back.

571
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,180
I won't do it.

572
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,340
Come by anytime. You're always welcome.

573
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,140
Actually, we should have come earlier,
right?

574
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,860
After all, Jia Fan is now our colleague

575
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,980
and also my student.

576
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,940
We should have come sooner.

577
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,060
As a parent, I have to say something.

578
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,460
I really should have done better today.

579
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,980
Honestly,

580
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,380
without all of you as his mentors,

581
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,060
my son wouldn't be where he is today.

582
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,940
I sincerely hope that, in the future,

583
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,420
you will continue to guide him

584
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,100
with patience.

585
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,300
No need to be so formal, Mr. Jia.

586
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,300
Mr. Jia,

587
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,420
no need for such formality.

588
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,500
Just treat us like any other customers.

589
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,780
Oh, that won't do.

590
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,380
Who is she?

591
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,740
My future leader.

592
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,380
Actually, it's all thanks to Ms. Han.

593
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,300
If she hadn't insisted on coming,

594
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,660
we wouldn't...

595
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,580
Let's dig in.

596
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,500
Or I'll have low blood sugar again.

597
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,580
Ah, yes.

598
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,660
Exactly, let's eat.

599
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,660
The food's getting cold. Did in.

600
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,060
Let's eat while we chat.

601
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,700
Come on, Miss.

602
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,540
Try this abalone first.

603
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,620
It may look small, but it's wild-caught.

604
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,900
Simin,

605
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,260
our oysters are super fresh.

606
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,140
That's right.

607
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,100
Help yourself.

608
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,900
That's more than enough, Mr. Jia.

609
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,020
I grew this in my backyard.

610
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,860
Is this organic?

611
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,700
Of course.

612
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,140
It's completely free of fertilizer.

613
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
The seeds alone set them apart
from regular tomatoes,

614
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,740
Mr. Jia.

615
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,940
Simin, have one of these too.

616
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,820
Yes, have some of those.

617
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,580
Come on.

618
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,300
Ms. Dong.

619
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,460
Since everyone seems
to be enjoying the food,

620
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,900
maybe I should get two more lobsters.

621
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,620
That won't do.

622
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,500
Our guests are important.

623
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,460
Two lobsters aren't enough.

624
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,380
Make it six.

625
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,740
Sure.

626
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,420
Money's not an issue.

627
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
You had me worried for a moment.

628
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Eat as much as you want.

629
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,060
You get startled so easily.

630
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,260
Ms. Dong loves to mess with you.

631
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,620
Very generous of you, Ms. Dong.

632
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,300
Come on, let's eat.

633
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,860
Help yourself.

634
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,140
Dig in.

635
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,820
Simin, don't be shy.

636
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,300
Eat to your heart's content.

637
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,900
Don't just sit there.

638
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,180
Make yourself at home.

639
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,300
Drop by whenever you want.

640
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,420
Make yourself at home.

641
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,460
No need to be shy.

642
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,260
Thank you.

643
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,100
Thanks, Ms. Dong.

644
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,060
Come say hi.

645
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,700
I'll go over for a bit.

646
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,620
Then we'll...

647
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,500
Let's treat each other like family.

648
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,980
Careful.

649
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,540
Don't get pinched by it again.

650
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,380
How long do you plan on staying here?

651
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,540
It's only going to get busier.

652
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
Can you manage?

653
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,380
I've got it covered.

654
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Are you working so hard

655
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,820
because of your dad's eyes?

656
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,220
I didn't know you were so filial.

657
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
