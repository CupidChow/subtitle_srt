00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,980
[Wanna Be]

2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,780
Have you heard?

3
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,220
The designer is fastidious.

4
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,180
He curses all the time.

5
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,740
He seems to have a bad temper.

6
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,020
Lu.

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,020
Did you hear?

8
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,740
If he annoys you,

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,420
hold your temper.

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,860
Don't hit him.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,580
Yeah.

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,460
You can do martial arts

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,780
and you'll hurt him really hard.

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,980
Then, we'll have to lose you.

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,900
If only Fan were here.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,860
He would get the job.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,740
If he were here, we'd stand no chance.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,820
We could just go back.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,020
What is your problem?

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,780
The other day,
you hugged him sentimentally.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,900
Now, you turn against him.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,300
This isn't about how I feel.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,460
This is a fact.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,540
Right?

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,380
You can go back now.

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:18,740
Why?

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,380
Fan.

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,020
Fan.

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,700
You're all here.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,100
How was the review?

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,260
Did it go smoothly?

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,980
Yes.

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,860
We passed it.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,780
We're picking up jobs now.

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,740
We're much busier now.

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,620
That's good.

37
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,100
What about you?

38
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,900
Is everything okay?

39
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,700
I heard you had some auditions.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,260
But I didn't get a job.

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,060
So, here I am.

42
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,860
I don't care if I get a job.

43
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,140
I'll take it as a learning experience.

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,220
Right.

45
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,500
No.26 to No.30, come with me.

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,740
Come on.

47
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,340
I should go.

48
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,100
Okay, Fan.

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,820
- Come on.
- Come on!

50
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,340
Bye-bye.

51
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,300
Fighting.

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,740
Yao Yao.

53
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,620
It's you, huh?

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,420
Did you edit your photos too much

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,180
or did your cosmetic surgery fail?

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,380
You look different from your photos.

57
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,060
How dare you come here?

58
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,060
This is just fraud.

59
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,700
Yes, you.

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,380
Turn around.

61
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,540
A model? Seriously?

62
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,100
He's okay.

63
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
Put him on the maybe list.

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,580
What are you doing?

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,660
No... Nothing.

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,180
You must have lied about your waist.

67
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,060
I didn't.

68
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,820
Fine.

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,060
Take off your coat and put this on.

70
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,940
Right here?

71
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,620
Or where else?

72
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,940
In your home?

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,140
But sir,

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,780
I see a fitting room over there.

75
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,580
Can I...?

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,100
Do what you're told!

77
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,220
Stop gibbering!

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,260
I told you

79
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,380
not to use new models!

80
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,340
They aren't professional at all!

81
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,260
You want a fitting room, huh?

82
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,340
What are you doing here? Shopping?

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,380
Do it or get out!

84
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,220
Seriously?

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,780
Sir,

86
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,180
it doesn't mean she isn't professional.

87
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,980
This isn't a show, after all.

88
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,260
And who are you?

89
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,980
Jia Fan.

90
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,980
Jia Fan?

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,700
Remove him from the list.

92
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,500
Love to act the hero, huh?

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,500
Okay.

94
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,660
Let me teach you some kind of lesson.

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,060
What is a model?

96
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,460
A model is a rack!

97
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,500
Dress and undress

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,780
as directed.

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Do this job

100
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,180
or get out of here!

101
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,980
What's so funny?

102
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,620
According to Mr. Jimmy,

103
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,060
models aren't humans

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,820
but props for designers.

105
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,820
They have no pride

106
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,940
or shame.

107
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,860
In any situation or in front of anyone,

108
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,100
they can undress themselves.

109
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,340
What on earth are you doing?

110
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,220
I'll post it online.

111
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,740
I can't keep

112
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,900
these wise words to myself.

113
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,820
I'll share them with more guys.

114
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,100
Especially other models, right?

115
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,540
You all witnessed it, huh?

116
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,780
Get out.

117
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,740
I said, get out!

118
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,500
You stay here.

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,180
What's wrong?

120
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,100
What happened?

121
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,100
What do I do?

122
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,860
To defend me,

123
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,540
Fan argued with the designer.

124
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,500
He's being detained.

125
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,500
What did you do?

126
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,020
I didn't do anything.

127
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,020
It's the designer.

128
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,620
He asked me
to take off my clothes in public.

129
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,380
I...

130
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,340
Zhou Lu.

131
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,060
Don't be impulsive.

132
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,100
That's a crime of passion.

133
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,460
What do we do now?

134
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,620
Will they fight?

135
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:37,980
No.

136
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,780
Let's wait.

137
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,820
If we break in,

138
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,980
we'll be doomed.

139
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,420
Excuse me.

140
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,420
Sorry to interrupt.

141
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,700
Are you the editor-in-chief of Whim?

142
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,540
What's up?

143
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,980
You know Jia Fan, right?

144
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,660
He was almost on your cover.

145
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,740
So, you're Jia Fan?

146
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,220
How dare a model fired by ACME

147
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,140
tell me what to do in my place?

148
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,220
When you don't get a job,

149
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,460
you still love to act the hero.

150
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,940
Who do you think you are?

151
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,980
You should be self-aware enough.

152
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,540
The muscle you have

153
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,780
can't make you successful.

154
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,220
Do you keep me here

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,340
just to humiliate me?

156
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,340
No, actually.

157
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,380
To give you a second chance.

158
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,300
Now,

159
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,540
apologize.

160
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,540
Undress yourself.

161
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,060
You won't?

162
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,660
Then what are you doing here?

163
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,700
I bet you.

164
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,140
This must be the last chance

165
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,660
in your entire career.

166
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Think carefully about it.

167
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,180
You really flatter yourself.

168
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,060
What did you say?

169
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,700
There are villains in every industry.

170
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm quite impressed today.

171
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,260
Jia Fan, I warn you.

172
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,620
Don't push it!

173
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,340
From this day on, I'll ban you.

174
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,460
In this circle,

175
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,660
from now on,

176
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,500
either you or I have to disappear!

177
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,220
Let me see how long you can struggle.

178
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,020
Get out now.

179
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,740
Are you mutinous?

180
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,140
Want to hit me?

181
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,700
Come on. Hit here.

182
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,940
Hit my head.

183
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,980
Today, I'll totally screw you.

184
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,860
Come on. Hit me.

185
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,620
Do it.

186
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,220
Hello, Mr. Jimmy.

187
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,820
Leslie?

188
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Long time no see.

189
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,460
I was waiting out there for a while

190
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,500
but didn't see you.

191
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,140
Sorry, but I had to break in.

192
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,420
You should say sorry.

193
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,340
Yeah.

194
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,900
Then, I'll say more.

195
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,860
Our cooperation for next spring

196
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,980
will be canceled.

197
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,260
What?

198
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,860
The idea of our magazine

199
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,060
doesn't actually accord

200
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,180
with your behaviors

201
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,100
to undress models

202
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
and even insult them.

203
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,340
Come on. I...

204
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,380
Jia Fan, you've lost weight.

205
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,420
You look great.

206
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,020
That's good.

207
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,780
Oh.

208
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,300
As your old partner,

209
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,340
let me give you some advice.

210
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,060
Okay.

211
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,500
This is a small circle.

212
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,660
You should always leave room

213
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,380
and never say never.

214
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,020
You're right.

215
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,660
I...

216
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,380
I...

217
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,540
Come on.

218
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,180
Le... Leslie.

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,650
[Episode 20]
[Chance Favors the Prepared]

220
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,260
Liao Jinyuan.

221
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,140
You're welcome. No problem.

222
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,820
Why did you help me?

223
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,660
I didn't help you.

224
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,180
I just hate it when models are insulted.

225
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,140
After all, when I was a photographer,

226
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,420
I met a lot of models

227
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,100
and I respected them the most.

228
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,220
Anyway,

229
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,860
you kind of avenged me.

230
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,100
Let me buy you a drink.

231
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,020
I don't like to owe anybody.

232
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,060
Especially you.

233
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,140
Still in the interview?

234
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,860
Have you eaten?

235
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,100
Shall we...?

236
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
He must have eaten.

237
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,220
It's late.

238
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,180
How was the interview?
Did it go smoothly?

239
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,900
My job for the cover was done.

240
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,700
It went really smoothly.

241
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,420
What job did you say was perfect for me?

242
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,220
Scriptwriter?

243
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,860
What do you think?

244
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,700
A scriptwriter has to be well-educated.

245
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,460
Forget it, then.

246
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,260
Shall I run a training class?

247
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,540
I have no talent for business.

248
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,900
Designer?

249
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,540
Outfit blogger?

250
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,100
Fashion consultant?

251
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,540
You make your own choice.

252
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Jinyuan suddenly asked me
to get another job.

253
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Does it mean

254
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,540
he's considering our future?

255
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,100
Want to hear the truth?

256
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,020
No.

257
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,500
I'll just think like that.

258
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,100
Then I can be motivated.

259
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,460
Oh my God.

260
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Is my dream coming true?

261
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,580
That's not for this occasion.

262
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,020
Mo.

263
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,940
Such a rare visitor.

264
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,420
He offered to buy me a drink.

265
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,740
So, I brought him over.

266
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,100
You can earn money.

267
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,020
Okay. Take your seats.

268
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,180
Ms. Ling,

269
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,020
please plead with Leslie for me.

270
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,260
I was giving Jia Fan a lesson for you.

271
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,980
Mr. Jimmy.

272
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,060
I didn't know Leslie would see that.

273
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,180
You've been cooperating, right?

274
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,820
He'll spare me for your sake.

275
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,380
Then, I'd really be behind all this.

276
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,580
Are you saying you won't help me?

277
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,980
I can't help.

278
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,980
Don't do anything like that again.

279
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,100
You'll answer for what you did.

280
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,340
Ms. Ling.

281
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,980
Hello?

282
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,300
Do you have super good hearing
or can you read lips?

283
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,940
What are they talking about?

284
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,060
Can you go and drink with them?

285
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,180
Can you just go home?

286
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,540
It must be about Han Yijing.

287
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,700
She's their only common topic.

288
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
You brought me here.

289
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,660
In case I get drunk
and sleep on the plaza again?

290
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,020
How dare you bring it up?

291
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,980
I haven't taken revenge yet.

292
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,500
Because you secretly investigate me.

293
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,020
Tit for tat.

294
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,700
We're even now.

295
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,220
These days,

296
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,260
how do you feel?

297
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,380
Did you regret it?

298
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,700
If I had regretted it,

299
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,420
I wouldn't have screwed
today's interview.

300
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,900
Honestly,

301
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,020
I'm impressed with you.

302
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,940
At this important moment,

303
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,260
you just gave up like that.

304
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,300
If I were half as brave as you,

305
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,940
I wouldn't have...

306
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,020
Don't bring back your memories.

307
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,900
Fine.

308
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,820
I'll look to the future, then.

309
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,260
That's not your concern.

310
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,220
If you make no progress

311
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,100
and fail to make a difference,

312
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,420
I'll get her back.

313
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,940
Oh, my lady.

314
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,380
You are

315
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,940
badly interfering with my business.

316
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,180
Go back, will you?

317
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,980
No. I can't go back.

318
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,540
Whatever you want to do,

319
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,180
give me a warning.

320
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,380
So, I...

321
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,940
There she is.

322
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,900
The heroine has just come.

323
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,100
Then the fun begins.

324
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,340
What's up?

325
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,140
Mind your attitude.

326
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,260
Talk nicely.

327
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
I'll hang up.

328
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,660
Wait a minute.

329
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,460
If you aren't asleep,

330
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,660
come to Xing Mo's bar.

331
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,740
You'll get a big surprise.

332
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,740
Why are you here?

333
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,820
Can I have a word with him?

334
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,260
I'll be quick.

335
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,700
Of course.

336
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,540
Go ahead.

337
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,380
What's going on here?

338
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,140
Why are they talking alone?

339
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,060
You got her here?

340
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,780
Yes.

341
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,660
So, you can

342
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,340
talk face to face.

343
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,380
If you only have to guess,

344
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,540
you'll never know the truth.

345
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,460
You did really a lot for us.

346
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,460
Thank you.

347
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,420
I like Jinyuan.

348
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,220
But I'm 100% on your side.

349
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,540
Trust me.

350
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,500
Just be yourself all the time.

351
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,580
One day, Ms. Ling will comprise.

352
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,420
What a surprise.

353
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,380
You're the first to encourage me.

354
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,260
Because I've been there.

355
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,340
In this world,

356
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,220
no parents are really
against their children.

357
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,860
Would you like another drink?

358
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,660
I'll drink with you.

359
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,660
No.

360
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,260
You can't hold your liquor.

361
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,020
And you're a terrible drunkard.

362
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
But you're around.

363
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,940
So, I'm scared.

364
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,580
Aren't you curious
about our conversation?

365
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,420
I am.

366
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,060
But you don't have to tell me.

367
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,700
You had a private talk.

368
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,500
So you don't want others to know.

369
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,860
How considerate.

370
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,860
So, you didn't contact me

371
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,780
in case you disturbed me, huh?

372
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,500
That's not true.

373
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,340
I was way too busy.

374
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,100
I didn't have time.

375
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,580
I'm worried about you.

376
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,740
I miss you, too.

377
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,580
Sorry.

378
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,460
I was planning to tell you

379
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,940
after I got some good news.

380
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,300
But good news didn't come.

381
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,940
I just want news, whatever it is.

382
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
You promised me.

383
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
You'll keep me informed

384
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,860
of anything.

385
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,900
It won't happen again.

386
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,380
You must keep your word.

387
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,380
Pinky promise.

388
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,700
How childish.

389
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,580
Because it's you.

390
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,500
I won't be childish to anyone else.

391
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,940
Come on.

392
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,340
Where are we going?

393
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,580
We'll do something more childish.

394
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,020
Boxing?

395
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,620
My great tool for relaxing.

396
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,020
Every time I was stressed out,

397
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,580
or felt upset,

398
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,700
I came here alone.

399
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,700
After I punched, I'd feel great.

400
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,980
Have a try.

401
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,540
Personally and professionally,

402
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,780
I won't let you two be together.

403
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,700
And you can forget about

404
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,140
ever stepping into
the modeling industry again.

405
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,700
People fired from ACME

406
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,820
have a hard time finding another job.

407
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
From this day on,

408
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,940
either you or I have to disappear!

409
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
If you still fail,

410
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,300
you can't blame me anymore.

411
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,820
No matter if you're at ACME or not,

412
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,380
you'll always be our comrade.

413
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,260
We'll always support you.

414
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,380
If you make no progress

415
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,620
and fail to make a difference,

416
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,740
I'll get her back.

417
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,460
Fan's father doesn't know it, huh?

418
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,580
We can't let him know.

419
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,900
Don't slip it out.

420
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,540
Or Fan will kill me.

421
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,540
Don't always

422
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,420
call him that.

423
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,540
Behave like a girl, okay?

424
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,700
Or I'll really hit you someday.

425
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,500
Uncle Jia.

426
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,580
Come on. Breakfast is ready.

427
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,780
I don't think

428
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,660
I should always bother you like this.

429
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,260
That's inappropriate.

430
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,020
We hired someone to help.

431
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,820
There'll be plenty of time.

432
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,700
Fan won't be held up
from chasing his dream.

433
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,700
As for you,

434
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,300
stay at home and enjoy a great life.

435
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,740
What dream?

436
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,100
It was ruined, wasn't it?

437
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,260
I didn't say anything.

438
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,860
So, it's true.

439
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,180
Actually,

440
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,340
I felt it pretty early on.

441
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
He always goes out early
and comes home late.

442
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,540
He seems busy.

443
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,340
But he talks much less now.

444
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,740
He doesn't eat as much as before.

445
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,300
When I passed his room
in the middle of the night,

446
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,860
I heard noises.

447
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,260
He has been sleepless.

448
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,900
He must be in trouble.

449
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,380
Or he wouldn't do this.

450
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,180
Uncle Jia...

451
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,860
All right.

452
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,500
Since he doesn't want me to know,

453
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,460
I'll pretend I don't know.

454
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,940
Let him be.

455
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,020
What's the old saying again?

456
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,500
Everyone has his own life.

457
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,020
That's right.

458
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,100
Let's eat.

459
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,340
Or it'll get cold.

460
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Go wake Fan up.

461
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,420
I'm on it.

462
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,740
Keep your voice down.

463
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Don't irritate Jia Fan.

464
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,220
I know.

465
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,940
Time for breakfast.

466
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,180
Eating more whole grains.

467
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,340
Fan.

468
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,660
Jia Fan.

469
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,020
Get up and have breakfast.

470
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,580
Still sleeping?

471
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,700
Say something, or I'll come in.

472
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,660
Han Yijing?

473
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,580
Morning, Mr. Peter.

474
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,660
What makes you out of breath?

475
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,340
I'm exercising to gain strength.

476
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,660
For what?

477
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,460
You're banned.

478
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,060
You won't even have interviews.

479
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,180
You don't need strength.

480
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Do you have any plans?

481
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Shall I

482
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,940
get you another job?

483
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,820
No need.

484
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,300
You know what, Jia?

485
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,660
You don't have a choice,

486
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,380
understand?

487
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,900
Will you really proceed without a plan?

488
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,980
I'm a lucky guy, you know.

489
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,180
Maybe...

490
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,860
Wake up.

491
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,940
I'll tell you what.

492
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,100
You only have a few years
for your prime.

493
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,780
Take my advice.

494
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,820
Don't be so stubborn.

495
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,340
Surrender when you have to.

496
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,300
You know what?

497
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,500
When you get a great chance,

498
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,260
there won't be any trouble. Got it?

499
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,860
Hello.

500
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,620
Hello?

501
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
If I'm not given a chance,
I'll create one.

Thanks, Mr. Peter.

506
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,020
Hello?

507
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,860
What did he say?

508
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,940
What did he say?

509
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,980
Nothing, actually.

510
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,380
He sounded confusing.

511
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,500
I don't know what he was talking about.

512
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,220
He must be frustrated now.

513
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,020
Oh no.

514
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,100
It's all over.

515
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,700
You know what? There's no hope.

516
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,940
Jia Fan

517
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,820
offended Ms. Ling

518
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,900
and then annoyed Jimmy.

519
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,740
They're good friends.

520
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,620
They know each other.

521
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,540
If they make a statement together,

522
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,660
no one will dare to hire him.

523
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,140
Did Ms. Ling also tell Jimmy to do that?

524
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,300
Wait a minute.

525
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,900
What do you mean "also"?

526
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,180
I mean...

527
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,820
Maybe...

528
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,740
Maybe...

529
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,900
Before,

530
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,820
I got Jia Fan some interviews,

531
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,500
you know?

532
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,380
Interviewers spoke highly of him.

533
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,540
But for no reason, he didn't get a job.

534
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,460
Not even a single one.

535
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,340
Drive me back to ACME.

536
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,820
Why?

537
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,500
Turn it around!

538
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,660
Come... Come on.

539
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,780
We're just guessing.

540
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,260
Maybe Ms. Ling isn't behind all this.

541
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
We're just kidding, Yijing.

542
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,380

it won't do anybody any good.

That's right.

553
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,700
If she had cared for you,

554
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,380
she wouldn't have fired Jia Fan.

555
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,780
So, you know why he was fired.

556
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,700
We...

557
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,900

You aren't responsible.

Don't follow me.

560
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,500
But I'm responsible for both of you.

561
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,860
Very well.

562
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,180
See?

563
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,820
When she's in love,

564
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,820
no one can stop her.

565
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,740
We have to try, anyway.

566
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,700
We can't let them have a big fight.

567
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,220
Since we can't stop her,

568
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
let's try something else.

569
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,100
For example?

570
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,620
It's the current proposal.

571
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,380
This is the case now.

572
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,700
Yeah. I think we should do something

573
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,180
on the...

574
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,020
I'll communicate with them.

575
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,420
You guys talk.

576
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,940
I have nothing to say about Jia Fan.

577
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,420
I made my point.

578
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,220
I also told you

579
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,580
I'd make you regret it

580
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,980
if you gave him trouble.

581
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,660
I don't have a choice.

582
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,740
I have your temper.

583
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,340
I'll be heartless when I have to.

584
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,140
Are you threatening me?

585
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,740
Yes.

586
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,020
Like how you threatened Jia Fan.

587
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,380
I did that for you.

588
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,540
No need.

589
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,980
First Liao Jinyuan and then Jia Fan.

590
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,300
When I loved someone,

591
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,660
you would try hard to destroy them!

592
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,260
You forced Liao
to stay abroad for three years.

593
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,180
Now, you've expelled Jia Fan.

594
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
You always give him trouble

595
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,740
and make him desperate.

596
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,580
Why?

597
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,900
Do I have to be all alone?

598
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,820
Do I have to live your life?

599
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,620
I'll say it again.

600
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,260
You can have a boyfriend.

601
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,940
But it can't be Jia Fan.

602
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,100
Why?

603
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,420
Isn't that obvious?

604
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,460
Because I'm your aunt.

605
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,260
I won't hurt you in any case,

606
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,940
understand?

607
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,380
But do you know...

608
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,180
you're always the one who tortures me

609
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,860
and nearly kills me?

610
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
Ever since I was little...

611
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,220
you've been forcing me
to live by your standards.

612
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,740
From my weight to my sleep schedule,

613
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,780
who I can be friends with,

614
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,300
and who I can date.

615
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,620
You just want me to succeed.

616
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,980
But I'm a person.

617
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,020
I want to live my own life.

618
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,100
So, I beg you.

619
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,340
Let me go, okay?

620
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,260
Yijing,

621
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,940
I promise you.

622
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,300
I'll do anything you want.

623
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,580
But in this case, you must listen to me.

624
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,580
You could hate me

625
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,060
rather than regret it someday.

626
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,740
What I regret most is...

627
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,740
I've been with you.

628
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,460
Stop threatening me

629
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,380
as my family.

630
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,700
Basically...

631
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm a mere commodity

632
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,980
and a tool you use to earn money.

633
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,780
I can't have a boyfriend!

634
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,620
I must be perfect!

635
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,380
Why?

636
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,220
Because profit matters most!

637
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,300
Are you insane?

638
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,820
I would rather not

639
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,900
have a family like you.

640
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
Am I interrupting?

641
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,340
Let me give you a brief of my work.

642
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,100
From this day on,

643
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,140
I'll fully embrace life
as an online content creator.

644
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,260
I'll start a video channel

645
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,140
where I do everything myself.

646
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,660
It's about outfits and runway shows.

647
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,620
Occasionally, I'll show some talents

648
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
to fully present

649
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,420
an unknown model's real life.

650
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,100
What do you say?

651
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,540
Good.

652
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,700
That's all?

653
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,780
Any advice for me?

654
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,220
You'd better rely on yourself.

655
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,060
I have faith in you.

656
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,340
I get it.

657
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,820
Who was that?

658
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,940
You freaked me out.

659
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,100
Who were you calling?

660
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,980
Your girlfriend?

661
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,100
Go home.

662
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,740
Or it'll be dark.

663
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,300
Answer my question.

664
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,460
Or I'll quit

665
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,860
and let you work alone.

666
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,140
It's not that I don't tell you.

667
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,660
I just fear you'll be appalled.

668
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,420
Appalled?

669
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,500
Can it really be...?

670
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,900
Han...

671
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,740
Han Yi...

672
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,740
It can't be her.

673
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,500
Why?

674
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
She isn't blind.

675
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,540
Dong Xiaoru, I'm warning you, seriously.

676
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,860
Oh, I know.

677
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,380
You have a crush on her.

678
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,380
A lot of men have a crush on her.

679
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,500
Why was I fired alone?

680
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,100
But it makes some sense.

681
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,660
We're in love secretly.

682
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,780
What?

683
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,900
Listen.

684
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,060
People may gossip.

685
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,660
So, don't tell anyone. Do you hear?

686
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,380
Come on, Jia Fan.

687
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,340
You should've told me
in the first place.

688
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,420
Do you know I could

689
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,300
hardly eat or sleep these days?

690
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,380
If I had known how you lost your job,

691
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,460
I would have some champagne

692
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,260
and drink it day and night!

693
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,860
I'm warning you again.

694
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,140
Don't worry.

695
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,260
For Yijing,

696
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
I won't tell anyone.

697
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,060
Rest assured.

698
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,140
Count on me for the account thing.

699

00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,460
We broke the record.

762
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
It's just the pre-sale.

763
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,780
We'll make a new record
when it's officially released.

764
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,860
Mr. Liao, congrats on the victory.

765
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,060
The same to you.

766
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,340
Thanks for your hard work.

767
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,220
I've brought some afternoon tea.

768
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,340
I didn't expect to see so many of you.

769
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,380
Only one piece.

770
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,060
I'm going to work.

771
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,220
I think they've got us wrong.

772
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,700
Glad to know that.

773
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,700
Jinyuan.

774
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,540
Afternoon tea for you.

775
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,180
Congrats on the massive sales.

776
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,460
How do you know?

777
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,380
I heard it at the door.

778
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,340
I guess everybody
in this building knows it now.

779
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,460
Thank you.

780
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,180
I'll finally sleep tight.

781
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,420
Han Yijing is awesome indeed.

782
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,660
It's been three years.

783
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,540
But she's as influential as before.

784
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,100
If someone else were on the cover,

785
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,700
it wouldn't sell so well.

786
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,700
Right?

787
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,100
You aren't good at this.

788
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,060
Get to the point.

789
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,300
That night,

790
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,140
what did she say to you?

791
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,340
Come on, that day.

792
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,260
At Xing Mo's bar.

793
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,860
Jia Fan and I were also there.

794
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,100
You didn't hear us?

795
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,540
How could I hear you?

796
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,260
I don't have super good hearing.

797
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm relieved, then.

798
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,100
Jinyuan.

799
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:35,980
All right.

800
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,180
I'll have a meeting.

801
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,220
The food is here. You should leave.

802
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,700
Then...

803
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,700
You eat it up.

804
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,300
I will.

805
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,140
Don't share it with anyone else.

806
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,780
I won't.

807
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
I should go.

808
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,500
Stay safe.

809
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,540
Oh.

810
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,340
Not only did your magazine
sell well today,

811
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,700
Jia Fan's video also got
over 10,000 views.

812
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,660
I shared the link on my Moments.

813
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,700
Watch it when you have time.

814
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,820
Give it a "like" and follow his account.

815
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,860
