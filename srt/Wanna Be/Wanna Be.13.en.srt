Can you handle this? Be honest.

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,980
Ms. Ling, I'm okay.

4
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,500
I'll be all right soon.

Jia Fan.

6
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,700
Don't forget. You represent ACME,

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,420
not yourself.

8
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,540
I'm really all right.

00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,900
Then take off your hoodie.

How do you know?

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,140
You can't keep a lid on this.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,020
For whatever reason,

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,660
he should go to the hospital now.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,340
I gave him emergency treatment.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,780
This isn't an ordinary shooting.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,460
He won't just pose or act cool.

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,860
As you can see,

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,060
it'll be harder and more exhausting.

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,860
Are you sure he can make it to the end?

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,420
None of your business.

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,780
Do you want him
to spend the rest of his life like you?

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,460
He's still young.

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,860
There will be plenty of chances.

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
This isn't the only chance.

Let me replace him.

When I trained with him,

31
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,980
I went through all the moves.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,860
I can take it over.

33

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,100
you saw what I just did.

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,060
If I had managed to endure,
I wouldn't have stopped.

38
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,540
It's not about the endurance.

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,980
I promise

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,380
I won't affect the shoot.

41
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,740
I won't cause trouble for ACME.

42
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,380
Your safety matters too.

Now, you're all right.

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,980
I'm a terrible man.

194
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,780
I'm despicable and awful.

195
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,020
I can never outperform a saint like you!

196
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,500
So, you don't deserve to be my buddy.

197
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,420
Get lost now.

198
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,020
Don't worry.

199
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,540
I answer for whatever I do.

200
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,260
Tomorrow, I'll tell Ms. Ling the truth!

201
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,820
You won't be involved!

202
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,100
Get lost!

203
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,700
I heard

204
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,220
the shoot went smoothly today.

205
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,700
It was finished ahead of time.

206
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,620
Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhang
were satisfied, too.

207
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,740
Xing Mo...

208
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,940
Actually,

209
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,020
I wasn't sure If I could hold on.

210
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,180
I just didn't want to give up.

211
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,060
Luckily, Mo was there.

212
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,260
Or the consequences would be dire.

213
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,300
No wonder you kept telling me

214
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,580
it was hard to be a model

215
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,980
and asked me not to get involved.

216
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,140
So, the work isn't complicated.

217
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,420
The people are.

218
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,660
At first, I also suspected him.

219
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,940
I was too anxious

220
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,980
to think about it.

221
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,740
He reminded me, though.

222
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,740
I've known him for ten years.

223
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,460
Actually,

224
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,660
besides you and the doctor,

225
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,620
he also knows my problem.

226
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,500
But he's never told anyone.

227
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,300
Not even me.

228
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,580
So, I should have trusted him.

229
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,460
He isn't a wicked guy.

230
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,380
He's just like me.

231
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,940
He never explains.

232
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,260
He doesn't care what people think.

233
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,500
He only does what he should do.

234
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,540
He appears to be unapproachable.

235
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,260
He even looks unkind.

236
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,380
But actually,

237
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,300
he's very trustworthy.

238
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,900
Run!

239
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,620
If we have a fight,

240
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,140
just run away.

241
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,420
Don't say that.

242
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,700
I'll just fight.

243
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,460
Hit them.

244
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,300
Dazhuang!

245
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,980
Loser.

246
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,260
Hey, Miss.

247
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,140
We're fighting.

248
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,860
Stay away.

249
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,100
Why did you come again?

250
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,340
You needn't have.

251
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,100
I'll check out tomorrow.

252
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,620
After that,

253
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,180
what will you do?

254
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,860
Why do you ask?

255
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,060
All alone,

256
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,860
you left your hometown.

257
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,740
Then you...

258
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,940
How do you know this isn't my hometown?

259
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,060
I also know
you just had your 19th birthday.

260
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,020
Come on.

261
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,540
Who are you?

262
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,300
Did Dazhuang tell you?

263
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,420
Don't be silly.

264
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,100
I brought you to the hospital

265
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
and checked in with your ID card.

266
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,540
To settle down here,

267
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,820
you have to make a living.

268
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,500
You need a stable job.

269
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,220
How do you know I don't have a job?

270
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,940
Does my ID card say that?

271
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,460
When you're in hospital,

272
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
nobody but me

273
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,020
has visited you.

274
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,580
People usually get

275
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,380
two kinds of jobs.

276
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,300
What they're good at
or what they're fit for.

277
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,300
You're tall

278
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,020
and well-proportioned.

279
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,060
You can be a good model.

280
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,780
If you're interested, give it a try.

281
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,980
Model?

282
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,620
Sounds flashy.

283
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,060
Not interested.

284
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,340
That's at least better

285
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,380
than fighting with punks.

286
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,780
This is my business card.

287
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,420
If you want the old life,

288
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,540
throw it away

289
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,780
and forget all about it.

290
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,100
But if you want a new life,

291
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,780
call me.

292
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,660
Anytime.

293
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,340
Do you really think I can be a model?

294
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,060
Or is it because I saved you?

295
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,300
Young man,

296
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,500
it costs a lot to foster a model.

297
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,580
I'm a merchant,

298
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,740
not a philanthropist.

299
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,220
Think about it.

300
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,060
I'll wait for your call.

301
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,060
Miss.

302
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,980
I'll think about it.

303
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,780
You handled my medical bills.

304
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,660
I'll pay you back when I earn money.

305
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,820
No need.

306
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,740
You saved me, after all.

307
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,500
We're even now.

308
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,820
Are you disappointed in me?

309
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,580
You tried so hard to promote Jia Fan,

310
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,700
but I ruined your plan.

311
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,500
You worked the whole day.
Why haven't you...?

312
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,060
What happened to your hand?

313
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,060
I pretended to be nice.

314
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,580
But I didn't tell him
about the schedule change.

315
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,900
So, he was late and injured.

316
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,180
Then, I replaced him.

317
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,020
So what?

318
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,740
I used to be a punk, after all.

319
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,420
People just are who they are.

320
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,580
Yeah.

321
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,780
That's who you are.

322
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,580
You always give up when you slip up.

323
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,340
And you never explain anything.

324
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
You didn't even know

325
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,700
about the schedule change.

326
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,500
Someone else answered the phone.

327
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,260
You replaced Jia Fan just to help him

328
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,460
as well as ACME.

329
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,180
Am I right?

330
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,220
Be straightforward, okay?

331
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,620
Why must you...? Why?

332
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
I did everything for you.

333
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,020
Straightforward enough, huh?

334
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,780
I defended him,
helped him in the training,

335
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,580
and replaced him shamelessly,

336
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,140
no matter what others thought.

337
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,340
It's all because of you.

338
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Xing Mo, I'll...

339
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,340
You brought me into this industry.

340
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,020
Without you,

341
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,420
I might not even be alive now.

342
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,460
So,

343
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,580
I can do anything for you.

344
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,100
I'll just repay you.

345
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,700
Fine.

346
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,940
But you should stop from here.

347
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,740
We're even now.

348
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,540
You saved me, after all.

349
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,460
We're even now.

350
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,480
♪I accompany you in silence♪

351
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,450
♪Until the dawn♪

352
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:43,140
♪I accompany you in silence♪

353
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,110
♪Until the dawn♪

354
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,020
How do you feel now? Any better?

355
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,220
You'll sleep, huh?

356
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,180
Don't underestimate me.

357
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,900
I think you're right.

358
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,820
There will be plenty of chances.

359
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,940
But Mo is the one and only.

360
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,820
So, I trust him.

361
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
You're so gullible.

362
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,220
You believe me so easily.

363
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,060
Yes.

364
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,900
I believe whatever you say.

365
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,700
It's late.

366
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,060
Go home.

367
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,580
My legs are numb.

368
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,380
Can you walk me up?

369
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,100
Okay.

370
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,300
Come on.

371
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,340
Your father must be asleep.

372
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,500
If he knows...

373
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,380
He won't know.

374
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
He has poor eyesight.

375
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,220
Can it be cured?

376
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,020
Yes, of course.

377
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,980
He'll watch my show.

378
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,860
My show with Ms. Han.

379
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,140
You go up, then.

380
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,620
I...

381
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,140
I'll go home.

382
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,820
Come on.

383
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,100
Just come.

384
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,740
What for?

385
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Enjoy the night scene with me.

386
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
What scene?

387
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,940
Look up.

388
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,540
So many stars.

389
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,620
In the city,

390
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,060
we can only see countless car lights.

391
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,580
And crowds.

392
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,820
I haven't seen so many stars for years.

393
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,140
That's because you always look down.

394
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,020
The stars are up in the sky.

395
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,580
You have to look up at them.

396
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,180
So, you're a philosopher.

397
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,580
And a psychologist.

398
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,100
You helped me a lot at work.

399
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,940
I should help you in life too.

400
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,700
I've never been to your flat.

401
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,100
But I can imagine that.

402
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,740
A wall of floor-to-ceiling windows.

403
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Customized furniture.

404
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,820
Designed clothes.

405
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,980
If I lived in this kind of flat,

406
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,020
I'd even laugh in my dream.

407
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,660
So, are you working so hard

408
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,500
just to move into that kind of flat?

409
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,180
Of course.

410
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,900
When my father isn't too old,

411
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,620
I must give him a great life.

412
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,900
Too bad.

413
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,660
My mother died at a young age.

414
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,620
But it's okay.

415
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,580
She passed away when I was eight.

416
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,500
I've moved on.

417
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,540
In life,

418
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,740
there are always regrets.

419
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,460
My biggest regret is

420
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
that I've never seen my father.

421
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
I didn't make my mother proud, either.

422
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,180
My parents

423
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,020
divorced shortly after my birth.

424
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,580
I lived with my mother.

425
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
When I was six,

426
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,580
she would go abroad.

427
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,780
Then, she left me with my aunt.

428
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,340
I didn't get any news of her

429
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,580
until I was 20.

430
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,700
It was her death certificate.

431
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,780
A car accident killed her.

432
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,460
Oh.

433
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,020
My aunt

434
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,740
is Ms. Ling.

435
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,580
My only family is my boss.

436
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,180
And she's a workaholic.

437
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
So, when I turned 18,

438
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,220
I moved out and lived alone.

439
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,940
I've been living

440
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,340
a free and happy life.

441
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,780
Why do you look at me like that?

442
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,740
What's gone is gone.

443
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,380
I'm the hottest supermodel,

444
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,860
Han Yijing.

445
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,740
I'm famous, rich, and gorgeous.

446
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,380
And...

447
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,500
And you have me.

448
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,660
A die-hard fan
who supports you unconditionally,

449
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,900
a promising apprentice

450
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,660
and a personal therapist.

451
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
I'm also a friend

452
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,660
who knows you very well.

453
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Jia Fan,

454
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm still cold.

455
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,740
What about now?

456
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,260
Hello.

457
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,420
Okay. I get it.

458
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,540
I know what to do.

459
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,380
Stay out of this. I'll hang up.

460
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,740
It was Shubo.

461
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,140
He said there would be
a party next Friday afternoon.

462
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,260
A welcome party

463
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,420
for Whim China.

464
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
I need to bring a date.

465
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,180
Okay.

466
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,900
You lost the ad job.

467
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,380
I was partly at fault.

468
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,260
So, you'll be my date.

469
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,620
As compensation.

470
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,460
What? You don't want it?

471
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,740
If you don't go,

472
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,700
more guys will do.

473
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,260
A lot more.

474
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,020
So, I accepted your invitation.

475
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,540
Then rest and get well.

476
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,940
Or you may not even wear a suit.

477
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,460
Ms. Han.

478
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,980
Are you done talking?

479
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,540
