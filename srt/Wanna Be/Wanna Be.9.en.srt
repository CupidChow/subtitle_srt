00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,580
You can take a beating, you can bleed,

190
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,980
but your battle gear can't be ruined.

191
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,300
I hope you don't ever fail again,

192
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,340
and keep succeeding.

193
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,780
Thank you.

194
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,020
Here, Fan.

195
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,020
This is from me.

196
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Please accept it.

197
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,540
It's so heavy.

198
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,620
The miser finally gave something.

199
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,300
Ms. Dong, look.

200
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,060
A scale?

201
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,860
Uncle Jia, you really know
how to give gifts.

202
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,180
As Xiaoru said,

203
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,300
modeling

204
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,140
looks easy, but is actually very hard.

205
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,420
Many people

206
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,380
give up halfway.

207
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,780
I gave you this scale

208
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,940
to remind you

209
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,700
that you chose this path yourself,

210
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,300
so you must persevere.

211
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,780
If you encounter difficulties
that you can't overcome,

212
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,380
then just enjoy.

213
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,140
Success or failure doesn't matter,

214
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,980
as long as you don't regret it.

215
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,340
Well said.

216
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Really well said.

217
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,460
It's just a pity

218
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,740
that today is a BBQ party

219
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,500
and you gave your son a scale.

220
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,660
Today, it's Ms. Dong's treat.

221
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,900
She went all out.

222
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,420
Eat to your heart's content.

223
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,260
Okay.

224
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,300
Let's put this aside first.

225
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,340
Today, it's all about BBQ.

226
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,420
Right.

227
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,020
You were doing so well at the shop,

228
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,060
why did you have to become a model?

229
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,420
It's obvious

230
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,900
that it must've been
Dong Xiaoru's bad influence.

231
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,780
Is being a model

232
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,740
something anyone can do?

233
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,100
We're doing this

234
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,940
because others can't.

235
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,220
My son is no ordinary.

236
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,980
Who does he take after?

237
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,820
After my dad.

238
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,500
You can tell

239
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,780
he's definitely your son.

240
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,540
Jia Fan.

241
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,700
Present.

242
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm warning you,

243
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
you can chase your dreams,

244
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,340
but don't neglect your job.

245
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,460
Mom.

246
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,380
Before you achieve your dream,

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,780
if you dare to quit your job,

248
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,860
I'll take away your shares

249
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,820
and fire you.

250
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,820
Got it?

251
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,580
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,340
Mom.

253
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,420
Dad.

254
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,300
Mom, you're amazing.

255
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,620
Now you think I'm amazing?

256
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,300
Quick, keep grilling skewers
for your amazing mom.

257
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,660
Jia Fan. Go, get to work.

258
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,540
Come on, chef.

259
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,860
Isn't today my celebration party?

260
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,860
Everyone loves the skewers you grill.

261
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,500
Quickly.

262
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,060
Go on.

263
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,780
Come on, bring the meat.

264
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,420
That one.

265
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,220
The skewers are pretty great.

266
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,340
I think today's skewers

267
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,780
are the most successful ones to date.

268
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,700
Of course.

269
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,820
Come on.

270
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,540
Cheers.

271
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,180
Come on.

272
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,140
Cheers.

273
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,260
Cheers.

274
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,100
Fan.

275
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,380
I'm happy for you.

276
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,100
Keep it up.

277
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,660
Ladies and gentlemen.

278
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,900
Let's welcome our supermodel, Mr. Jia,

279
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,820
to showcase

280
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,340
his runway walk.

281
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,700
Not bad.

282
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,420
So handsome!

283
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,780
This citrus and lemon flower tea
just came in.

284
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,140
Remember to drink it.

285
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,540
Next time you come,

286
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,540
could you let me know in advance?

287
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,900
It's so late, why are you still up?

288
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,620
Is everything okay?

289
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,220
You Ning should be the one
who isn't okay.

290
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,500
You should care more about her.

291
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,300
If,

292
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,940
I mean, if...

293
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,820
Never mind.

294
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,900
The contract with Rachel
has been finalized.

295
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
We can sign anytime.

296
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,820
Also,

297
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,980
make sure you're in great condition
these few days.

298
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,820
Go to bed early.

299
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,700
If what?

300
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,860
I can't sleep if you don't tell me.

301
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,740
If...

302
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,860
If you had gone abroad
with your mom back then,

303
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,220
would you still have chosen this career?

304
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,980
You would.

305
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,460
You were born to be a model.

306
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,460
Otherwise,
you would've given up three years ago.

307
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,260
What are you trying to say?

308
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,540
You chose this path.

309
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,380
I didn't force you.

310
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,700
Everything I've done

311
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,900
has been to help you.

312
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,260
So,

313
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,580
stop being so moody with me.

314
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,700
Also,

315
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,100
no matter what happens in the future,

316
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,140
don't let anything shake you.

317
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Don't let anyone or anything

318
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,700
hold you back.

319
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,180
If you really can't do it,

320
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,180
just think about those three years.

321
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,300
Huang Jinde.

322
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,820
Long time no see.

323
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,140
Didn't recognize me?

324
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,660
Looks like my disguise worked.

325
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Rachel really hit you hard, huh?

326
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,940
What's the matter?

327
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Why did we have to meet in person?

328
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,340
I wanted to personally deliver
a big gift to you.

329
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,700
This is...?

330
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,900
Han Yijing?

331
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,100
Who's that next to her?

332
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,340
Jia Fan.

333
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,500
A new face.

334
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,380
This is it?

335
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Isn't this enough?

336
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,060
Han Yijing, under the guise of work,

337
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,420
is secretly meeting
a young guy at night.

338
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,300
Sis,

339
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,860
you're so naive.

340
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,940
First of all, this photo

341
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,940
is so blurry
you can't see anyone clearly.

342
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,100
Even if they were photographed
holding hands entering a hotel,

343
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,540
they could just say
they're good friends.

344
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,260
So to expose something,

345
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,380
either hit them hard
with solid evidence

346
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,260
or...

347
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,380
stay put.

348
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,220
Otherwise, you'll just end up

349
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,420
giving them free publicity

350
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,820
and causing trouble for yourself.

351
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
Not worth it.

352
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,660
Alright.

353
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,740
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

354
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,460
If there's any news,

355
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,940
I'll let you know immediately.

356
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,460
As for whether
you can land a fatal blow,

357
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,220
that's up to you.

358
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,900
Although

359
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,940
I've always

360
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,540
had a hard time swallowing this,

361
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,500
this is really risky.

362
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,780
Besides,

363
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,380
models aren't celebrities.

364
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,380
Not many people
care about their private lives.

365
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,780
You...

366
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,380
I want Rachel to care.

367
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,220
The contract is about to be signed.

368
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,740
A ticking time bomb.

369
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,980
Let's see if they dare.

370
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,060
That's it.

371
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,380
I pay, and you do the work.

372
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
If we can cooperate, great.

373
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,300
If not,

374
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,460
there are plenty of other options.

375
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,580
Call me when you've made up your mind.

376
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,140
Time's ticking.

377
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,660

to eat chicken feet at night?

516
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,780
A hundred grams of grilled chicken feet

517
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,380
has about 150 calories.

518
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,460
If we eat a whole plate,

519
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,060
it's about 350 calories.

520
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,660
But with efficient exercise,

521
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,060
we can burn up to 460 calories,

522
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,100
which means,

523
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,140
the calories we consume

524
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,820

531
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,580

The so-called "self-management"

537
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,220
