00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,780
I didn't know you were so filial.

3
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,300
Are you falling for me again?

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,060
I'm not as great a son as you think.

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,620
He's the only reason
that I can carry on.

6
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,500
Put it down.

7
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,620
I have something to tell you.

8
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,580
Sorry.

9
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,220
Sorry for what happened that night.

10
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,980
It may sound cheesy

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,420
but it was the alcohol.

12
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,780
You know,

13
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,980
after drinking,

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,740
people are easily losing control,

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,340
not knowing what they are doing.

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,740
But I'm not the kind of person

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,100
who takes advantage of newcomers

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,620
or even forces them
to take a casting couch

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,660
only because I'm a senior
in this line of work.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,300
After one glass of champagne?

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,860
People make mistakes.

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,700
Just consider me crazy.

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,180
But that wasn't sexual harassment.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,740
Sexual harassment?

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,780
Stop with the smile.

26
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,940
I'm serious.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,300
Just take it

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,260
as a lesson I gave you.

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,820
People kiss sometimes

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,220
when they do commercials anyway.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,980
This excuse is barely acceptable.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,940
Jia Fan,

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,180
I have apologized.

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,700
How about this?

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,340
I'll help you prepare
for the shooting for Rachel.

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,300
And you

37
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,060
forget about anything that happened.

38
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,300
Wipe it off the board.

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,500
OK?

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,740
Alright, then.

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,940
I promise

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,860
not to file a lawsuit against you
for sexual harassment.

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,660
However, you want me
to pretend nothing happened?

44
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,980
Impossible.

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,100
I have always

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,180
had a good memory since young.

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,420
I can't help it.

48
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,180

[The Secret that Cannot be Told]

51
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,020
Is Whim's cover set?

52
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,740
Not yet.

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,380
All agencies are keeping an eye on it.

54
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Have you found out about
the editor-in-chief?

55
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,220
No.

56
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,100
Whim is keeping it highly confidential.

57
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,420
No info has been leaked.

58
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,460
I assume too many people
are trying to take a peep

59
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,300
so the editor-in-chief has to hide away.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,100
It's pretty good though.

61
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,420
No one can do anything.

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,780
Fair enough.

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,660
How's Rachel's photo shoot going?

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,780

It's all set.

68
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,380
Perhaps she heard about Ding Chen

69
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,100
and some gossip.

70
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,340
She may think only when Jia Fan
nails it in the mission

71
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,740
can the whole thing
move to the next page.

She's doing it
for the sake of the company.

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
She's given a lot of thought to it.

Hello, Tina.

75
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,020

It's really you.

You've gotten prettier.

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,700
I can barely recognize you.

81

Despite your sweet talk,

82
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,300
you didn't even tell me
when you came back.

83
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,620
My schedule is full.

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,820
I was planning to ask you out

85
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,380
after I finish dealing with
the trivial matters.

86
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
That's more like it.

87
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,020
Finally, I got you, huh?

88
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
Did I interrupt you?

89
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,660
Not at all.

90
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,140
Come on. Take a seat.

91
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,620
Oh, right.

92
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,060
How did you find me?

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,940
I went to your office

94
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
but they told me you weren't there.

95
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,660
Then I remembered
you used to work in a coffee shop

96
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,380
and this place is your usual spot,

97
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,260
so I thought I could try my luck here.

98
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,380
You know me the best.

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,100
I have to, you know?

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,580
Ever since I came back,

101
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,980
people have never stopped visiting.

102
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,340
And they are my old friends.

103
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,380
I can't shut them out.

104
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,980
They keep coming

105
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
and I can't get my hands
on my work at all.

106
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,220
That's why I have to hide in here.

107
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,500
No wonder.

108
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,220
It's because of

109
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,300
the first issue, right?

110
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,740
Indeed.

111
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,260
I'm exhausted.

112
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,860

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,020
What is this?

115
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,580
Take a look.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,260
The co-branded bag of Manolo?

117
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,980
How did you get this?

118
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,700
As long as I want something,

119
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,420
I can always get it.

120
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,260
Are you doing this

121
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,060
for the first issue as well?

122
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,500
I can't do anything about it.

123
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,420
I'm just an executive editor.

124
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,780
Honestly, I can only aid
the editor-in-chief.

125
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,340
I don't have the final say.

126
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,820
Well,

127
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,540
who is the editor-in-chief?

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,300
I know nothing

129
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,460
more than you do.

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,340

This is your birthday present.

It's almost the 18th,

134
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,820

138
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,020
I'll happily accept it.

139

Thank you.

Are you sure?

141
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,380
Gently, gently.

142
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
It won't work that way.

143
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,740

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,660
Is this necessary?

except for what's captured
by the camera,

154
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
so it has to be perfect.

155
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,260

the theme of this commercial.

Mr. Chen.

We have less than a week now

165
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,660
and I think...

166
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,100
You know,

167
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,060
we will arrange for a stunt double

168
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,780
but to guarantee the visual effect,

169
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,340
he has to learn the basics.

170

Make time to practice

171
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,580
and figure something out, OK?

172

Besides the visual effect,

173
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,260

175
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,020
give us more time?

176

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,980
A few days ago,

191
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,340
Ms. Han gave me some training.

192
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,620
I can handle it.

193
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,220
Han Yijing?

194
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,900
How did she know?

195
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,780
She said Rachel must have chosen me

196
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,460
to handle either the facial cleanser
or sunscreen.

197
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,740
Whichever it is,
sports will play a part.

198
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,460
Others are easy.

199
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,540
Skateboarding is the hardest to handle,

200
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,180
so we prepared in advance,

201
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,020
just in case.

202
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,580
Experience is indeed valuable.

203
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,380
She's helped a lot.

204
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,860
Go back to the company

205
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,660
and focus on practicing.

206
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,420
OK.

207
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,340
Hire a coach for him.

208
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,340
From today onward,

209
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,180
clear his schedule

210
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,340
except for the training.

211
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,220
Don't trouble Han Yijing especially.

212
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,540
OK.

213
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,980
You're pushing yourself too hard.

214
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,860
Are you going to quit
after this commercial?

215
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,260
Mo.

216
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,820
I thought I was all right
at the beginning.

217
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,340
But when the coach was here,

218
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,460
I just crumbled.

219
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,100
The coach is to show you how.

220
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,540
To be frank,

221
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,540
he shows you
how to pretend to be like him.

222
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,580
So your priority

223
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,780
is to pretend to be as good,

224
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,180
not to practice the skills for real.

225
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,140
I know.

226
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,220
I want both though.

227
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,700
That's your problem.

228
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,300
Unprofessional.

229
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,340
Commercials are not contests.

230
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,860
Charm is more important
than professionalism.

231
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,740
That's why they hire a model to do it.

232
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,940
Time is tight and it's hard to learn.

233
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,420
You must show your worth to the utmost,

234
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,820
which means you have to

235
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,740
make sure every pose
looks perfect in the camera.

236
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,180
Remember.

237
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,140
The spotlight is on the product
in a commercial.

238
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,060
The people in it
are just a tool to highlight it.

239
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,180
So

240
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,020
don't emphasize yourself too much.

241
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,060
Got it.

242
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,140
Thanks, Mo.

243
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,260
Go on then.

244
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,740
Practice.

245
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,220
Straighten up your back.

246
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,860
Open your shoulders.

247
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,660
Arms higher.

248
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,740
Look at yourself in the mirror.

249
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,020
No.

250
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,700
No.

251
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,940
Harder.

252
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,820
Higher.

253
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,500
Stare.

254
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,900
Don't look sideways.

255
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,900
Always remember

256
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,500
to make every move look cool.

257
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,180
Look at this point.

258
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,380
Come on.

259
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,820
Come on.

260
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,500
Mo,

261
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,020
may I ask you something?

262
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Why did you help me?

263
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,940
After all, you...

264
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,340
Because you're a member of the Top Line,

265
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,740
representing ACME.

266
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,220
I used to be in your position.

267
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,420
I was as pushy as you are
when I was a newcomer.

268
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,420
I wanted to prove myself so bad

269
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,580
but chances for me were few.

270
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,860
All those seniors were so competitive.

271
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,140
Finally, I got one.

272
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,140
I wanted it so bad

273
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,500
but in the end,

274
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,460
I was afraid that I might offend others.

275
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,580
I was so frustrated

276
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,540
and got caught up in a dilemma.

277
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,380
You know?

278
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,380
Therefore, you shouldn't overthink it.

279
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,500
Don't pretend to be Mr. Nice
if you want success.

280
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,020
Be determined and run.

281
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,860
When you leave them behind far enough,

282
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,580
you won't be hearing
anything bad from them.

283
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,180
Yeah.

284
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,340
That's why I'm working so hard

285
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,220
and pushing myself to my limit.

286
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,140
I don't want to lose.

287
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,780
Mo,

288
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,740
sorry.

289
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,020
Oh, come on.

290
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,460
Just this once.

291
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,980
I won't say it again.

292
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,940
If you truly feel sorry,

293
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,460
get it done handsomely,

294
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,180
so I won't lose to someone less worthy.

295
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,140
That'll embarrass me more.

296
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,620
You're still here?

297
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,660
I walked by the practice room

298
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,660
and saw a mobile phone there.

299
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,700
I wonder whose phone it is.

300
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,540
It's mine.

301
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,980
No wonder it looks so familiar.

302
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,380
Bye, Mo.

303
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,180
See you tomorrow.

304
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,140
See you.

305
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,380
Oh, right.

306
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,580
How is the boy?

307
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,180
He's okay.

308
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,180
You know what he's like.

309
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,100
He'll bounce back
after letting out his emotions.

310
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,860
OK.

311
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,580
Let him reflect on his doings at home.

312
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,500
When Ms. Ling simmers down,

313
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,620
I'll give him a lesson.

314
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,900
Bye.

315
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,140
See you, Mo.

316
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,140
Ms. Han, did you come to pick me up?

317
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,740
Not exactly.

318
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,980
I happened to be here.

319
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,420
Oh, really?

320
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,380
We were destined to meet then.

321
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,580
Cut it out.

322
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,540
You neither answered my calls

323
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,500
nor texted me back.

324
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,900
You didn't have your motorbike with you.

325
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,980
Are you going to walk back home?

326
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,860
It's more than 20 kilometers.

327
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,780
You won't make it home until dawn.

328
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,780
So you came to pick me up.

329
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,820
I was afraid the time I spent on you
would be wasted.

330
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Seems like Mr. Xing was easy on you.

331
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,500
You still have the strength to tease me.

332
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,580
You know about that as well?

333
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,820
Did he tell you?

334
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,300
Anything that happens in the company

335
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,460
will be known by all in 24 hours,

336
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,740
no matter big or small.

337
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,780
Well, what happened that night...

338
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,620
Jia Fan.

339
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,340
That's between you and me only.

340
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,820
No one else would know.

341
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,740
Sometimes, I can't help thinking

342
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,180
I must be unbelievably lucky

343
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,900
to have met

344
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,660
Ms. Ling, Mo...

345
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,900
and you.

346
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,700
So I have to do my best

347
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,540
to deserve such luck.

348
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,100
Glad that you know.

349
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,020
If you screw up,

350
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,540
I won't let you off.

351
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,900
Yes, ma'am.

355

Fan,

356
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,380
why are you still here?

357
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,700
Where am I supposed to be?

358
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,140
In the studio.

359
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,420
The shooting for Rachel.

360
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
We're here to see how you're doing.

361
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,140
I thought it was 11.

362
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,660
It has been reschedule to 9.

363
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
Ms. Ling and Mr. Wu
should have arrived long ago.

364
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,100
[08:27]

365
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,380
Yijing.

366
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,580
How long will he need?

367
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,820
It's the morning rush hour.

368
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,860
There is a lot of traffic.

369
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,340
Theoretically, 20 minutes is enough.

370
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,980
Who was the one to send the notice?

371
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,660
He had been out of reach last night,

372
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,620
so I called Xing Mo.

373
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,940
They were together then.

374
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,420
Keep rushing him.

375
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,420
I'll keep Mr. Zhang busy.

376
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,500
OK.

377
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,820
Ms. Ling,

378
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I dragged him here.

379
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,340
We didn't get chosen

380
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,140
and that's why we came
to show our support.

381
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,180
Firstly, our presence
represents we don't hold grudges

382
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,300
and that we totally understand
Rachel's decision,

383
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,420
so they'll feel they're respected.

384
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,220
Secondly, we're here to show

385
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
the team spirit of ACME.

386
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,100
We don't compete against each other

387
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,500
and we'll never harm
the strong bond of the team

388
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
for the sake of personal interest.

389
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,460
You surprised me.

390
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,100
Where is Jia Fan?

391
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,340
I don't see him here.

392
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,700
What do you think?

393
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,740
Pretty impressive, huh?

394
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,380
I practiced the speech
for the whole night.

395
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,420
Mr. Zhang.

396
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,620
Mr. Chen.

397
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,620
Thank you for your hard work.

398
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,340
If this goes on,

399
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,620
we won't make it.

400
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,700
Is there an accident ahead of us?

401
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,940
This is Landong Road, right?

402
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,060
Why?

403
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,580
You're not going?

404
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,540
Drive safe.

405
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,180
Don't come with me.

406
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,020
Here comes the coffee.

407
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,860
Mr. Zhang.

408
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,260
Yes.

409
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
Your latte, no sugar.

410
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,300
Thank you.

411
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,860
Here you are, Mr. Chen.

412
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,660
Mr. Chen.

413
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,620
Thank you.

414
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,860
Where is the model?

415
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,100
All ready?

416
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,180
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,260
There are some details

418
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,540
about the filming script

419
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,300
that I'd like

420
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,540
to confirm with you.

421
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:41,940
OK.

422
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,620
May I?

423
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,460
Sure.

424
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,660
Don't come out of the car.

425
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,020
I'll just wait here by myself.

426
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,580
You focus on the drive.

427
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,500
Maybe the cars will start moving later.

428
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Why not wait inside the car?

429
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,300
It's alright.

430
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,420
She'll be here soon, I bet.

431
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,340
Make way, please.

432
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
Is she here?

433
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,260
Yes.

434
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,860
Xiaoru.

435
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,980
Fan.

436
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,740
This way.

437
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,460
Our model takes this commercial

438
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,380
so seriously

439
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,100
and trained for it for a long time.

440
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,780
Pick up.

441
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,980
Pick up!

442
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,140
He took lessons in skateboarding.

443
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,060
I went out to wander about

444
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,220
but no sight of him at all.

445
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,340
He's late for the first shooting.

446
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,340
He's so doomed.

447
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,060
[One kilometer to Qingyang Road]

448
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,900
Ming, please stall them.

449
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,740
He'll be there soon.

450
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,900
This close-up of his,

451
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,740
this shot,

452
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,060
is pretty good.

453
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,860
Ms. Ling,

454
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,220
don't keep stalling me.

455
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,220
Just tell me

456
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,300
when can he show his face?

457
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,820
Right away.

458
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
I've done commercials for many stars

459
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,420
but I've never met anyone

460
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
putting on airs to such an extent.

461
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Ms. Ling, have you got a minute?

462
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,060
Where is he?

463
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,660
He didn't pick up.

464
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,700
Mr. Chen.

465
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,620
Mr. Chen.

466
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,460
Wait, Mr. Zhang.

467
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,380
Mr. Zhang, what is it?

468
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,180
What's going on here?

469
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,220
Are we shooting it or not?

470
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,340
Easy, easy, alright?

471
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,380
What's going on?

472
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,900
Are we just going to wait
until he shows up?

473
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,540
One moment, please.

474
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,540
I'll take care of it.

475
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,060
Ms. Ling,

476
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,260
what's going on?

477
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
He's on his way.

478
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,580
Ten minutes, top.

479
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,140
What if he can't make it?

480
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,460
Do you have a plan B?

481
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,980
Yes.

482
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,380
What were you thinking?

483
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
Are you doing this or not?

484
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,460
I...

485
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,140
Just go.

486
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,620
Sorry, Ms. Ling.

487
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,260
I'm late.

488
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,900
Why are you late?

489
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,300
Something happened on the way here.

490
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,340
Go tell Mr. Zhang.

491
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,420
He's waited for a long time.

492
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,100
Hurry.

493
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,980
He didn't mean it.

494
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
I have a plan B

495
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,700
but I'm afraid he isn't as well-prepared

496
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,500
which might slow the process down.

497
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,660
Never mind.

498
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,980
I should have waited for you

499
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,100
for one more hour.

500
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,940
Sorry, it's my fault.

501
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
The spotlight
is on you after all, right?

502
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:50,780
No.

503
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,020
It's all my fault.

504
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,900
So you did it on purpose?

505
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,700
You're so young
and you're so good at putting on airs.

506
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,500
I didn't mean it.

507
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,180
Mr. Zhang. I didn't.

508
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,900
I told the whole crew

509
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,420
to stand by early in the morning.

510
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,260
Yeah.

511
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,700
But it turns out?

512
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,380
All these people

513
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,300
waited for you for more than 30 minutes.

514
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,620
What if we can't finish it on time

515
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,180
or the quality is compromised?

516
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,740
Who will be responsible for it?

517
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,940
This is all my fault.

518
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,260
Mr. Zhang.

519
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,220
Well,

520
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,220
shall we get started?

521
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,420
We only have nine hours

522
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,940
before you leave for the flight.

523
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,740
We won't make it

524
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,020
if we don't start now.

525
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,660
Mr. Zhang.

526
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,980
Please start shooting now

527
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,100
and I'll find another model.

528
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,260
If you think he isn't good enough,

529
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,980
I'll have him replaced.

530
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,820
OK.

531
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,860
I'm doing this

532
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,060
for the sake of you two.

533
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,580
Thank you.

534
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,420
Come on,

535
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,260
all departments.

536
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,180
Let's get started.

537
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,140
Come on.

538
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,420
Go for it.

539
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,220
Come on.

540
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,260
Time is ticking.

541
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,500
Hey.

542
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,900
He's about to shoot.

543
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,500
Don't disturb him. Thank you.

544
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,100
What do you mean?

545
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,420
I have asked the marketing team.

546
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,860
They called Jia Fan
as soon as they knew

547
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,100
the shooting had been rescheduled.

548
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,740
He didn't answer his phone

549
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,020
so they contacted you

550
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,700
because you were with him.

551
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,580
They asked you to tell him that.

552
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,060
You agreed

553
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,980
and you told them
he didn't want the pickup service

554
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,260
and he'd hail a cab instead.

555
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,580
Oh?

556
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Now I see.

557
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,100
This is no surprise.

558
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,540
I'll take back

559
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,780
what you take away from me.

560
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,460
Yes.

561
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,540
This was supposed to be my job anyway.

562
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,460
Why did you spend time
teaching him then?

563
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,980
Earn yourself a good reputation?

564
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
Surprise.

565
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,100
You don't know me well enough.

566
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,820
We've known each other for 10 years.

567
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,460
He trusted you.

568
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,660
Don't move.

569
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,260
Let me.

570
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,940
No.

571
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,860
I can do this myself.

572
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,780
I can't let you.

573
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,820
This is my job.

574
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,260
Are you shy?

575
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,740
I'm immune to men's bodies.

576
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,020
No.

577
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,660
It's OK.

578
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,860
This is my first time.

579
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm not used to it yet.

580
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,980
Give it to me.

581
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,820
I can do this myself.

582
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,660
Please, please, please.

583
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,940
Yijing.

584
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,180
Why hasn't he changed?

585
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,220
He wouldn't let me.
He wanted to do this himself.

586
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,140
It's okay. I'll handle it.

587
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,020
Thanks.

588
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,180
Who is the guy?

589
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,620
Even Yijing is helping him.

590
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,700
What now?

591
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,220
Nothing.

592
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,500
Don't lie.

593
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,780
You're never shy.

594
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,060
Why didn't you get changed?

595
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,220
Well,

596
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,020
I can't take off my clothes here...

597
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,740
Take them off.

598
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,940
Ms. Han.

599
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,740
Cut it out.

600
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,540
Quickly.

601
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,700
Ah.

602
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,900
Why is your hoodie torn?

603
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,820
Did you fall again?

604
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,540
I'm fine.

605
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,500
It won't affect me.

606
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,620
Is your shoulder...?

607
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,620
Forget about the shoot.

608
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,900
Go to the hospital now.

609
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,980
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt anyway.

610
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,940
I can take it.

611
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Moreover,

612
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,780
my legs are totally fine.

613
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,220
The shoot won't be affected.

614
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,780
Don't worry.

615
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,620
I'm worried about you.

616
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,620
Don't play tough, OK?

617
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,740
You're playing tough as well.

618
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,460
Regardless of the pain,

619
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,220
you never give up

620
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,500
and everyone is fooled by your acting.

621
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,180
I can do it, too.

622
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,180
I'll learn from you.

623
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,300
You're my teacher.

624
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,540
It took me so long to come this far.

625
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,460
I don't want this chance to slip away.

626
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:47,980
How about this?

627
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,780
You can watch me through the monitor.

628
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,380
As soon as you say cut,

629
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,780
I'll stop.

630
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,940
OK?

631
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,060
Nice.

632
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,100
Good.

633
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,700
One more take.

634
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,860
Your moves should be bigger
and more powerful,

635
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,060
and your expression

636
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,060
more cheerful.

637
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,460
What's going on?

638
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,340
Once again.

639
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,060
Do it again.

640
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,060
Get ready.

641
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,060
You're up.

642
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,540
What do you mean?

643
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,740
Look at him.

644
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,220
He can't do this any longer.

645
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
It's normal to make a few mistakes.

646
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,340
He's hurt.

647
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,580
His left shoulder

648
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,620
is not right.

649
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,060
Cut.

650
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,460
You're making too many mistakes.

651
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,180
Are you losing your strength already?

652
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,380
I wanted a real predator,

653
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,500
not this little house pet.

654
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,140
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

655
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,580
Let's do this again.

656
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,300
Cheer up.

657
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,900
Don't waste our time.

658
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,300
Can you do this or not?

659
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,860
Mr. Zhang.

660
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,060
Excuse me.

661
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,180
Can we take ten?

662
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,460
We can help him bounce back.

663
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,660
