00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,900
Fan!

3
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,020
Fan, are you up?

4
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,660
Hurry up.

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,500
Don't be dramatic.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,740
He's tidying himself up.

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,620
You've got a big voice.

8
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,860
That's right.

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,820
He should tidy himself up.

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,620
It's his big day of returning.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,300
He must make his entrance

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,740
and impress everybody.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,020
Do you hear?

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,380
There you are.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,300
He'll impress everybody.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,140
Are you done?

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,860
Yes.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:01,940
That's it?

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,740
Any problem?

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,500
I look simple but handsome.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,220
Uncle Jia, look at him.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,140
Come on.

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:11,900
What for?

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,220
Just go.

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,620
I'll give you a new look.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,500
No need.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,060
I don't want you to embarrass me.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,580
Why...?

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,060
I'm not only your agent

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,700
but also your stylist.

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,940
I won't embarrass you.

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,700
You need a better look.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,260
Ms. Ling,

34
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,900
why don't you sleep in your office?

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,180
The car's air is bad.

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,980
Be careful.

37
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,220
You're late.

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,420
I'm cutting it fine.

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,340
Five more minutes.

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,100
Yeah.

41
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,780
But you can't reach
the practice room within that.

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,020
Better be prepared.

43
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,140
I guess you need extra practice recently

44
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,420
to make up for missed learning.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,100
Okay.

46
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,700
No problem.

47
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,340
Quite a lot of offers for you.

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
But don't be proud.

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,700
Your schedule
is completely full this month.

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,100
So, you'll be either taking auditions

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,260
or going for them.

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,300
No time for anything else.

53
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,580
No problem.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,020
I'll do anything you say.

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,300
And again, let me say this.

56
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,780
Getting you back doesn't mean I approve.

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,820
I don't care what you do in private.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,660
But in the company, keep your distance.

59
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,420
If I hear anyone gossip...

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,220
Don't worry, Ms. Ling.

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,980
I know what to do.

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,820
Ms. Ling.

63
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,500
I know.

64
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,380
For whatever reason,

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,740
you must have got me back

66
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,420
under a lot of pressure.

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,540
So, I will fight for your honor.

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,740
Now, I'm back in ACME.

69
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,500
At least it shows

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,900
something can be changed

71
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,460
as long as I try hard enough.

72
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,460
So?

73
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,620
So, I want to try.

74
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,100
I don't want to give up.

75
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,540

Look who's here.

79
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,660
So good.

80
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,060
Compared to past team members,

81
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,420
they seem to have a stronger bond.

82
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,260
And they're definitely the goofiest.

83
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,460
One more friend

84
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,620
means one more competitor.

85
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
Don't overthink it.

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,100
Just let them savor the moment.

87
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,420
Whatever happens, we'll deal with it.

88
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,220
This is what young guys do.

89
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,580
I hope they'll never change.

90

Mr. Wu,

91
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,340
they can be young and innocent,

92
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,140
but you can't.

93
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,500
Right.

94
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,460
I'm no longer young.

95
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,180
Since he's back,

96
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,500
give him jobs.

97

Okay.

Ms. Ling.

108
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,180
You're awake.

109
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,140
That's great. Glad you're fine.

110
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,140
According to the doctor,
you've been exhausted

111
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,660
and didn't get enough sleep.

112
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,500
You had low blood sugar.

113
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,180
So, you...

114
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,660
I'm fine, right?

115
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,380
Then...

116
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,140
Don't do that.

117
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,220
Lie back down.

118
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,620
Some checkup results haven't come out.

119
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,340
Because of Jia Fan, right?

120
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,620
When he came back,

121
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,660
a lot of trouble followed.

122
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,220
You were so stressed

123
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,980
that you fainted.

124
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,220

Fine. I'll go.

129
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,540
Okay?

130
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,460
Leave everything to me.

131
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,620
You just stay here and get well.

132
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,740
You better hurry.

133
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,140
Panio is also there. Don't be late.

Wait a minute.

You'll go later. It's okay.

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,300
Why?

141
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,540
I have

142
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,900
an emergency

143
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,460
that is really urgent.

144
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,220
I can't remember right now.

145
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,580
You...

You sit there and wait.

Call me when you think of it.

There you go, Ming.

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,820
I'll be here.

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,780
Fine.

00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Yijing is also here.

She's worried.

154
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,260
She's talking to the doctor
about the medical reports.

155
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,420
She'll be back soon.

156
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,860
You should have told me.

157
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,940
Hurry.

158
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
Don't be late.

How are you?

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,260
What did the doctor say?

161
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
When can you leave the hospital?

162
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,500
Not until the results come out.

163
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,300
Ask the doctor or Yijing for details.

164
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,980
Anyway,

165
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,420
you won't believe what I say.

166
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,420
It's possibly because
I didn't get enough sleep.

167
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,060
So, now,

168
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,580
I'll get some sleep.

169
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,060
You can leave.

170
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,380
Okay.

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,060
Get some sleep.

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,980
Don't mind me.

She looks well.

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,340
I'll go see her.

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,140
Call me if necessary.

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,100
Oh, Xing Mo is here.

179
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,820
In her ward.

180
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,060
Why?

181
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,740
Won't you get in?

182
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
She's waiting for you.

183
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,340
I had a stitch when walking back.

184
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,220
I'll take a break.

185
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,220
You should go.

186
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,460
I'll leave, then.

187
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,220
Hey.

188
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,340
Hey.

Mm.

That's good.

195
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,820
I'll try on a dozen suits today.

196
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,620
If everything goes smoothly,

197
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,700
I'll finish at nine.

198
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,460
It will go smoothly.

199
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,460
Focus on your work.

200
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,940
I'll be busy for a month.

201
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,060
That's good.

202
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,900
Remember to have regular meals.

203
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,780
I want to see you.

204
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,660
How about we meet tonight?

205
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,540
I'll tell you something.

206
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,620
I'll tell you something too.

207
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,980
When I finish, okay?

208
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,660
Mm.

209
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,740
You pick the time

210
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,660
while I pick the place.

211
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,780
Mr. Jia.

212
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,180
Mr. Jia.

213
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,140
I'll hang up.

214
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,980
Bye-bye.

215
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,060
Get changed.

216
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,500
Panio is outside the door.

217
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,060
Mr. Wu is on his way, too.

218
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,700
Let's go.

219
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,540
Okay. Come on.

220
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,740
It's now or never.

221
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,140
How is she?

222
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,140
Is everything okay?

223
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,660
I think so.

224
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,380
Go back.

225
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,620
She won't wake up until you leave.

226
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,900
That's why I have to be here.

227
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
She must stay for at least 12 hours.

228
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,140
You're really something.

229
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,620
If it were someone else,

230
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,340
he would have given up.

231
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
Within a month.

232
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,220
Aren't you doing the same?

233
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,940
Someone else wouldn't
have caused so much trouble.

234
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,420
I kind of understand her now.

235
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,020
All alone, she brought me up.

236
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
And she started a business...

237
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,860
and handled such a big company.

238
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,660
She had to take care of everything,

239
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,180
big or small.

240
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,100
Now, she's asked to let it go.

241
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,740
Nobody would accept it.

242
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,820
Sadly, she's asleep...

243
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,180
and can't hear you.

244
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm saying this to you.

245
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,580
You want an authoritative boss

246
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,940
to be your friend?

247
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,860
It's hard.

248
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,420
Girlfriend?

249
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,740
Even harder.

250
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,660
So don't be impatient.

251
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,780
Give her some time.

252
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,180
It's been only six years.

253
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,940
I will succeed.

254
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,260
Don't expect me to call you Uncle.

255
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Don't even think about it.

256
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,860
Hello.

257
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,620
Okay.

258
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,180
I get it.

259
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,980
I'll see you later.

260
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,180
Where are you going?

261
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,100
I have to go out

262
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,820
for an emergency.

263
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,140
What's the emergency?

264
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,820
The doctor said

265
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,260
you must not leave
before the results come out.

266
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,780
I know I'm fit enough.

267
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,260
Let me drive you.

268
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,980
No need.

269
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,140
You didn't drive here.

270
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,460
And you are...

271
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,380
I can take a taxi.

272
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,060
Don't be so stubborn, okay?

273
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,380
I'll drive you there and leave.

274
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,140
I won't interfere, okay?

275
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,220
Your existence is interfering.

276
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,700
Stop bothering me, will you?

277
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,060
Let me say this one last time.

278
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,340
Please stay away from me.

279
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
You're in no position to interfere.

280
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
I take back what I just said.

281
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,260
Find someone else to love.

282
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,180
She isn't worth it.

Ms. Li.

289
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,020
Oh no.

290
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,940
I should call you Principal Li.

291
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,100
Long time no see, Jialing.

292
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,780
Why do you look so pale?

293
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,740
Feeling unwell?

294
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:38,580
No.

295
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,180
I just ran all the way here

296
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,820
to see you.

297
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,940
Don't worry.

298
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,500
After we talked on the phone,

299
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,980
I asked around immediately.

300
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,860
I questioned everyone

301
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,300
whether they were around.

302
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,980
Nobody knew about it.

303
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,580
Nobody saw that guy, either.

304
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,980
Glad to know that.

305
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,340
Besides,

306
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I told everybody.

307
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,900
If somebody asks about her again,

308
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,780
they won't reply.

309
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,820
They'll just say
they don't know anything.

310
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,460
Thank you, Principal Li.

311
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,940
Don't say that.

312
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,780
Life is so hard for her.

313
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,580
I really feel happy for her

314
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,340
when she's so successful.

315
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,820
But I've been confused

316
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,620
about one thing.

317
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,140
Even if people know about this,

318
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,380
she won't be hurt, I think.

319
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,020
It's not her fault, anyway.

320
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,100
And it has nothing to do
with her performance.

321
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,620
Yeah.

322
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,420
If her story

323
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,580
is reported,

324
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,100
she may even have a better career.

325
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,540
So,

326
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,900
don't be so nervous.

327
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,900
But it will kill her.

328
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,180
Compared to her career,

329
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,500
her life matters more.

330
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,380
Call her again and ask.

331
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,700
I don't need to.

332
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,580
She isn't working

333
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,300
and doesn't answer the phone.

334
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,420
She must be dating.

335
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,300
So, I told you to ask her.

336
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,220
What is wrong with me?

337
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,620
They are having a romantic moment.

338
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,260
Ms. Ling.

339
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,820
Ms...

340
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,500
Ms. Ling.

341
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,140
Where's Yijing?

342
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,580
In the beauty salon.

343
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,940
Maybe she's asleep.

344
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,380
She didn't answer the call.

345
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,780
Stay with her wherever she goes.

346
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,100
Don't let her go alone.

347
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,060
What does Ms. Ling mean?

348
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,380
Yijing can't date, huh?

349
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,740
She finally got Fan back after

350
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,540
but didn't approve.

351
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,300
What a waste of time, right?

352
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,740
I'm just talking to myself.

353
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,460
Don't ask her.

354
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,140
Ms. Ling.

355
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,740
Ms. Ling.

356
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:39,980
Sorry.

357
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,140
Just a few minutes, please.

358
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,380
I have to tell you something.

359
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,260
Go ahead.

360
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,340
Ms. Ling,

361
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,900
I know you don't approve
of Yijing and Jia Fan.

362
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,260
At first, I didn't support them, either.

363
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,540
I thought Yijing deserved a better man.

364
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,580
But when Jia Fan left ACME,

365
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,780
I realized

366
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,620
we underestimated his love for Yijing.

367
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,580
Most importantly,

368
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,420
Yijing hasn't been so happy for a while.

369
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,340
I want her to be always happy.

370
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,020
So I changed my mind.

371
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,820
I support them now.

372
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,820
They're the perfect couple in my eyes.

373
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,900
They never leave each other
under any circumstances.

374
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,420
They work hard and improve themselves.

375
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,340
They're friends,

376
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,220
families,

377
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,340
and even comrades.

378
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,620
Are you done?

379
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,620
But the happier, the more dangerous.

380
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,740
Especially Yijing.

381
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,700
What do you mean?

382
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,700
Huang Jinde is targeting her.

383
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,900
And Jia Fan,
Liao Jinyuan, and You Ning...

384
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,820
He said he'd figure out their stories

385
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,580
and make a dramatic scene

386
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,460
to ruin her reputation.

387
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,580
He even said...

388
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,620
Who told you that?

389
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,060
Huang Jinde?

390
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,580
Yes.

391
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
He said that personally.

392
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,940
I heard him myself.

393
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,980
Ms. Ling,

394
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,420
I told you this

395
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,700
so that you could get prepared

396
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,620
if Huang Jinde came someday.

397
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,460
You could also do something

398
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,300
to help these guys.

399
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,620
Love isn't a shame.

400
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,940
No one should hold it against them

401
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,780
or dig up dirt on them.

402
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,020
But true love

403
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,180
can survive the skepticism

404
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,340
and the ordeal.

405
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,700
What will be, will be.

406
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,140
Don't worry.

407
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,060
They'll handle it.

408
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,420
What does she mean?

409
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,220
She approved.

410
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,460
I...

411
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,620
persuaded her.

412
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,420
Hey.

413
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,060
You finally answered the phone.

414
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,900
Where are you?

415
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,500
Is Yijing with you?

416
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,660
Yes.

417
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,020
That's fine.

418
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,420
Be safe.

419
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,300
Stay somewhere private.

420
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,780
Huang Jinde has his eyes on you.

421
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,140
Okay. I get it.

422
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,580
You still have makeup on?

423
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,580
What if...?

424
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,140
So you rushed here to see me.

425
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,060
I didn't know you could dance.

426
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,300
Gorgeous.

427
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,420
How naive.

428
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,380
I used to dance better.

429
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,020
Do you know why I invited you over here?

430
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,820
Because of Huang Jinde?

431
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,500
Did he talk to you again?

432
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,940
Not at all.

433
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,940
You asked me to treat him like dirt.

434
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,740
Because this is
where your dream started.

435
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,780
It's also where you had
your first runway practice

436
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,460
and the first training.

437
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,900
Yes.

438
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,580
You also helped me
for the first time here.

439
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,380
Without your help,

440
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I wouldn't have come this far.

441
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,340
So pay me back

442
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,740
with the rest of your life.

443
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,100
What's wrong?

444
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,140
You don't want it?

445
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,220
Yijing.

446
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,060
I've been wondering

447
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,220
if I'll tell you something.

448
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
I think I should.

449
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,340
I...

450
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,740
I won't make it next year.

451
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,860
At the end of this year,

452
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,780
my model life will be over.

453
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,220
You should be happy for me.

454
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,020
It should have happened three years ago.

455
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,380
I earned an extra year.

456
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,740
I'll finally follow the doctor's advice.

457
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,740
I won't challenge myself anymore.

458
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,500
Is it settled?

459
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
How about another doctor?

460
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,420
You didn't earn this extra year.

461
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,460
You risked your life for it.

462
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,300
I can't feel happy.

463
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,180
Sorry.

464
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,580
If I'm no longer a supermodel,

465
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,780
will you still love me?

466
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,180
Yes.

467
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,580
What if I have permanent problems

468
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,180
and can't work anymore?

469
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,100
I'll raise you.

470
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,700
What if I can't take care of myself?

471
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,060
I'm here for you.

472
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Don't be afraid of anything.

473
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,060
If you were in this situation,

474
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,820
I'd do the same.

475
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,740
Whatever you suffer,

476
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,220
I will love you

477

When I'm around,

479
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,060
you'll never be scared.

480
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,540
Indeed,

481
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,140
I risked my life for this year.

482
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,900
It's a short period.

483
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,740
But luckily, I met you.

484
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,860
So, I'm happy enough.

485
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,780
I have no regrets.

486
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,580
The only thing you should do for me

487
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,100
is keep working.

488
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,900
Work hard as you do now

489
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,500

Today, I got you here.

I hope you won't forget your resolution

492
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,980
or what you said to me.

493
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,900
No one can ask you to give up

494
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,380
and no one

495
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,460
can deprive you of having a dream.
