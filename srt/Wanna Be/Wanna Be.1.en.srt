1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,160
The first impression

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,590
models give is that they're tall,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,400
have great poise,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,830
and look good in anything.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,480
Basically,

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,670
they're born to wear anything.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,880
Born with it.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,070
Not much skill required.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
I agree.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,670
Being a model is more of an identity

11
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,510
than a profession.

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,030
At best, it's a side job.

13
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,000
The fashion industry, you know.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Just take a few more photos
and you're done.

15
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,440
If I were tall, I'd be a model too.

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,440
There are plenty of jobs
for tall people.

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,000
Why choose modeling?

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,670
Always being judged,

19
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,920
wearing barely anything,

20
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,600
and having strangers point and stare.

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,750
And, it feels

22
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,200
so disconnected from our everyday lives.

23
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
Totally unrelated.

24
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,200
So, I think

25
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,110
being an actor is more meaningful
than being a model.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Ignorant.

27
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,430
Where did they find the audience?

28
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,560

Hello, everyone.

44

Hi, ma'am.

45
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,040
Hi, Yijing.

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,950
It's really been a while.

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
It's been over three years, right?

48
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,040
These past three years

49
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
must have been tough for you.

50
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,280
You've been through a lot, haven't you?

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,590
Seeing you make

52
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,950
such a strong comeback,

53
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,350
I'm really happy for you.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,640
Thank you.

55
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,200
For a long time,

56
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,950
people outside the industry

57
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,510
have had certain biases

58
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,350
and stereotypes about modeling.

59
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,040
That's why

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,120
we invited you to our show today

61
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,680
to give modeling a voice

62
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,920
and set the record straight.

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,310
Is that in the outline?

64
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Doesn't matter.

65
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
Just don't bring up those three years.

66
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,310
I remember you debuted at 19, right?

67
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,150
Yes.

68
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,000
It was around the summer of 19.

69
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,870
That's impressive.

70
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,310
From 19 to 24,

71
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,840
in just five years,

72
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,150
you became a regular

73
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,590
at the four major
international fashion weeks.

74
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,680
Well, that's just how it is.

75
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,120
A model's career span is short.

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,280
So,

77
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,960
if only that car accident
hadn't happened.

78
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,120
Then you wouldn't have
wasted three years.

79
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,520
You're here anyway.

80
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,750
Why not tell the whole story?

81
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,520
I remember there were reports

82
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
about you everywhere

83
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,680
for almost a month.

84
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,560
That night, around 11 PM,

85
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,750
you were in a car accident.

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
Although you survived,

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,710
the doctors said

88
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,150
it could have left you
permanently disabled.

89
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,910
But against all odds,

90
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,400
in just three years,

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,150
you're back on the runway,

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,870
and even voted as the best role model
by college students.

94
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,560
Both your personal fame
and commercial value

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
far surpassed what they were before.

96
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,310
Would you say this was a blessing
in disguise?

97
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
Why not?

98
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,680
It's said

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
that you were invited

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,520
to an appreciation dinner
for a catering brand

101
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,190
but you didn't go.

102
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,710
Instead, you were

103
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,840
on the highway to the airport.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,710
It must have been something important.

105

What do you think?

106
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,080
I don't think it was for business.

107
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,710
I remember

108
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,710
you were alone in the car.

109
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,080
After my comeback,

110
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,870
I never wanted to do shows.

111
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,280
Turns out I still made the wrong choice.

113
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,150
being a very positive show.

114
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Since when did it become so interested

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,030

116
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,960

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,590
No.

118
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,240
Then is it for ratings?

119
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Of course not.

120
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,750
To be precise, it's for you.

Rather than letting rumors
spiral out of control,

122
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,510
why not make a public statement yourself

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
to put an end to it?

124
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,040
Makes sense.

125
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,360
Well then…

126
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,040
How about you take this opportunity

127
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,190

Prejudice comes

191
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,600
Once you're there,
you'll start training.

192
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,390
With your talent,

193
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,600
it'll take you at most four years.

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,670
Once you pass the assessment,

195
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,200
you'll become the youngest

196
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
and most skilled head chef in our group.

197
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
How many four-year chunks do we have?

198
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,390
You'll make me miss out
on a lot of money.

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
You're shortsighted and ungrateful.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
Ms. Qu, thanks for your appreciation.

201
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,320
Just come by more often.

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,150
I'll give you a discount.

203
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,320
Hey, you...

204
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,240
How could you...?

205
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,600
Man, I need your help urgently.

206
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,080
Quick!

207
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,600
I sent you an address.

208
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,660
Go to my place, pick up a package,

209
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,180
and get it here as fast as you can.

210
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,660
No time.

211
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,660
Stop messing around, hurry!

212
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,500
If it weren't for my dad
opening a new store in Marseille,

213
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,100
you wouldn't have this chance.

214
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,900
Who is it?

215
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,300
Qu Ruoqing again?

216
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,700
Miss this, and you'll never
get another chance.

217
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
I'm begging you.

218
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,340
If I don't get it in half an hour,
I'm dead meat.

219
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,860
Listen,

220
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,740
you'll get paid during the training.

221
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,460
Two hundred.

222
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,100
Room and board are covered,
and travel expenses too.

223
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,980
Three hundred.

224
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,940
What are you hesitating for?

225
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,540
Hey, are you done?

226
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,380
Just think about it.

227
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,860
Five hundred.

228
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,460
Deal.

229
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,180
Really?

230
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,940
Payment on delivery.

231
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,740
Full amount.

232
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,660

233
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,500
Get this inside fast.

234
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,900
The audience will be here soon.

235
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,740
This board, hurry.

236
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,900

How's the dressing room situation?

238
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,060
Everyone's here, right?

239
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,980
Yijing, I didn't expect to be
on the same stage with you so soon.

240
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,580
How was yesterday's recording?

241
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,460
When will it air?

242
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,100
Where is the band-aid?

243
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,980
Don't forget next time.

244
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,740
Still slouching?

245
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,540
You need to look presentable on stage.

246
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,460
Or there won't be a next time.

247
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,060
Yes, I'll pay attention.

248
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,300
Yijing,

249
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,580
you could be a bit friendlier.

250
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,980
You haven't been around for three years.

251
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
Am I not friendly?

252
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,340
I mean, you could smile more.

253
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,540
Girls who smile have better luck

254
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
and are more likable.

255

257
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,060
I heard she's been acting crazy
since she got here.

258
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,300
Already made a few people cry.

259
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,780

Can't even do

263
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,780
a simple task like changing a hat.

264
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,340
Sorry.

265
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,420
I didn't expect the delivery
to be so slow.

266
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,580
Are you trying to sabotage me?

267
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,700
The show is about to start.

268
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,940
How am I supposed to go on stage?

269
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,820
I've already called to hurry them up.

270

Well, just five more minutes.

271
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,540
No.

272

Three.

273
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,620
Three minutes.

274
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,860
What if it's not here in three minutes?

275
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,900
Then…

276
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,780
Then I'll…

277

278

Uh, sorry about that.

How did you get in here?

283
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,500
I called you, but you didn't answer,

284
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,740
so I had to talk to security.

285
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
I've been waiting for you forever.

286
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,940

You're the delivery guy?

Well…

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,580
Actually, the tailor shop
is next to the seafood shop.

295
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,460
He's a runner.

296

Always going back and forth
between the two.

You're all in the same industry.

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,540
If Ms. Ling finds out,

378
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,780
no one can protect you!

379
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,300
It doesn't matter
if you did it on purpose.

380
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
After all, the main piece
you've been longing for

381
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,140
is on me.

382
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,820
And I'm opening the show.

383
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,300
Han Yijing, you're going too far!

384
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,700
You...

385
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,460
Let go of me!

386
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,020
Let go!

387
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,740
Alright.

388
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,420
Stop arguing.

389
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,220
Don't stop me.

390
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,780
What are you doing?

391
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,820
Stop talking.

392
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,300
It's... It's smoking.

393
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,340
Fire!

394
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,380
Get the clothes away.

395
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,060
Hurry, put out the fire.

396
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,540
Over there.

397
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,340
It's okay.

398
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,820
Move!

399
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,380
Everyone, move!

400
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,540
Hurry!

401
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,740
Move!

402
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,340
No!

403
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,580
Don't!

404
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Be careful with the clothes.

405
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,900
The fire is...

406
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,420
out.

407
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,460
Bear with it.

408
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,100
My foot!

409
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Where's An?

410
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,300
It seems he fainted.

411
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,060
It hurts.

412
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,300
Will the show be canceled?

413
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,420
No idea.

414
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
A model hurt her foot.

415
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,860
The designer fainted.

416
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,940
And the show director has gone mad.

417
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,940
What a bummer.

418
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,900
If they want to make a scene, let them.

419
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Why drag us into it?

420
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,500
Exactly.

421
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,060
Don't worry.

422
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,300
The clothes are still here.

423
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,260
Missing one person
shouldn't be a big deal.

424
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,820
There was a fire.

425
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,020
Of course, we had to use
the fire extinguisher.

426
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,100
But that

427
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,540
ruined all the clothes.

428
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,180
Which is more important,
the clothes or the people?

429
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,300
Alright.

430
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,780
It's hard to explain to an outsider.

431
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,660
That's right.

432
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,380
Ignorance is bliss.

433
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,060
You should have left
after delivering the stuff.

434
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,580
You shouldn't have stood up for me.

435
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,820
But you were being bullied so badly.

436
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,820
I could've just endured it.

437
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm done talking.

438
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,340
I'll take responsibility.

439
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,780
I'm going back to work.

440
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,620
Do you still need help?

441
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,300
Yes.

442
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,420
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang.

443
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,740
It's all my fault.

444
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,180
Are you a model?

445
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,860
No.

446
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,780
Not at all.

447
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,020
Ever been on the runway?

448
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,860
No.

449
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,420
Lift your shirt so I can see.

450
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,620
What are you doing?

451
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,220
Come with me.

452
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,900
Why?

453
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,860
No!

454
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,740
Yijing, this is too sudden,

455
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,820
and it's peak time.

456
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,660
I... I really can't find anyone else.

457
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,100
You can't just

458
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,660
grab a random guy.

459
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,180
Look,

460
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,060
his height, arm length, and measurements

461
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,260
are almost the same as Ding Chen's.

462
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,100
His look...

463
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,300
Doesn't An

464
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,860
like this kind of

465
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,380
scruffy, dull,

466
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,180
and dazed vibe?

467
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,900
Yes, the sharp ones are not our choice.

468
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,660
But you can't just grab

469
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,060
a total rookie with no experience.

470
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,860
Han Yijing.

471
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,380
Calm down, come on.

472
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,660
No.

473
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,460
I'm right here.

474
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,020
You two are calling me scruffy

475
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,820
and dull.

476
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,700
Are you models so great?

477
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,660
You think your taste is so superior?

478
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,900
Let me tell you,

479
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,780
I'm a star at my market.

480
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,620
I have tons of fans.

481
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,180
Besides,

482
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,660
I may not have done it,
but I've seen it.

483
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,780
Isn't it just a runway show?

484
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,900
Wear some weird clothes,

485
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,980
walk up there,

486
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,540
stop, strike some poses,

487
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,420
then walk off. That's it, right?

488
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,780
Oh, and

489
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,460
when you smile, don't move your eyes.

490
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Raise your eyebrow,

491
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,620
but don't actually smile.

492
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,820
That's how you get the supermodel face.

493
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,900
It's all online.

494
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,500
Easy.

495
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,260
Anyone can do it.

496
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,060
Is that how it is?

497
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,700
Exactly.

498
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,540
Shubo,

499
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,100
get this guy on stage
as fast as possible.

500
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,020
What?

501
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,260
Tell the stylist

502
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,500
that his makeup and hair
need to be plain.

503
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
The more unremarkable, the better.

504
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,540
Hold on.

505
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,140
Did I say I'm going on stage?

506
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,380
Didn't you say it was easy?

507
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,620
Then do what you just said.

508
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,060
Walk lazily

509
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,140
with your supermodel face.

510
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,940
Why should I listen to you?

511
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,380
Because you got me into this mess,

512
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,660
caused Ding Chen to hurt his foot,

513
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,140
and almost ruined the entire show.

514
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
You made such a big mess,

515
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,780
and now you want to walk away

516
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,700
without taking any responsibility?

517
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,340
Will you be reasonable?

518
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,860
Does this have anything to do with me?

519
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,100
If you don't do it,

520
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,420
or don't do it well,

521
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,180
there's nothing I can do.

522
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,660
But your friend...

523
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,300
Or girlfriend.

524
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,460
Alright, hurry and get ready.

525
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Remember to spray on some perfume.

526
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,260
Come on, you're great.

527
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,940
I'll go talk to her again.

528
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,940
Yijing.

529
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,860
Don't be nervous.

530
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,460
It's just a few minutes.

531
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,100
What are you doing?

532
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,060
Let's just leave.

533
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,940
Before anyone notices.

534
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,700
What are you doing?

535
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,460
Why did you stop?

536
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,380
Keep going.

537
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,300
Sit down.

538
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,060
You, go away.

539
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,420
Sit.

540
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,820
Here, watch carefully.

541
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,780
Watch it.

542
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,500
From the start to the end of the stage,

543
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,020
the designated spot,

544
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,660
it's 25 steps.

545
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
Got it?

546
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,220
Pause for a few seconds, strike a pose,

547
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,740
then

548
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,100
walk back the same way.

549
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,820
You'll understand once you're done
with styling.

550
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,860
Just remember,

551
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,780
you have to be confident,

552
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,020
fully confident.

553
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,380
Like you're stepping on the whole world.

554
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,860
And ignore everyone.

555
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,580
Being arrogant?

556
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,220
Yes, arrogant.

557
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,020
That's the feeling.

558
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,700
Let me tell you,

559
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,820
I have experience.

560
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,260
A few years ago, I...

561
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,300
Let's not bring up stuff

562
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,260
from when you were a kid, okay?

563
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,060
Now, please focus

564
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,100
and learn.

565
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,860
If you mess this up,

566
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,500
my career is over.

567
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,860
Watch it.

568
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,420
Watch it.

569
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,340
Being arrogant.

570
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,540
Have you talked to the show's producers?

571
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,060
They're fine.

572
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,820
The hard part is the live audience.

573
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,740
Who knows if someone's recording
or taking videos?

574
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,420
With how fast things spread online,

575
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,180
it's hard to keep things hidden.

576
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,380
Go get the list from the production team

577
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,900
and contact them one by one.

578
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
If all else fails, give them gifts.

579
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,300
Mr. Li.

580
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Hello.

581
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,580
It's been a while.

582
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,660
Welcome to the show.

583
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
Can giving gifts keep them quiet?

584
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,540
Well, we have to make it work.

585
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,060
Hurry, come on.

586
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,580
Stop dragging your feet.

587
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,540
Come on, put this on.

588
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,140
Right here?

589
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,660
Where else?

590
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,740
Quick.

591
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,420
Hurry.

592
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,580
Put this on.

593
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,420
A thong?

594
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,180
How am I supposed to wear this?

595
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,020
Maybe better without it.

596
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,380
Heard

597
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,020
you put that fishmonger on stage.

598
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,900
If he messes up,

599
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,380
you'll be fully responsible.

600
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,460
You know what,

601
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,740
if something goes wrong, you won't
get away with it either.

602
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,780
Everyone, get ready.

603
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,460
Thirty-second countdown.

604
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,340
Don't be nervous.

605
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,380
You can do it.

606
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,740
From the start to the end of the stage,

607
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,180
the designated spot,

608
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,940
it's 25 steps.

609
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,700
Got it?

610
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,940
Suck in your stomach, chest out,

611
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,380
and look straight ahead.

612
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,980
Only move your legs and arms,

613
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,460
nothing else.

614
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,220
Then

615
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,620
walk in a straight line.

616
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,620
Fan,

617
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,740
straighten your back

618
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,700
and walk in a straight line.

619
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,420
Why are we walking like this?

620
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,500
Are we imitating robots?

621
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,700
We're

622
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,340
walking like cats.

623
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
That's why

624
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,860
it's called the catwalk.

625
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,980
Cats?

626
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,100
Cats walk like this.

627
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Silly boy,

628
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,980
we're learning to walk
in a straight line like cats.

629
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
So

630
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,420
when you grow up, you can become
a professional model,

631
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,460
walk on big stages,

632
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,740
and then

633
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,340
take on the world.

634
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,940
Are you happy?

635
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,740
Yes.

636
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,620
Get up, come on.

637
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,860
Well done.

638
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,780
Great job.

639
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,620
Come on, get up.

640
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,140
You really do have experience.

641
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,900
My teaching wasn't wasted.

642
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,300
I knew you could do it, kid.

643
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,540
You did well.

644
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,100
I told you.

645
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,140
How simple.

646
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,860
Good.

647
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,540
Good job.

648
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,140
Great, we did it.

649
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,180
Didn't expect that curly-haired guy
to have some skills.

650
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,740
Well, look who taught him.

651
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,660
He fell like that,

652
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,700
but he didn't flinch at all.

653
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,580
So, Yijing?

654
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,180
Did you see that?

655
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,020
Of course she did.

656
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,700
She's been glued to the screen.

657
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Her eyes are practically stuck…

658
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,980
Alright, my head hurts.

659
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,100
When will the celebration dinner start?

660
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,180
I'm starving.

661
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,700
Yeah.

662
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm starving too.

663
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,540
What are we having today?

664
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,220
Let me think.

665
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,500
No idea.

666
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,740
We'll have...

667
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,060
Not bad, huh?

668
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,860
Still in the mood to eat?

669
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,300
- Ms. Ling.
- Ms. Ling.

670
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Where were you two

671
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,220
during yesterday's recording

672
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,620
and today's backstage chaos?

673
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,500
I, uh…

674
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,100
Ask the person involved instead.

675
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,100
You've just made a comeback.

676
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,180
Can't you just stay low-key

677
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,220
and stop stirring up trouble?

678
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,980
Trouble just finds me.

679
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,100
Can't help it.

680
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
To stand out is to invite trouble.

681
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,500
You know, warrior, role model, all that.

682
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,700
Without those labels,

683
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,820
you wouldn't have gotten back

684
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,700
so quickly.

685
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,740
You're already 29.

686
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,740
You don't have many years left
in this industry.

687
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,380
You have to seize every opportunity.

688
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,300
Consider it your last shot.

689
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,460
What's the deal with that kid
who fell on stage?

690
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,660
You know him?

691
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,180
No.

692
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,660
Which agency is he with?

693
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,340
No idea.

694
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,460
A new face?

695
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,500
No.

696
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,940
Like I said, he's just a fill-in.

697
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm leaving now.

698
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,500
Aren't you going
to the celebration dinner?

699
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,180
Everyone's waiting for you...

700
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,340
Given my current state,

701
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,500
it's better to avoid trouble.

702
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,260
Thanks, Ms. Ling.

703
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,340
How did I do today

704
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,820
as a total rookie?

705
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,460
As a total rookie,

706
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,500
your acting wasn't bad.

707
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,180
Alright.

708
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,860
I'll take it as a compliment.

709
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,980
Not really.

710
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,500
You just pulled off a little trick.

711
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,820
Nothing worth praising.

712
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,620
Sorry.

713
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,860
I'm just blunt.

714
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,820
Want to hear a bit more?

715
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,500
Whatever.

716
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,980
I've already heard this much.

717
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,540
Hope

718
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,740
we never see each other again.

719
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,340
People who get a chance
to walk the runway

720
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,140
and then brag about it on their resumes

721
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,940
are a dime a dozen. So tacky.

722
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,220
Now that you've tried it,

723
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,620
you should know modeling isn't just

724
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,100
about putting on a sour face
and walking a few steps lazily.

725
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,300
Have you lost your memory?

726
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,140
If you hadn't forced me,

727
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,060
would I have been on that runway?

728
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,020
Good.

729
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,660
Good that you didn't break any bones.

730
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,860
Just ice it.

731
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,820
A stick, then a carrot, huh?

732
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,900
What's so great about models?

733
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,580
Hello, Warrior Han.

734
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,700
Long time no see.

735
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,180
Why do you always ignore me?

736
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,660
We're old friends.

737
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,620
That's so rude of you.

738
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
I just want to do an exclusive interview
about your comeback,

739
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,060
to help you say goodbye to the past

740
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,980
and start fresh. How about it?

741
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,500
[Recording]
I'm Huang Jinde, just an online writer.

742
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,940
If you want me to shut up,

743
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,100
name your price.

744
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,180
The sought-after supermodel,

745
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,020
dumped by her photographer boyfriend,

746
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,340
was chasing love

747
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,660
and crashing.

748
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,060
What crashed wasn't just the car,

749
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,140
but her image.

750
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,940
Warrior? Role model?

751
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,140
All a scam.

752
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,620
Let's be real, she's just
a foolish hopeless romantic.

753
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,700
I'm not asking for much, just 200,000.

754
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,180
Just drunk talk.

755
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,540
Is that really necessary?

756
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,220
If you've got the guts, go get evidence.

757
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,140
Otherwise, it's just slander

758
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
and extortion.

759
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,460
Stay away from me.

760
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,700
Don't show your face around me again.

761
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,540
Or

762
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,620
I'll make sure your losses
are greater than mine.

763
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,940
Delete the recording!

764
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,340
Give it to me.

765
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,620
Let go.

766
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,260
Get lost. Let go of me!

767
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,740
Let go!

768
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,220
Get lost!

769
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,060
Give me the phone.

770
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,740
Who are you?

771
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,060
Mind your own business.

772
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,420
Just a friendly reminder.

773
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,620
There are cameras everywhere here,

774
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,420
recording.

775
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,060
I don't care.

776
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,300
Move.

777
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,740
I'm telling you,

778
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,060
beating you to death
would count as a heroic act.

779
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,140
Fine.

780
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,540
Just you wait.

781
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,820
Are you okay?

782
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,380
What did you say?

783
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,340
