[Wanna Be]

2
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,670
Did they really pull the funding?

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,470
After all, ACME is the industry leader.

4
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,110
Without Han Yijing and Xing Mo,

5
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,150
ACME

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,640
is just an empty name.

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,350
Watch your tone.

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,560
You're too sensitive.

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,030
What he meant was...

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,320
There's still Han Jialing.

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,200
As long as Ms. Ling is here,

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,430
ACME won't fall apart.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,470
But where is Ms. Ling?

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,230
I caused such a huge mess

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,200
and she hasn't even shown up.

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,120
Then cause less trouble.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,920
Don't add to her burdens.

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,280
Then just don't leave.

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,510
Ming,

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,870
sign an extended contract with him.

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,840
Use actions to dispel the rumors

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,070
and stand firm with ACME.

23
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,680
That is an idea.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,870
Right?

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,120
Talking so much is useless.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,560
What matters is what you do.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,590
Let's drink properly tonight.

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,560
Shangmei has been rushing me.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,070
Their offer isn't bad.

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
Can you put in a word for me?

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,350
You're all too eager.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
What if you end up with nothing?

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
Then get lost now!

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,560
Haoran!

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,480
If you've already found another agency,
why come here?

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,790
Get out!

37
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,040
They approached us,

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,230
not the other way around.

39
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,680
Without ACME, you're nothing.

40
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
Ungrateful.

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,000
Then what?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
Should we all just wait here to die?

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
Say that again.

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,510
Enough!

45
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,510
Stop it.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,310
What are you doing?

47

What do you think you are?

48
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,310
And what are you?

Let him talk!

51
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,760
You can drink recklessly,

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,310
but you can't speak recklessly.

53
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,710
They are the ones leaving,

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,190

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,590
Yeah.

56

The alcohol's talking.

57
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,080
Don't be impulsive.

58
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,280
Even as someone who has been kicked out,

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
I can't stand this.

60
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,630
When things were good,
you fought tooth and nail to get in.

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,430
Now that things are bad,

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,520
you're the first to cut ties and run.

63
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,630
Right.

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Everyone looks out for themselves,

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
but we're a team.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,240
A team should enjoy blessings

67
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,680
and endure misfortune together.

68
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
Don't you think what you're doing

69
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,590

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,630
That's enough.

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,310
You're free to stay or go.

72
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,360
No one will stop anyone.

Mr. Wu.

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,960
That's not what we meant.

75
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
We want to stay too.

76
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,240
But online, everything is a mess.

77
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
We have no confidence.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
We can't tell what's real.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,960

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
Mr. Wu, we're not ungrateful.

82
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,190
We're just scared.

83
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,630
Scared?

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
Scared of what?

85
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,520
I've been with Ms. Ling
for so many years.

86
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,310
No matter how bad the storm got,

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,910
we always pulled through.

88
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,960
Every one of you here

89
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,280
was handpicked by Ms. Ling.

90
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,960
She believes in you.

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
You should also believe in her,

92
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,590
and ACME, too.

93
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I lost my composure.

94
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,750
I can't control myself after drinking.

95
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,360
Actually, I'm not worried
about ACME at all.

96
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm worried about Ms. Ling.

97
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,800
Other things are manageable,

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,600

99
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,190
who is her life.

100
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,630
She might not make it through.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
No.

102
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,390
Besides believing in her,

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,720
we must give her time.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,630
Right.

105
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,950
Other than waiting,

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,870
there's nothing we can do.

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Right now, whether it's Han Yijing

108
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,160
or ACME,

109
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,040
the only one who can help her

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,830
is Jia Fan.

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
Put on a jacket at night

112
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,510
so you won't catch a cold.

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,430
How did you...?

114
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,070
I was afraid
you wouldn't take care of yourself,

115
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,920
so I had to come check on you myself.

116
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,720
Since I heard waves on the phone,

117
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,270
I thought I'd try my luck by the sea.

118
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,510
And sure enough, I got lucky.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,000
Just treat me like a random stranger.

120
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,070
Don't mind me.

121
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,120
Enjoy yourself.

122
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,720
Don't get distracted.

123
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,360
If you feel like talking,

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,630
let me know.

125
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,950
I'm always here.

126
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,800
What if I feel cold?

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,630
That's easy.

Tomorrow will be cloudy.

but I'm the God of Luck.

If I want to see the sunrise,

136
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,630
the sun will rise as usual.

Why didn't you wake me?

Bad luck, as expected.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,390
It was cloudy this morning,

142
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,790
so I didn't wake you.

143

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
I just came to feed the cat.

197
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,750
Didn't know you were home.

198
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,630
Come on, eat.

199
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
Isn't this a bit insulting?

200
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,960
I really did come to feed the cat.

201
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,910
But I thought,

202
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,840
what if you're here?

203
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,030
At worst, I'd make a wasted trip.

204
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,840
Better than you starving alone.

205
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,870
I'm not hungry.

206
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,790
The cat has been fed.

207
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,630
You can go.

208
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,030
What about you?

209
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,870
When are you leaving?

210
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,630
Wu Ming has been drinking
at my place every night.

211
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,630
He drank till he was wasted.

212
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,120
There was no reasoning with him.

213
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,440
He said

214
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,630
he couldn't sleep without drinking.

215
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,630
I know you're blocking everything out
right now,

216
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,790
but I must tell you one thing.

217
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,240
ACME hasn't been just yours
for a long time.

218
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,320
It's just as important to other people.

219
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,440
So?

220
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
So don't shoulder everything alone.

221
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,960
Neither the company nor Han Yijing

222
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,240
is your fault.

223
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,000
I heard what Huang Jinde said that day.

224
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,440
All of it.

225
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,630
It's hard to accept at once,

226
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,320
and it's normal to vent.

227
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,870
But sadness passes in a few days.

228
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,600
You're not her.

229
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,750
You don't understand.

230
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,240
But I understand you.

231
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,480
Given another chance,

232
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,270
you'd do the same.

233
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,320
Since it has already been decided,

234
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,870
don't be so hard on yourself.

235
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,390
In my opinion,

236
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,320
she would've found out eventually.

237
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,320
Otherwise, the misunderstanding
between you two

238
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,550
would never be resolved.

239
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,480
You'd never truly get close.

240
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,960
And at her age now,

241
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,510
it's her prime.

242
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,150
It won't affect her personality

243
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,270
and there's no risk
she'd do something rash.

244
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,120
If it were during childhood

245
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,150
or her rebellious phase,

246
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,870
it'd be much worse.

247
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,910
It'd be much more troublesome than now.

248
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,150
By your logic,

249
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,080
I should thank Huang Jinde.

250
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,510
You should thank yourself.

251
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,870
Thank yourself for all you've done.

252
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,550
You saved Han Yijing.

253
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,200
Hello?

254
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,200
Ms. Ling,

255
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,910
two things to report.

256
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,670
First, the investors
moved their visit up

257
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,670
to next Friday.

258
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,750
Second,

259
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,910
Dr. Chen finally agreed
to a consultation.

260
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,310
It has been scheduled

261
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,550
for the 14th of next month,

262
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,590
at 10 AM.

263
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,030
I'll tell Jia Fan in a bit.

264
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,310
Now he can go to Rhône without worry.

265
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,200
Thanks for your hard work.

266
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,880
Not at all.

267
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,240
No need to be polite with me.

268
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,030
That's all for now.

269
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,030
I'll update you when there's more news.

270
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

271
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,790
I think you should still tell her.

272
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,830
Even if you don't tell Yijing,

273
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,880
at least let Ms. Ling know.

274
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,880
That's the deal.

275
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,750
I help you secure the doctor,

276
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,160
and you keep it secret for me.

277
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,200
Are you sure about this?

278
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,000
The cost is too high.

279
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,790
We're talking about
the editor-in-chief of Whim.

280
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,310
The only valuable thing I have left

281
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,440
is this position.

282
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,680
At least it's still useful to someone.

283
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,070
Besides, I've long tired of it anyway.

284
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,200
Photography suits me better.

285
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,680
Freer.

286
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,270
Thank you.

287
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,510
On behalf of Ms. Ling, Yijing,

288
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,830
and Jia Fan, thank you.

289
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,240
I owe you one.

290
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,350
I'll repay you someday.

291
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,160
No need.

292
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,790
I owe her.

293
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,000
Sometimes, the more I look at you,
the more you seem like a child.

294
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,480
What?

295
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,640
Han Yijing acts like a child.

296
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,350
At her age,

297
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,790
still running away from home.

298
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,310
Don't you dare.

299
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,440
Here.

300
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,790
No wonder everyone

301
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,200
treats you
like an emotional dumping ground.

302
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,240
I have to say,

303
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,790
you're really good at comforting people.

304
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,510
Congratulations.

305
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,750
You've finally found my strength.

306
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,070
You have more than one.

307
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,070
What?

308
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,750
Today's sandwich

309
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,070
is a bit sour.

310
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,510
It may be the blueberries.

311
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,680
Pay attention next time.

312
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,880
Okay.

313
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,160
Jia Fan asked me to tell you

314
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,200
that

315
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,000
Han Yijing is with him right now.

316
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,750
Don't worry.

317
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,550
Why didn't you say so earlier?

318
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,480
Next time.

319
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,200
Made me suffer for nothing.

320
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,800
[Shubo: How are you doing?]

321
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,440
[Han Jialing]
The doctor's appointment is set.

322
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,640
High success rate.

323
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,000
If it can cure his dad's eyes,

324
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,920
it can cure him too.

325
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,680
Don't worry.

326
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,590
Also,

327
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,880
Without your consent,

329
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,960
I decided your life for you.

330
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,400
But I don't regret it.

331
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,270
Though we've never

332
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,510
really gotten along all these years,

333
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,920
being able to grow up with you

334
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,830
is my greatest fortune.

335
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,880
Here, eat up.

336
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,310
Han Yijing.

337
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,640
Time to eat. Have some skewers.

338
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,790
You're not just my family,

339
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,000
you're my pride and joy.

340
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,400
Happy graduation.

341
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,000
Do you want the skewers in my left hand

342
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,720
or the skewers in my right hand?

343
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,680
Or in both hands? They're all yours.

344
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,510
Have I ever told you

345
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,270
your eyes are beautiful?

346
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,880
Dark and bright,

347
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,270
like stars in the sky.

348
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,640
You don't have to say it.

349
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,960
Yours are too.

350
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,030
With just one look,

351
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,240
I know what you're thinking.

352
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,000
Then what am I thinking?

353
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,920
You're wondering...

354
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,070
whether to tell her

355
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,830
that one day your eyes will fail.

356
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,550
Whether...

357
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,240
to leave her for France,

358
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,960
during her most difficult time.

359
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,590
Turns out, I can't keep
anything hidden after all.

360
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,880
Then let me give you the answer now.

361
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,790
No need.

362
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,240
You've known about my eyes all along?

363
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,110
But you don't care.

364
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,440
Whether I can see or not,

365
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,550
you won't leave me.

366
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,640
Even when you're going through
your hardest time,

367
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,310
I should go to France.

368
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,640
Not just for myself,

369
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,830
but for ACME too.

370
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,880
It's good that you know.

371
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,200
Han Yijing,

372
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,880
will you come to France with me?

373
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,680
No.

374
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,510
But I'll wait for you.

375
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,550
I'm only twenty-nine.

376
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,000
I can wait.

377
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,510
Don't worry.

378
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm Han Yijing.

379
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,750
I don't give up easily.

380
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,030
Never forget

381
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,680
that you have me.

382
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,750
Tell me everything as soon as possible.

383
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,070
No lies.

384
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,640
Eat on time.

385
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,750
Listen to the doctor.

386
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,790
No late nights.

387
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,240
I know.

388
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,510
Take care of yourself.

389
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,720
Wait for me.

390
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,350
I'll wait for you.

391
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,750
All four kings are here.

392
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,030
We're in real trouble.

393
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,400
ACME will be fine.

394
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,440
It's Ms. Ling.

395
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,310
After all this time,
how can they just fire her?

396
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,510
How heartless.

397
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,400
Businessmen must be brutal.

398
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,040
[ACME]

399
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,510
It has been two hours.

400
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,480
They're still not done.

401
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,160
The longer it takes, the riskier it is.

402
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,110
I've got a bad feeling.

403
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,750
Don't jinx it.

404
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,960
Ms. Ling.

405
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,240
We believe

406
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,510
you knew nothing from start to finish.

407
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,790
After all,

408
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,510
you built ACME from scratch.

409
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,590
No one has invested more in it

410
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,720
than you.

411
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,110
Regardless,

412
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,550
thank you for your years of hard work.

413
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,110
I can't say it has been hard work,

414
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,440
but I've done my best.

415
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,030
Thank you all for your support.

416
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,070
From now on...

417
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,110
From now on...

418
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,030
we'll still need your efforts.

419
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,960
We're facing some challenges right now,

420
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,680
but in the long term,

421
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,400
prospects are still good.

422
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,830
After that rookie,

423
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,750
Jia Fan,

424
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,880
returns from France,

425
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,400
he'll be the next

426
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,720
benchmark,

427
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,640
ACME's new ace.

428
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,680
I believe...

429
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,720
Mr. Li.

430
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,590
Over in Rhône,

431
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,640
they did invite Jia Fan,

432
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,000
but

433
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,550
he hasn't agreed yet.

434
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,590
He has.

435
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,480
- He has?
- He has?

436
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,750
You didn't know?

437
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,200
Mr. Li.

438
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,750
We haven't been able
to speak to him yet.

439
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,790
Where did you hear this?

440
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,640
Xing Mo

441
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,000
called me

442
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,200
last night.

443
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,070
We talked a lot.

444
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,790
After discussing Jia Fan,

445
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,550
he mentioned You Ning.

446
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,880
He said her shift to acting

447
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,880
isn't just her personal attempt,

448
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,590
but also an opportunity

449
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,830
for ACME.

450
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,440
If successful,

451
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,310
it'll open new doors.

452
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,070
Aside from model management,

453
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,000
there will be other possibilities.

454
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,350
I think it makes perfect sense.

455
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,240
We believe
with You Ning's qualifications

456
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,960
and her own hard work,

457
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,720
there should be no problem.

458
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,310
Then he started talking about himself.

459
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,440
Even though his contract was terminated,

460
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,550
he'll still stay at ACME

461
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,070
as a mentor,

462
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,270
focusing on training new recruits

463
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,920
and being your right-hand man.

464
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,790
As for Han Yijing...

465
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,440
given her relationship with you,

466
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,720
even if she can't be a model
in the future,

467
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,510
she can still collaborate with you
in other ways.

468
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,830
At least she won't join a competitor,

469
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,110
right?

470
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,510
Xing Mo told you that as well?

471
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,590
Actually, I can tell

472
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,830
these are their own thoughts.

473
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,590
Xing Mo is just the messenger.

474
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,550
Honestly,

475
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,440
I never expected Han Jialing,

476
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,550
who is always decisive

477
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,720
and ruthless in business,

478
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,400
to have so many people standing by you.

479
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,590
They're loyal,

480
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,030
staying by your side in tough times.

481
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,400
It must be because you're worth it.

482
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,110
When running a business,

483
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,920
being strict

484
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,960
is very easy,

485
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,720
but winning hearts

486
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,030
is the hardest part.

487
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,310
All this proves you're irreplaceable.

488
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,480
So,

489
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,830
we've unanimously decided

490
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,920
to keep supporting you.

491
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,310
We believe

492
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,590
you'll lead ACME

493
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,640
out of this crisis

494
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,160
and into the light.

495
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,350
Ms. Ling is here.

496
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,880
- Ms. Ling!
- Ms. Ling!

497
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,110
Ms. Ling!

498
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,830
So?

499
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,640
Is everything okay?

500
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,510
Ms. Ling.

501
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,830
If you leave, we leave too.

502
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,720
None of us will stay.

503
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,270
- Yes.
- Yes.

504
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,920
Hitting the director?

505
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,960
Who gave you the guts?

506
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,750
I've assigned you a new acting coach.

507
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,310
If something like this happens again,

508
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,790
report it to the company immediately,

509
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,680
and the company will stand up for you.

510
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,960
Understood.

511
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,000
And the rest of you,

512
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,550
why are you at a bar in broad daylight

513
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,550
instead of doing training at the office?

514
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,200
Don't let it happen again!

515
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,680
Make us proud.

516
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,550
The future is in your hands!

517
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,200
Yay!

518
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,880
- Yay!
- Yay!

519
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,640
Don't worry, Ms. Ling.

520
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,680
We'll make you proud.

521
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,960
We won't let ACME down.

522
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,960
Right.

523
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,640
As long as you're here,

524
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,830
all of us feel secure.

525
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,590
Crying again?

526
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,640
A grown man tearing up all the time.

527
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm just happy.

528
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,200
Go ahead.

529
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:40,960
It's okay.

530
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,000
In the future,

531
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,310
I'll keep fighting alongside everyone

532
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,590
to prove to the world

533
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,000
that ACME is the industry's leader

534
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,480
and you're the best!

535
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:03,270
- Number one!
- Number one!

536
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,680
Ms. Ling.

537
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,310
You Ning.

538
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,550
Did you bring the contract?

539
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,960
I found out too suddenly.

540
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,640
I didn't have time to prepare it.

541
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,550
Hurry up, then.

542
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,240
Or I might change my mind.

543
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,350
Monday at 10 AM,

544
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,440
see you at the office.

545
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,550
Deal.

546
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,550
Congratulations.

547
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,790
Thanks,

548
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,960
Mr. Xing.

549
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,310
I heard your acting
is still way over the top.

550
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,400
You should work on that.

551
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,920
Oh.

552
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,510
So now,

553
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,280
shall we go?

554
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,710
Let's go.

555
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,880
Let's go!

556
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,150
Off we go!
