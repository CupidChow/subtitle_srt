2
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,710
Hello, Ms. Kang.

4
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,040
- Just coming in?
- Yes.

5
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,270
When did they become one?

6
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,720
Come in, sir.

7
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,190
Mr. Lee!

8
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,200
Take care.

9
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,330
I said I'll give you a share of land.

10
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,110
Later. If you get the share, come back then.

11
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,790
Please leave now for today.

12
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,080
- Take care!
- I said I can leave on my own!

13
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,620
Gosh, seriously!

14
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,750
Look at you, smiling like this.

15
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,060
You don't even know what this is. Geez.

16
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,200
Hello.

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,900
Attorney Cho, show up earlier.
Do I need to tend to stuff like this?

18
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,550
Geez.

19
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,990
Well, what's going on?

20
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,540
I understand what you mean.

21
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,700
But I can't because I have too much to do.

22
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
- Please visit somewhere else.
- Geez.

23
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,430
Are you the only attorney here?

24
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,260
Give it to another attorney.

25
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,790
Well, we're a small firm.

26
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,200
Hey. I said I'll give you a share of land!

27
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,190
- I'm so sorry.
- Geez.

28
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,480
Hello, how can I help you?

29
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,310
I wanted to get a new card since it's old.

30
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,200
How would you like the new debit card, then?

31
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,600
It's easy to get cash back.
Many people get it to save easily.

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,980
I'll go with that, then.

33
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,510
Okay. Please wait until the card gets made.

34
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,110
Okay.

35
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,380
You have a plan for small businesses, too.

36
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,130
Yes, we do. We have many plans.

37
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,300
We provide low-interest loans
and investment classes.

38
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,750
Okay, here's the card.

39
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,170
I'll give you the stickers to decorate the card.

40
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,280
How cute. Thank you.

41
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,410
Attorney Kang, Seoul Central District Court

42
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,220
is asking if you can be the public
defender for a trial on May 10.

43
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,400
What should I tell them?

44
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,200
- Tell them I'm available.
- Okay.

45
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,490
This is your first case as a public defender.

46
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,340
Yes. I finally get to have one.

47
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,520
What kind of case is it?

48
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm not sure yet.

49
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,780
They just asked if I was available.

50
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,280
Did you get approval from Ms. Kang?

51
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,400
I signed up because she approved a while ago.

52
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Things got a bit awkward during
the inheritance renouncing case.

53
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,680
Maybe I should ask her again.

54
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,290
Didn't a strange old man visit
your office this morning?

55
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,150
Huh? Did he go there, too?

56
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,980
He brought a strange paper with Chinese characters

57
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,880
and said he owns a huge plot of land.

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,860
Yes. He brought a document that
belongs in the National Archives.

59
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,650
You've never even been there.

60
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,770
- Have you, then?
- Of course, I have.

61
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,090
I had a decorated veteran case once.

62
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,900
According to what our partner said,

63
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,120
he's been to many firms.

64
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,400
Because he said he can't pay the legal fee.

65
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
- We must've kicked him out, then.
- Probably.

66
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,390
I thought your partner would accept the case.

67
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,740
My partner isn't that easy, either.

68
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,820
I see.

69
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,320
What's the deal? The lunch hour
isn't even over yet.

70
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
- What is it?
- Our partner is looking for me. I have to go.

71
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,540
I'll clean up. You can go.

72
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,940
Thanks. Let's go.

73
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,460
Okay.

74
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Let's go to the cafe. I need caffeine.

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,100
No, no. I have a lot to do, too.

76
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,880
I can't go to the cafe, either.

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
- Would you like one?
- Sure.

78
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,620
- Would you like one, too?
- Thank you.

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,060
Here you go.

80
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,660
I feel better now.

81
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,610
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

82
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,650
Sunbae, clean up first!

83
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,960
I want you two to take a real estate case.

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,990
Are we taking that old man's case?

85
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,990
You know about it?

86
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,630
Yes, I heard from other attorneys.

87
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,850
It's unusual for you to take a case like this.

88
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,180
What's "A case like this"?

89
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,690
I heard he can't pay the legal fee.

90
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,030
We'll get a share if he gets the land back.

91
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,510
It's a pretty sizable land.

92
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,470
We agreed to pay the trial expenses,

93
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,570
but we'd score big if we win.

94
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,630
Please take it.

95
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,090
- Is this all?
- Yes, that's apparently all of it.

96
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,130
W-What do we do with just this?

97
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,980
Will you really do stuff like this?

98
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,950
What's with everyone these days?

99
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,820
You have a lot of complaints.

100
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,170
Let's just do as we normally do.

101
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,070
Okay?

102
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,470
Yes, Attorney Kang. How can I help you?

103
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,390
Ms. Kang,

104
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,530
I got a call for a public defense case.

105
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,120
Could I take it?

106
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,740
Of course. You didn't have to ask me that.

107
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,570
I wanted to make sure.

108
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,640
I said you could last time.

109
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,380
Yes. Thank you.

110
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,950
Create a system where you can share a new case

111
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,090
info immediately for each floor, please.

112
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,340
So, we won't be taking the same
case on the opposing side.

113
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,200
And...

114
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,890
allow each floor to hire their own
accountant and create records, too.

115
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,680
Will you continue to work here, Executive Director?

116
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,010
Must be hard going back and forth
between here and the foundation.

117
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,250
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm okay.

118
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,840
But people are saying you
only care about the law firm.

119
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,760
Both the foundation and the
company employees say that.

120
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,530
The employees and executives are doing great.

121
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,840
I was feeling thankful.

122
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,600
I guess I've been kind of lax.

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Thank you for letting me know.
I'll be more careful.

124
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,110
This law firm isn't your foundation work or your business.

125
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,810
May I ask why you care about it so much?

126
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes. Looks good.

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,910
I'll take these two.

128
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,060
- Please take the rest.
- Okay.

129
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,950
Right, we got another case.

130
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,330
It's a real estate contract issue.

131
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,730
The client is young. Please have
a consultation with him.

132
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,270
Got it.

133
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,500
Have you...

134
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,590
thought about what I gave you?

135
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,620
The doctoral program.

136
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,900
Yes. That.

137
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,580
Thank you for thinking of me,

138
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,820
but I'm not going to do it.

139
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,260
Why not?

140
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,110
They don't hire you after if you work
while in the program.

141
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,420
Did the school say that?

142
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,170
Yes.

143
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,340
I should be working here.

144
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,380
I'm not going anywhere and leaving you behind.

145
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,430
I'll go to my office to work, then.

146
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,930
Okay...

147
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,510
Attorneys aren't supposed
to be sitting around all the time.

148
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,650
You need to be on your feet.

149
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,350
Or be better at listening.

150
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,890
So, after the liberation and the Korean War,

151
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,490
other people took this land from you.

152
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,050
That's right.

153
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,380
After the war ended,

154
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,200
the ownership suddenly went to the Kwak family.

155
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,730
We can't confirm much
with just this piece of paper.

156
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,230
Do things change if there are two pieces of paper?

157
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,870
There was only one to begin with.

158
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,280
The attorneys should be figuring out the rest.

159
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,700
Here, here, here. Look, look.

160
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,930
Here.

161
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,760
Doheung-myeon.

162
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,750
It's Doheung-eup now.

163
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,030
No. 580.

164
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:06,590
Here. 39,554 pyeong.

165
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,630
Daejeong Year Three.

166
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,240
Daejeong is a period when
we were occupied by Japan.

167
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,450
And here. Han In Su.

168
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,900
I understand what's written there.

169
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,800
We're saying we can't tell what
happened from this alone.

170
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,620
The address that's written here
doesn't exist anymore.

171
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,300
What's your relationship
to Mr. Han In Su, Mr. Park?

172
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,390
- We're family.
- What's your relationship specifically?

173
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,670
It means we're closer than any family.

174
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,080
You aren't family just because you share blood.

175
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,930
You mean you aren't related, right?

176
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,280
Come on. Look, look.

177
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,430
I'm not trying to take back my land.

178
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,720
Look at this.

179
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,200
They're Han In Su's great-grandchildren.

180
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,420
So, you aren't related to him at all.

181
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,270
Why are you trying to get this land back?

182
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,680
Everyone in the neighborhood knows
the land belongs to Mr. Han.

183
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,310
But no one's saying anything.

184
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,630
Why? Because all the elders
in his family had passed away.

185
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,500
Come with me. You'll see when you go there.

186
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,870
- We don't need to go.
- Let's go.

187
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,250
What? Really? Really? Really?

188
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,680
Okay, let's get going.

189
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,560
Let's get going now.

190
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,500
Are you really going?

191
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,900
We need to check if the power
of attorney is real. Let's go.

192
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,060
I signed a contract through a real estate agency,

193
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,100
but the owner told me to leave,
saying they never signed that contract.

194
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,840
You've never met the owners?

195
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,000
No. The real estate agency said
they had the power of attorney.

196
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
They even showed me the document.

197
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,530
Power of attorney...

198
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,340
The power of attorney document isn't here.

199
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,590
They said I can only see it,
but they can't give it to me.

200
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,440
That's not true. If you haven't met the owner,

201
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,730
you have to make sure you
have the power of attorney.

202
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,450
If so,

203
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,680
I messed that up, too.

204
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,040
Did you sign alone?

205
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,010
I used to live in an orphanage.

206
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,190
I barely managed to get this
with the independence fund.

207
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,100
I had no one to ask about it.

208
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,740
I see.

209
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,340
It's okay. This isn't your fault, Yun Su.

210
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,270
These people are the bad ones.

211
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,340
I think the agency created a fake contract

212
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,130
to take your security deposit.

213
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,230
I was settling down there,

214
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,500
but they suddenly sent an eviction notice.

215
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,580
I don't know what's going on.

216
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,250
I have nowhere to go if I get kicked out.

217
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,270
It's okay. Yun Su,

218
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,170
you know where the agency is located, right?

219
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,570
It wasn't me.

220
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,490
It was an employee I had.

221
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,710
I don't know where he went now.

222
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,340
Tell him, young man. I didn't do it.

223
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,180
Even so, if your employee did,

224
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,560
you still have the employer's liability.

225
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,940
I'll compensate if I have to.

226
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,070
Go ahead and sue.

227
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,200
Did you work with the landlord for a long time?

228
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,230
He owns the entire studio apartment building.

229
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,060
Yes. I've worked with him for a long time.

230
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,530
But not anymore because of this.

231
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,610
Is he an understanding person, then?

232
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,590
Gosh, no. He's strictly by the book.

233
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,880
Your employee showed a power
of attorney to Yun Su.

234
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,290
What's that about?

235
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,600
There couldn't have been a power of attorney.

236
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,290
Why did this happen only to me?

237
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,780
Don't think about it like that.

238
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,760
It's my fault for not looking into it.

239
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,150
I know. But...

240
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,470
everyone in that building signed
the contract through them.

241
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,630
People live there without any issues.

242
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,390
Why did this only happen to me?

243
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,620
You just had a bit of bad luck.
There's no other reason.

244
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,740
Everyone signed the contract through that agency.

245
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,240
But no one else had any issues.

246
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,090
(speech)

247
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,000
This place was designated

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
as an industrial complex zone or something.

249
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,890
The property values skyrocketed.

250
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,530
I tried to forget about it, but hearing that

251
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,530
made me so angry. I couldn't just sit still.

252
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,250
All of this belonged to one person?

253
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,630
Yes.

254
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,300
The Kwak family shared it among themselves.

255
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,330
The government took some, too.

256
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,120
- What about beyond this stream?
- Huh?

257
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,430
No, no. Not there.

258
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,350
Make it quick.

259
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,150
I'm already 80 and...

260
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,000
Mr. Han's great-grandchildren
aren't young, either.

261
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Why aren't they doing anything?

262
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,600
Because all of the elders
in that family died early on,

263
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,110
so they struggled since they were young.

264
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,220
They still receive the basic living fund.

265
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,250
They can't afford to do this because
they're busy making a living.

266
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,250
You said they still live here, right?

267
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,440
Oh, the great-grandchildren?

268
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,870
Yes. Could we meet them?

269
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,890
Oh, here comes one. Hey!

270
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,040
Hello.

271
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,250
Thank you so much for coming
all the way here, Attorneys.

272
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,250
Come on. I told them they have
to see it in person.

273
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,580
What else could they do?

274
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,360
If I don't resolve this before I die,

275
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,800
I'll regret it forever.

276
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,980
Gosh, you should live for
a long time. Don't say that.

277
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,780
Nothing works in this neighborhood without him.

278
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,650
Hey.

279
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,520
Follow me. We aren't done yet.

280
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,430
Bye.

281
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,090
Okay.

282
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,820
Take this with you, too.

283
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,900
And...

284
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,210
Okay...

285
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,640
Here it is. Yes.

286
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,590
Have a look at this, too.

287
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,830
It must be somewhere here.

288
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,830
Here it is. Here it is.

289
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,600
This is the petition I sent to the village office.

290
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,970
This is the article in the local newspaper.

291
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,930
What would you like us to do with this?

292
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,910
Come on.

293
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,780
You need to figure that out.

294
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,020
Am I the attorney?

295
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,330
But there isn't much we can do with these.

296
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,040
Aigoo.

297
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,520
So, that's what you're supposed
to figure out for me.

298
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,350
He wasn't a fraud, at least.

299
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,830
The power of attorney was real, too.

300
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,230
In the end, these documents are the issue.

301
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,840
What will you do?

302
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,160
I should try to find something.

303
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,640
Let's check the videos we took and...

304
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,490
- compare them to the cadastral map.
- Okay.

305
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,340
Let's pay attention to the lot shapes.

306
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,130
- The shape of the stream is...
- The boundaries are here, too.

307
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,670
We should look up...

308
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,620
No. 580.

309
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,880
102,882.7 square meters.

310
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,130
It's 31,122 pyeong.

311
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,570
30,000...

312
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,930
- It doesn't match?
- No.

313
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,150
That old man was talking nonsense, then.

314
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,760
He was either mistaken or lying.

315
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,350
Yes, Sunbae. What's up?

316
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,290
Hey, Mun Jeong.

317
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,769
Are you interested in returning
to the company in-house?

318
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,645
Pardon?

319
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,810
It looked like you were
interested in our company.

320
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,790
A position just opened up.

321
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,420
I called you because I thought of you.

322
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh, really?

323
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,270
Well, maybe I had the wrong impression.

324
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,820
No, no.

325
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,040
Could I think about it and get back to you?

326
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,370
Yes, yes. Of course.

327
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,380
Hey, watch your leg! Be careful.

328
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,810
I'm sorry.

329
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,120
There will be an announcement soon.

330
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,950
I'll send you the info beforehand.

331
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,250
- Have a look and let me know.
- Okay.

332
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,580
Thank you, Sunbae.

333
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,420
Attorney Kang, the public defender
appointment letter came.

334
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,180
I put it on your desk.

335
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,370
Oh, it came? Thank you.

336
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,870
Murder?

337
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,550
"Fact summary.

338
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,470
For about 10 years,

339
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,400
the defendant cared for the victim,
Jeong Myeong Jae, who had

340
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,900
dementia at 1257-5, Murim-dong, Seongak-gu, Seoul.

341
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,800
Crime summary.

342
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,730
On January 23, 2025, at around 15:30,

343
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,930
the defendant decided to kill Mr. Jeong,

344
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,820
bedridden from dementia and aspiration pneumonia.

345
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,520
She suffocated him by strangling him

346
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,280
and ended up killing him."

347
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,400
Attorney Ha.

348
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,880
Hey.

349
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,430
You were here already.

350
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,580
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

351
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,590
- Who is it?
- Hello.

352
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,570
Hello.

353
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,740
Hello.

354
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,280
I'm Attorney Ha Sang Gi from Law Group Hyungmin.

355
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,290
There was a lease contract issue in this building.

356
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,050
I was hoping to get your help.

357
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,400
You have the contract, right?

358
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,790
- What about it?
- Could we just take a photo-

359
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,070
No, no.

360
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,640
Leave. No, no.

361
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,760
But the contract-

362
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,940
- Contract?
- Yes.

363
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,790
There won't be any legal issues.

364
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,140
I just want to have a look at it.

365
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,180
Thank you. Thank you.

366
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,730
You can call this number if you're concerned.

367
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,250
Thank you so much. Thank you.

368
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,260
Which floor are we on?

369
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,380
You should've told me there's no elevator.

370
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,180
You said the landlord never
gave you the power of attorney.

371
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,400
Every contract we confirmed came with a power of attorney.

372
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,290
I didn't say they never did.

373
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,260
I said, when he signed the contract,

374
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,980
there shouldn't have been a power of attorney.

375
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,480
Okay. We had it back then.

376
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,700
We signed the lease contracts
on behalf of the landlord then.

377
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,470
But they told us to stop
and only be the intermediary.

378
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,450
So, I threw away the power of attorney.

379
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,780
You should've told me that before.

380
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,170
Hey, you didn't ask me specifically.

381
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,840
It's not like I lied.

382
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,970
Out of these studio apartments,

383
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,080
how many did you sign with
after you lost the power of attorney?

384
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,140
One.

385
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,890
One?

386
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,400
Only me?

387
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,700
We signed with the power of attorney before him.

388
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,870
But the landlord said he wants to stop doing that.

389
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,760
What were we supposed to do? It was up to him.

390
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,130
And he happened to be the first applicant,

391
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,730
but that guy pretended we still
had the power of attorney,

392
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,100
scammed him, and ran away.

393
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,620
I guess I have really poor luck.

394
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,630
Why did it start with me?

395
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,530
No.

396
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,970
You might be incredibly lucky.

397
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,530
Well, how do these not match?

398
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,030
Did you calculate correctly?

399
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,080
Why does the size not match?

400
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,520
Geez, seriously.

401
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,990
I guess the size calculation has changed

402
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,540
since the Japanese colonial period.

403
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,400
We checked, but it hasn't changed.

404
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,500
- Do you have the original copy of this?
- Seriously.

405
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,710
Let's say this document is wrong.

406
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,910
But everyone in the neighborhood knows that

407
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,170
they own that land for generations.

408
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,000
All the evidence we have is this piece of paper

409
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,220
and your words.

410
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,300
But even they don't match.

411
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,060
Are you saying I lied, then?

412
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,340
Forget it. I'll hire someone else.

413
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,200
Why are you taking it this far?

414
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,030
What are you talking about?

415
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,750
You said this isn't even your land.

416
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,300
Are you sure you have nothing to gain here?

417
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,290
Do you only do what benefits you?

418
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,500
Who else would do this but me?

419
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,750
I'm doing it because someone needs to.

420
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,380
Forget it. That's it for today.

421
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,420
Good work.

422
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,710
So, did the old man just leave like that?

423
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,070
Yes. He probably went to a different firm.

424
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,150
He was strange from the beginning.

425
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,160
He could just be mistaken.

426
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,880
Let's eat.

427
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,000
The pregnant woman will serve herself first.

428
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,000
Did you get the public defender
appointment letter yet?

429
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,590
I got it. But it's a murder case.

430
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,260
- What?
- Gosh.

431
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,200
Have you all had a murder case before?

432
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,430
Yes. I had one once.

433
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,390
But mine was a really bad man.

434
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,680
Is it a very cruel case?

435
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,260
I'm not sure.

436
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,790
In one sense, it seems like the most cruel case

437
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,450
and then, it doesn't.

438
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,390
Someone killed her younger brother, whom she cared for over 10 years.

439
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,220
Makes you think it must've been tough for her.

440
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,590
Hey, a person died, though.

441
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,680
I'm not sure what to think of this case, either.

442
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,270
I'm not sure if I could understand the client.

443
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,200
Eat first. Eat, eat.

444
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,820
Okay.

445
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,660
There's always one public defense case

446
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,590
you end up getting emotionally involved.

447
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,470
It's normal to feel conflicted.

448
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,150
I thought you'd tell me not to be invested because it's work.

449
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,610
Of course, it'd be better if you weren't.

450
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,530
But you can't help it.

451
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,690
Do you feel for that old man, your client?

452
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,340
I guess I wanted to believe him this time.

453
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,700
I wanted what Mr. Park said to be true.

454
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,560
Including how he was doing it out of goodwill.

455
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,280
What a shame.

456
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,200
Do you know you've changed lately?

457
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,780
Thanks to you.

458
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,010
Manager,

459
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,920
please copy Ms. Jeong's public
defense case records

460
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,410
and request a visit for me.

461
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,510
Okay, got it.

462
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,780
Please display Evidence No. 5.

463
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,340
These contracts were signed by tenants
who live in the plaintiff's building.

464
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,800
It shows that every one of them

465
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,340
were signed by the real estate agency as a proxy.

466
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,380
Please display Evidence No. 6.

467
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,200
Yes.

468
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,990
As you can see, only the dates were left blank.

469
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,840
They were written in by hand.

470
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,670
All of the power of attorney
documents are like that.

471
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,580
Which means the plaintiff, the landlord,

472
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,460
gave the agency dozens of signed power of attorney

473
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,600
and let them write down the date
whenever they use it.

474
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,700
The plaintiff didn't collect
the rest of the documents

475
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,460
even after the deal with the agency had ended.

476
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,450
Therefore, the defendant saw
the document signed by the plaintiff

477
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,680
and believed the agency still
had the power of attorney.

478
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,290
Since the plaintiff was responsible
for making the defendant think that,

479
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,690
following the Civil Code 129,

480
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,590
the defendant's lease contract
should be effective.

481
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,400
Plaintiff's counsel,

482
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,650
is it true that the power of attorney
forms weren't collected?

483
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,770
My client was told the agency had destroyed it.

484
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,250
He was told that, but he didn't
collect them. Correct?

485
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,100
No. That's how I understand it.

486
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,290
Let's do this.

487
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,050
The court will issue a settlement recommendation.

488
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,360
The plaintiff will withdraw the lawsuit

489
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,500
and send an order to reinstate the lease contract.

490
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,860
The plaintiff's counsel should
convince the plaintiff.

491
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,420
The plaintiff is a victim, too.

492
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,240
The defendant is a victim, too.

493
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,690
Since you provided a reason for this to happen,

494
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,490
you have to be responsible
according to the apparent authority law.

495
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,090
Yes.

496
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,510
- Defense counsel.
- Yes.

497
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,680
With the settlement recommendation,

498
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,660
you know each party pays
for their trial fee, right?

499
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,640
- Yes.
- You can't demand

500
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,150
compensation from the plaintiff.

501
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,510
Are you okay with that?

502
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,410
Yes, we're okay with that.

503
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,700
Okay. I'll send the settlement
recommendation, then.

504
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,790
The decision will be solidified
if you don't appeal in two weeks.

505
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:05,390
Thank you. We'll move on to the next trial.

506
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,300
Attorney Ha,

507
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,420
thank you.

508
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,050
Thank you...

509
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,610
Thank you very much, Attorney Ha.

510
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,910
We were lucky.

511
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,290
I told you. You're a very lucky person.

512
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,860
Thank you, Attorney Ha.

513
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,120
Aren't you hungry? Should we go get food?

514
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,820
Let's go.

515
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,170
Take your time. Take your time.

516
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,080
Attorney Ha, you're really cool.

517
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,340
Pardon?

518
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,390
You took care of everything.

519
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,770
I want to go to college and become like you.

520
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,640
Are you studying something right now?

521
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,110
Yes. I was preparing for college admission,

522
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,210
- but I'm thinking of quitting.
- Why?

523
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,200
I need to make money...

524
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,240
and I have a younger sibling.
He's leaving the orphanage soon.

525
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,660
I need to take care of him.

526
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,490
I don't think I could afford to study.

527
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:07,250
Well, even if you can't now,

528
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,880
don't give up on your dream completely.

529
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,050
It's all cooked.

530
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,410
Thank you.

531
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,430
Please check if there are
scholarship certifications left.

532
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,230
Yes.

533
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,750
No, you should have them, Mom.

534
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,310
It's because there's someone I want to help.

535
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,970
Okay, okay. Got it. Bye.

536
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,070
Have you thought about it?

537
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,110
- About what?
- Joining the company.

538
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,190
I'm not doing it. It doesn't suit me.

539
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,610
You think being an attorney suits you?

540
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,380
I won't run a business even
if I quit being an attorney.

541
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,540
I would've joined your company
from the beginning if I were interested.

542
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,200
I didn't start the business
because I loved it, either.

543
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,010
I eventually found what suits me.
That's what happened.

544
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,020
I didn't become an attorney
because I loved it, either.

545
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,790
But I'll try to find what suits me.

546
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,070
Seriously.

547
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,460
You got your stubbornness from me.

548
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,700
I know.

549
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,660
That's why running the business
would suit you, too.

550
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,460
Seriously.

551
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,000
I have a plan, too.

552
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,220
- What plan?
- Just wait and see.

553
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm preparing something.

554
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,860
What about beyond this stream?

555
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,570
No, no. Not there.

556
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,140
That old man was talking nonsense, then.

557
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,800
He was either mistaken or lying.

558
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,900
Nothing works in this neighborhood without him.

559
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey.

560
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,030
Do you feel for that old man, your client?

561
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,810
I wanted what Mr. Park said to be true.

562
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,840
Including how he was doing it out of goodwill.

563
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,240
Do you only do what benefits you?

564
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,880
Who else would do this but me?

565
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,210
I'm doing it because someone needs to.

566
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,760
He brought a document that
belongs in the National Archives.

567
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,610
You've never even been there.

568
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,430
- Have you, then?
- Of course, I have.

569
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,770
I had a decorated veteran case once.

570
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,128
The National Archives documents
are public now, right?

571
00:43:24,128 --> 00:43:25,240
Huh?

572
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,510
No. 580, Dongjan-ri.

573
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,770
Here. Check the one that says "Han In Su."

574
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,320
Okay.

575
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,800
Let's print everything under Han In Su.

576
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,340
Okay.

577
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,840
No. 580 was one big lot back then.

578
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,310
But the shape is different than
what the old man said.

579
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,160
This part?

580
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,890
(speech) Here.

581
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,390
I'll print the registers for these areas.

582
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,390
384...

583
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,600
130,757.1

584
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:04,080
In pyeong, it's 39,554.

585
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,260
Here. 39,554 pyeong.

586
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,920
Mr. Park Man Su was right.

587
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,300
Hello.

588
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,110
I'm Attorney Kang Hui Ji, your public defender.

589
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,720
Yes.

590
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,580
Isn't it difficult being in the detention center?

591
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,520
I don't need an attorney.

592
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,270
I didn't request a public defender.

593
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,410
Who told you to come here?

594
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:26,760
The court requires you to have a public defender.

595
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,060
Even if you didn't request it,

596
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,580
you qualify for the court to assign
a public defender for you.

597
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,680
Just do what you need to do and leave.

598
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,910
Don't worry about me.

599
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,860
What I need to do is... to hear your story first.

600
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,870
About what happened and why you did that.

601
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:53,710
Hearing won't change anything.

602
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,880
I killed Myeong Jae...

603
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,350
and I need to be punished.

604
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,110
Then, your reasons won't be acknowledged.

605
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:10,310
There are no reasons... to kill someone.

606
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,600
I'm not interested in being
understood or being forgiven, either.

607
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,220
Just leave.

608
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,780
I'm not saying I'll understand you.

609
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,640
I have no right to forgive you, either.

610
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,770
As you said, you'll be punished
regardless of the situation.

611
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,580
Yes.

612
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,780
That's why...

613
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,790
you should let me be punished.

614
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:46,950
Can I leave...

615
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,300
if you've got nothing more to say?

616
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,750
I killed my younger brother.

617
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,110
I killed him...

618
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,860
and I'll be punished for it.

619
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,650
Yes.

620
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,640
Attorney, Ms. Jeong Sun Ja's children are here.

621
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,700
Her children?

622
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:04,080
Are you Ms. Jeong's son and daughter?

623
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,610
Yes.

624
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,030
What would happen to Mom?

625
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,490
She'll be on trial soon.

626
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,830
But she won't say anything to me.

627
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,240
It's a bit hard for me to prepare for the trial.

628
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,070
How did she end up living with her brother?

629
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,160
I thought she didn't have children.

630
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,190
The thing is...

631
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,560
Mom was the only family Uncle had.

632
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,790
That's why she lived with him and cared for him.

633
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,950
Did you stay with them sometimes, then?

634
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,200
No.

635
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,370
We didn't think it was something
for us to worry about.

636
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:49,040
How did Ms. Jeong afford her
living expenses, then?

637
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,910
She probably had a pension
and a caretaking subsidy.

638
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,070
And you didn't help her at all?

639
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:01,930
No. We couldn't really afford to do so, either.

640
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,080
Can she get out?

641
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,420
The charge is murder.

642
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,270
She can't be released so easily.

643
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,030
Seriously, Uncle...

644
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,830
By chance,

645
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,700
could I visit that house?

646
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,340
Hello?

647
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,900
Why did you call?

648
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,690
I wanted to tell you something.

649
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,590
I'd like you to come to the office sometime.

650
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,210
Why tell me to come if you won't take the case?

651
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,770
I'm not going. I'm busy looking for another firm.

652
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,230
We never said we won't.

653
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,910
We just said there wasn't enough evidence.

654
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:45,390
Come out. It'd be worth hearing about.

655
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,600
How about around five later?

656
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,050
I'll see if I have time.

657
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,110
I'll see you later.

658
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,270
You can go in.

659
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,130
Aren't you coming in with me?

660
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,060
Well, we don't really want to.

661
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,870
Let me know when you're done.

662
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,700
December 31, Tuesday.

663
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,160
He's not responding at all.

664
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,350
My heart filled with tears.

665
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,310
He breathes harshly and rapidly.

666
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:32,650
December 27. His eyes are open
but not focused.

667
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,310
He doesn't respond to my voice.

668
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:38,170
I wish I lived just a day longer than Myeong Jae.

669
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,740
December 25.

670
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,460
When I called his name this morning,

671
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,100
he blinked and turned his head slightly.

672
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,360
His eyes looked clear for a brief moment.

673
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,260
He ate a bit of porridge and slept
for a long time as if he were tired.

674
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,920
December 28.

675
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,090
He flinched slightly when I held his hand.

676
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,850
I felt relieved because he looked peaceful.

677
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:03,150
December 30. I held his hand,
but he had no strength.

678
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,320
He's just receiving fluids.

679
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,030
What do I expect from keeping him alive?

680
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:13,120
Does he really want to live like this?

681
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,920
December 29. No response at all.

682
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,910
Almost impossible for him to swallow.

683
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,750
No one would listen to me.

684
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,870
No one is interested.

685
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,840
Oh, Ms. Jeong Sun Ja?

686
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,290
Since she didn't quite meet the requirement,

687
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,520
we could only provide minimal support.

688
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,640
It was hard to provide other care
since she has children.

689
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,290
But they apparently neglected her.

690
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,680
You could've provided care if you knew that.

691
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,340
We have our criteria, too.

692
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,940
We wish we could help everyone.

693
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,720
How has she been living, then?

694
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,650
I heard she got an insurance payout,

695
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,430
so she she lived off it and paid
Mr. Jeong's hospital fees, too.

696
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,720
Insurance payout?

697
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,670
Yes. She apparently signed up
for cancer insurance.

698
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,050
But she couldn't spend the money on her treatment.

699
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,490
I hear she's in a late stage.

700
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,930
Thank you.

701
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,210
You look really happy.

702
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,390
So do you.

703
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:54,260
Mr. Park should be the happy
one since he was right.

704
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,560
Is he not coming because he's upset?

705
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,020
You should've told him that we found a way.

706
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,940
Well, I wanted to tell him in person.

707
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,410
Will you not talk to me today, either?

708
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,340
I'll talk to you, then.

709
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:36,930
You had no choice but to care
for Mr. Jeong, who had no family.

710
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:44,230
You didn't want your children
to feel burdened by their uncle.

711
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,000
That's why you couldn't ask them for help.

712
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,690
Instead, you asked the government for help,

713
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,770
but since you didn't quite meet the requirements,

714
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:58,290
you could only get minimal support.

715
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,620
Ten years have passed like that,

716
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,290
and you started feeling afraid.

717
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:10,030
"What would happen to Myeong Jae
if I died before him?"

718
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,840
And you learned that you had cancer.

719
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,110
How did you...

720
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,650
find out all that?

721
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,670
I want to hear your story.

722
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,020
No one...

723
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,690
Not a single person listened to me.

724
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,980
The only solution was for me to endure.

725
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,160
I couldn't die before him.

726
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,870
When I...

727
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,950
learned that I had late-stage cancer,

728
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,540
do you know what I thought of first?

729
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,860
"I'll get insurance money.

730
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:22,700
We'll be okay for now, then."

731
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,220
I felt relieved first.

732
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,770
I could've died before him,

733
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:36,280
but I felt relieved first.

734
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:44,620
I prayed every day that I lived one day
longer than Myeong Jae,

735
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:50,200
but I couldn't leave it to Heaven anymore.

736
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,510
Heaven wants to take me away first.

737
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,920
Is that why you had no choice but to do that?

738
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,360
I don't want to say I had no choice.

739
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,040
How could you kill a person and...

740
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,960
say I had no choice but to do that?

741
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,400
But that's the story that brought you here.

742
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,940
You need to explain that in court.

743
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:28,410
I'll die soon, anyway.

744
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,540
I don't even need to ask for a lighter sentence.

745
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,480
I killed my little brother...

746
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,890
with my own hands.

747
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,870
How could I beg for forgiveness?

748
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,400
I'm too ashamed.

749
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:04,600
Then, only be punished for what you did.

750
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,720
Not all crimes come with the same punishment.

751
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,390
You only get punished for your sin.

752
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,090
And it's my job to explain it.

753
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,010
Please let me do my job.

754
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,500
The call is not going through.

755
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,100
You'll be connected to the
voicemail after the beep.

756
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,120
The call is not going through...

757
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,180
Therefore, the defendant

758
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,560
suffocated Mr. Jeong Myeong Jae,
which led to his death,

759
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,900
resulting in his murder.

760
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,740
Defense counsel, please state your opinion
on the facts of the indictment.

761
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,800
We admit to the charge and
acknowledge the evidence.

762
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,910
Got it. I'll look through the evidence, then.

763
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,730
I finished looking at the evidence.

764
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,890
Prosecutor, please request the sentence.

765
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:14,390
Please sentence the defendant
to 10 years in prison.

766
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,560
Defense counsel, please state your opinion.

767
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,590
I believe taking someone's life

768
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,610
is unforgivable in every way.

769
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,610
The defendant also agrees,
so she turned herself in

770
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:40,500
immediately, and she's been admitting the crime.

771
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,180
The defendant was the victim's only guardian.

772
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,170
The victim suffered from severe dementia

773
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:50,660
and she's been caring for him for over 10 years.

774
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,480
Without being able to get help
from her family and society,

775
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,420
she had to care for him and provide
for herself at the same time.

776
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,590
In that situation,

777
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:09,340
the defendant was diagnosed
with late-stage cancer recently.

778
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:24,420
Afraid that she'd depart even
a day before her brother,

779
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,820
she couldn't handle that possibility.

780
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,950
She doesn't seek a generous punishment.

781
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:36,340
But she wants to be punished
only for what she did.

782
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,370
Her crime was a result
of negligence, repeated isolation,

783
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,650
and prolonged exhaustion.

784
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:51,180
So, please consider her regretful attitude,

785
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,340
the circumstances that led to the case,

786
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,880
and her physical condition going forward.

787
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,990
I'm sorry, Mom.

788
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,780
Oh, no...

789
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,150
My gosh...

790
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,170
Have you been starving?

791
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:43,700
I eat too well. So, don't worry about it.

792
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,310
Right, Mom.

793
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:49,900
You didn't forget the checkup appointment, right?

794
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,410
I said I don't need stuff like that.

795
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,650
I said you need it.

796
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,360
Right. I found what you asked for.

797
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,260
It was in the corner of the wardrobe.

798
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,380
The scholarship certificate? Eat first.

799
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,820
Gosh, what's with her?

800
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,080
We got so many from all sorts of places.

801
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,170
I got this when I was in college.

802
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,250
I got this and this in college, too.

803
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:43,600
Yes, I got this livelihood support
when I was in law school.

804
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,640
The name was "Seed Scholarship Foundation." Right.

805
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,780
What?

806
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,530
Let's eat. Eat, Mom.

807
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,180
Hello.

808
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,270
Hello. Good morning.

809
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:28,050
Attorney Cho, Mr. Seong asked you
to come to this office first thing.

810
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,090
Oh, okay.

811
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,290
Come on in.

812
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,390
Did you want to see me, Mr. Seong?

813
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,310
Yes. You know him, right? It's Director Jang.

814
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:43,120
Long time no see.

815
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:48,640
Hello.

816
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,540
Have a seat.

817
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,380
He came to give you a case.

818
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:59,500
I got into a car accident
after drinking a tiny bit.

819
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,560
I'm in your care.

820
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,910
You're my personal attorney.

821
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,140
Hello, sir.

822
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,070
Gosh, wait, wait, wait.

823
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,130
Wait, wait.

824
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,740
Attorney Ha, you just arrived.

825
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:27,260
Well, yes. Hello.

826
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,980
Good morning.

827
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,630
Yes.

828
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,560
He apparently hit someone lightly.

829
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,590
It wasn't a serious accident. It won't be hard.

830
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,170
You're telling me to take the case, right?

831
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,640
Of course, you should.

832
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,630
Director Jang brought the case to you.

833
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,000
I won't take it.

834
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
- What?
- I said I don't want to.

835
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,420
What do you mean? You want me to take it?

836
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,080
You can take it or...

837
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,440
tell him to find another attorney somewhere else.

838
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,620
Do as you wish.

839
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:21,490
You're acting as if you're the partner.

840
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,380
We can't work together if you're like this.

841
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,540
Right. We won't be working together.

842
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,840
I quit. Find another associate attorney.

843
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,260
Yes.

844
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,200
- You came in early.
- Yeah.

845
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:01,870
- Well, the thing is-
- Mr. Park won't answer your call, right?

846
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,250
I tried calling him many times, too.

847
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:09,390
Should we visit him after work?

848
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,670
Sure.

849
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,740
Hello?

850
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,050

They're doing a tax audit on us.

Only we're in the hot seat now.
