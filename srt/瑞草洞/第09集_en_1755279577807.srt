2
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,220
Hey, aren't you getting up?

3
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm off... I'm off today.

4
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,110
- I'll get you soup.
- It's okay. I'll just eat this.

5
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,120
They say it's better to eat warm food. Wait.

6
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,340
What's all that?

7
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,320
Oh, they're gifts from the nurse's office.

8
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,190
Should we see what we have?

9
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,040
Let's see. This is...

10
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,520
Baby clothes. They're so pretty.

11
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
This is...

12
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,700
moisturizing lotion and stretch mark ointment.

13
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,770
That's my fourth ointment.

14
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,890
The more the better.

15
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,790
Do they think I'll get stretch marks?

16
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,210
I might not.

17
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,900
They say everyone's different.

18
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,440
You might get them since everyone's different.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,980
What's this?

20
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,110
They're so pretty.

21
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,350
They say the oldest girl resembles her dad.

22
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,400
- I know.
- She'll be so pretty.

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,410
Let's see.

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,520
Have you asked about maternity leave?

25
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,080
Just wait a bit.

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,010
I'm not sure if I can be on maternity leave at all.

27
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,090
What? Who doesn't give maternity leave these days?

28
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,480
How would I know? They said no.

29
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,280
So?

30
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,790
So, did you say, "Okay" and leave?

31
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,250
What should I have said, then?

32
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,480
Should I have said, "I'll quit"?

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,840
No, that's not what I meant.

34
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,770
Don't get angry. The baby can hear you.

35
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,690
When did I get angry?

36
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,010
So annoying.

37
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,640
Mun Jeong, Mun Jeong, e-eat...

38
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
How many cases are you handling right now?

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,810
About 50.

40
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,900
What do we do with those?

41
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,070
Should Attorney An and I split them 25 each?

42
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,170
When we already have 50 each?

43
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,790
It's not easy to hire a temporary attorney for just three or six months.

44
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,780
You know clients don't like it when their attorney keeps changing.

45
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,070
But this is my legal right.

46
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,870
I know it's your right, Attorney Bae.

47
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,640
What?

48
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,630
Use a new one.

49
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,250
Here.

50
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,350
I picked it up.

51
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,960
- See you.
- Bye.

52
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,140
Yes.

53
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,930
Attorney Ha, you have a package.

54
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,250
- Package?
- I think it's from the interns.

55
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,260
Oh, okay. Thank you.

56
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,630
Attorney Ha Sang Ki, thank you for being such a great teacher.

57
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,110
We'll learn more and become good attorneys.

58
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,300
- Park Do Hyeon.
- Kim Ha Na.

59
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,730
- Gong Min Jun.
- Yu Hae Yeon.

60
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,540
Sincerely.

61
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,230
- Is this no good?
- I don't know why I'm so difficult.

62
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,910
We should've gone somewhere else.

63
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,360
No, no. Eat, eat.

64
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,340
Hey, it's a boy. It's a boy.

65
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,470
My mom said sons make you sick a lot.

66
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,890
She knows from experience.

67
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,900
It's a girl.

68
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,350
- What? It's a girl?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,820
- Congrats, Unni.
- Thanks.

70
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,840
What did he say about maternity leave?

71
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,670
Of course, he said no.

72
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,100
What do associate attorneys from other firms do?

73
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,560
I don't know. I've always been the only one.

74
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,860
Me, too.

75
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,050
Your firm's managing partner is a woman.

76
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,890
What did she do when she had a baby?

77
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,500
She's not married, okay?

78
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,990
Oh, really? How about yours, Hui Ji?

79
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,430
I'm not so sure, either.

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,300
Would a female managing partner be more understanding about it?

81
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,920
Isn't that too much? Of course, they should let you.

82
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
You know how they are.

83
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,140
We're hopeless without each other since we're so small.

84
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,230
But there are at least you and Ju Hyeong, two people.

85
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,870
Right.

86
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm okay. Feel free to go on it.

87
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,540
Join our firm, Unni. Our managing partner isn't like that.

88
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,180
Gosh, I know.

89
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,720
Ask her to hire me as soon as a position opens up.

90
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,690
What's this?

91
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,160
This? Well...

92
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,600
Didn't you receive it?

93
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,120
What is it? What is it? Where did you get it?

94
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,490
N-No... N-Never mind.

95
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,450
No, never mind.

96
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,780
- What is it?
- What is it?

97
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,360
- It's nothing. Nothing.
- You have a girlfriend, don't you?

98
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,060
- This is so good.
- Oppa, why are your ears so red?

99
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,290
Hey.

100
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,360
Did you have lunch?

101
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,740
Yes, I did.

102
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,960
Ms. Kang.

103
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,900
Yes?

104
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,900
How can we go on maternity leave if we get pregnant?

105
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,760
Are you getting married, Attorney An?

106
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,600
No, I was just curious.

107
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,320
Gosh, I thought you were.

108
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,020
I know what you're supposed to do legally,

109
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,270
but it's hard to actually provide it.

110
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,030
Since we only have one associate attorney.

111
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,180
Yes, I suppose.

112
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,560
You're sure you aren't getting married, right?

113
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,700
I really am not.

114
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,600
What a shame. I thought we were about to celebrate.

115
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,350
See you.

116
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,850
Attorney Bae, I just sent you an email.

117
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,480
Kori Tech is starting a business, and they want us to check for legal risks.

118
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,060
Please write them what you think.

119
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,170
Okay, got it.

120
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,900
Consulting is no fun.

121
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,520
Did Attorney An go somewhere? He's not at his desk.

122
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm not sure. What is it about?

123
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,080
Well, we have a lawsuit.

124
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,200
Let me do that instead.

125
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,760
The client isn't able to come. They asked us to come to them.

126
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,010
- So?
- You had a lot to think about yesterday.

127
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,990
Isn't consulting easier than a lawsuit now?

128
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,580
You just need to sit and write.

129
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm being considerate since you're pregnant.

130
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,850
It's okay. I'll do it.

131
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,870
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

132
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,550
Unni, step out for a second.

133
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,600
Unni, I got you bread.

134
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,860
You didn't get to eat earlier.

135
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,340
Wow, thank you.

136
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,900
And this is decaf coffee.

137
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,270
Is it true you can drink this?

138
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,360
Yes. So important to me.

139
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,610
Do you want to get tteokbokki with me later?

140
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,100
- I can eat it.
- Gosh, what a relief.

141
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,780
I'm so grateful. Geez.

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,490
It's so tasty. Especially this sauce.

143
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,960
They're apparently super famous.

144
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,000
But they don't look busy today.

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,710
That's why we're here today.

146
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,120
Did you enjoy it?

147
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,250
I wanted to get a patent for this sauce,

148
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,340
but it didn't work out.

149
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,720
They deliberated for a long time,

150
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,580
but they said it's not good enough to get a patent.

151
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,390
Did he work here for a long time?

152
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,760
He was here for a little over two years.

153
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,390
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

154
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,000
I originally hired him as a server,

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,240
but from the get-go, he wanted to learn in the kitchen, too.

156
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,360
So, I put him in the kitchen

157
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,260
and taught him how to make tteokbokki.

158
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
But he suddenly quit one day

159
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,810
and started a shop exactly like ours.

160
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,590
Did you try his food?

161
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,310
I thought I'd get angry if I saw him.

162
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,750
So, someone picked it up for me to try.

163
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,460
It tasted exactly the same.

164
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,270
That's why you think you're getting less business, right?

165
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,430
Ever since they opened,

166
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,980
our sales have dropped by half.

167
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,860
We've always had many regulars.

168
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,950
Many visited us from far away,

169
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,060
but I guess their location is better.

170
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,520
They don't come all the way here.

171
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,250
Thank you.

172
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,890
Because she failed to get a patent,

173
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,910
he quit immediately, thinking he could copy.

174
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,730
How shameless.

175
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,310
Are you full?

176
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,970
A little.

177
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,030
Let's do another round.

178
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,960
Do you need anything else?

179
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,840
Welcome.

180
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,810
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

181
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,020
This really is exactly the same.

182
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,950
You can say they opened a second branch.

183
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,450
Unni, it must be him.

184
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,540
Can you eat it?

185
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,100
Of course, I can.

186
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,300
- Because it tastes the same.
- That's right.

187
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,270
Yes, yes. Got it.

188
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,250
Is the food to your liking?

189
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,650
- Well, yes.
- Feel free to take photos

190
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,180
and spread the word.

191
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,490
Okay. It's delicious.

192
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm full.

193
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,900
As far as I know, the lawsuits for copying recipes

194
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,470
have rarely won.

195
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,610
Right. And she failed to get a patent.

196
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,030
He'll probably say there's no issue using that fact.

197
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,360
Failing to get a patent doesn't mean it's okay to steal.

198
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,390
So, how can you get the court to recognize that?

199
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,820
We can ask all the reasons, then.

200
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,300
Why they didn't get the patent.

201
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,200
♫  What would it be like afterward?  ♫

202
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,050
♫  If I stopped, would you try to leave far away?  ♫

203
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,690
♫  I have an old secret  ♫

204
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,700
♫  I've never talked about it  ♫

205
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,320
♫  To be honest, I don't know what I like  ♫

206
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:34,210
♫  Or where I'm supposed to go now  ♫

207
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,600
♫  According to the flow  ♫

208
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,630
♫  According to the wind  ♫

209
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,100
I'm so upset.

210
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,680
Our filling is different from other places.

211
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,580
Ours have uncrushed beans.

212
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,640
This makes the filling taste sweeter.

213
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,360
Our customers come here because of this.

214
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,960
♫  Even the joy I've never had  ♫

215
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,720
♫  Sometimes, I feel so good  ♫

216
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,070
♫  I like being with people  ♫

217
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,450
♫  I come up with things to do  ♫

218
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:45,390
♫  On some days, I have no confidence at all  ♫

219
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,700
♫  According to the flow  ♫

220
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,140
♫  I want to spend my entire day  ♫

221
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,520
♫  I want to know myself and tell you  ♫

222
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,300
♫  About where I'm headed to  ♫

223
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,460
♫  I want to meet you now and tell you  ♫

224
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,160
♫  The things I can't talk about  ♫

225
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,000
- Ma'am.
- What brings you here without notice?

226
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,070
Can I see the kitchen again?

227
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,950
This recipe isn't protected by a patent.

228
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,890
There's no issue with using it at all.

229
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,220
Even a recipe that couldn't be patented

230
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,030
can be protected if it's a trade secret.

231
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,660
Please display Evidence No. 4.

232
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,650
The reason the recipe case victims can rarely win is

233
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,630
because the law doesn't recognize their recipes as trade secrets.

234
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,540
It's because they weren't being treated as secrets.

235
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,539
Please display Evidence No. 5.

236
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:06,560
The recipe would've been acknowledged if it were treated like a secret.

237
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,740
But most restaurants don't take any protective measures.

238
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,460
But if you look at the plaintiff, Jeong Hyeon Ju's shop,

239
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,390
she installed a lock for the sauce mixing room

240
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,050
and she told the passcode to only a few kitchen staff.

241
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,500
Because the defendant, Oh Jeong Wuk, was one of the kitchen staff,

242
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,320
he learned this recipe.

243
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,930
Therefore, this recipe is considered a trade secret.

244
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,760
Even if it was treated as a secret,

245
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,590
it can't be protected as a trade secret.

246
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,700
Its non-publicity and profitability need to be recognized, too.

247
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,510
Non-publicity means it's never been made public

248
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,140
and the plaintiff is the only source of it.

249
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,120
But since she protected it as such, it has to be recognized.

250
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,060
Yes, it seems that way.

251
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,250
But its profitability was never proven.

252
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,900
After the defendant opened his shop,

253
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,470
the plaintiff's sales dropped by half.

254
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,430
The defendant took away the plaintiff's regulars using nothing but this recipe.

255
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,720
That alone proves the recipe's profitability.

256
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,420
That has never been proven.

257
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,410
Plaintiff's counsel, please submit the documents.

258
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,670
Yes, Your Honor.

259
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,330
Here. Thank you.

260
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,010
Sure.

261
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,710
And Executive Director, well...

262
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,530
you know Lee Dong Su from the first year?

263
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,010
What is it this time?

264
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,050
By investing in small business owners' start-up funds,

265
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,740
he's making the conditions very favorable to him.

266
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,530
When they complained about it later,

267
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,650
he said he'd sue to get the investment fund back.

268
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,060
That means he hasn't sued yet.

269
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,670
That's correct.

270
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,180
I'll try meeting with him.

271
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,420
- You mean, the victim?
- Yes.

272
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,830
Lee Dong Su, too.

273
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,370
When you opened the barbecue shop, Lee Dong Su invested 100 million

274
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,950
under the condition of taking four million in profit each month.

275
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,510
Yes, I've been paying him four million for over five years.

276
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,540
Regardless of whether the shop was in profit or deficit?

277
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,100
Yes.

278
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,500
The condition is too unfavorable for you.

279
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,000
I've never seen an investment method like this.

280
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,090
I couldn't pay him for the first time since I've been struggling,

281
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,080
and he said he'd sue me to get all the investment fund back.

282
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,030
I agreed to return the original investment if I couldn't keep the promise.

283
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,370
Has Mr. Lee inserted himself in the business at all?

284
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,980
No, not at all.

285
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,480
I need to return the investment fund. I will,

286
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,040
but I'd like to know if I can delay it at least.

287
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,190
This is going to kill me. Please help me.

288
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,470
Yes, I'll try to find the best solution possible.

289
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,430
Thank you.

290
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,790
Attorney, as for the consultation fee—

291
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,620
Well, I'm not an attorney.

292
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,840
I'm trying to help since I know about business and investments.

293
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,530
There will be no consultation fee.

294
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,360
You don't have to worry.

295
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,300
Thank you. Thank you so much.

296
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,010
An Italian BMT on honey oat bread.

297
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,010
Try what I ordered. It's tasty.

298
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,540
- Okay.
- One more of the same.

299
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,160
No bell pepper. No bell pepper, please.

300
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,630
I'll have a 30cm Egg Mayo, the Sub Pick.

301
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,270
I'll have the same. I'll have a cookie, too.

302
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,330
Everything, please. Everything.

303
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,250
How is it? Isn't it good?

304
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,680
Yes, it's good.

305
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,630
I love it with avocado.

306
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,680
I like Egg Mayo.

307
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,060
This is when lawsuits get fun.

308
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,690
When you attack the opponent unexpectedly

309
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,930
like this and shock them.

310
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,090
But isn't submitting the evidence the same day too much?

311
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,580
You have to do that to make it fun.

312
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,030
Right. This is a technique, too.

313
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,090
Sang Ki, you should learn.

314
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,690
Don't try to be so proper all the time.

315
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,090
You always win if you have sound logic, jerk.

316
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,140
Okay, okay, Professor. Geez.

317
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,990
You were so tenacious, by the way.

318
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,600
I should learn from you instead of Ju Hyeong from now on.

319
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,140
- Yes.
- I taught her all this.

320
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,250
You can't help what you didn't expect,

321
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,130
but you need to try everything you're suspicious of.

322
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,440
I dug deeper to improve it and

323
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,160
turned it into tenaciousness.

324
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,610
How ungrateful of you.

325
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,100
Did the owner send the sales document?

326
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,490
Yes. I already submitted it to prove that her sales dropped by half.

327
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,090
It's over now. Case closed.

328
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,660
Let's start writing the first draft with this now, then.

329
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,770
- Yes, Ms. Kim.
- Okay.

330
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,460
Well, Attorney Ha.

331
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,680
Yes.

332
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,480
This...

333
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,570
What's this?

334
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,380
You went to Gwangseong University, right?

335
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,390
It's the admission info on their doctoral program.

336
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,500
But why...

337
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,000
Try getting a doctoral degree just in case.

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,310
You need one if you want to teach later.

339
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,400
No, I'm not interested in doing that.

340
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,540
It won't hurt to get one.

341
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,510
I know you like debating and studying.

342
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,940
I can give a bit of support if you keep working for us, too.

343
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,030
Think about it.

344
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,850
Okay.

345
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,300
You shouldn't pursue that lawsuit.

346
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,860
Did you call me to tell me that?

347
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,260
Even if you made the contract favorable to you,

348
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,500
it's better to yield and leave in terms of business.

349
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,730
You weren't so soft running your business, either.

350
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,330
I'm telling you from my experience.

351
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,400
You need to use people and

352
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,300
leave them happy for your business to do better.

353
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,560
No, no, no.

354
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,790
You need to invest well and

355
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,690
have good profit. That makes it good.

356
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,580
What right do you have to do this?

357
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,050
I'm doing this because of my responsibility, not right.

358
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,200
You weren't like this when I first met you.

359
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
How much longer will you live like this?

360
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,390
Why do you care if I live this way or not?

361
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,040
Just get an attorney as usual.

362
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,780
Don't pretend you suddenly care.

363
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,230
Yes, all the investment contracts so far.

364
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,650
Yes. Please bring it whenever you acquire it.

365
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,030
Okay, thank you.

366
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,600
Yes.

367
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,540
Attorney Ha, are you busy?

368
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,240
Ms. Kim, what brings you here?

369
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,900
I wanted to consult you on something.

370
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,620
Are you free right now?

371
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,580
I'm so sorry.

372
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,810
An urgent arrest review came up for tomorrow.

373
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,550
Right now, it might be difficult.

374
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,490
Okay. I'll ask someone else.

375
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,400
Wait...

376
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,360
Do you want to ask Attorney An Ju Hyeong?

377
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,400
If he doesn't know, no one in the building would know.

378
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,690
Okay, I will.

379
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,730
I'm sorry. I should be helping you.

380
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm really okay, Attorney Ha.

381
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,640
By the way, are you getting a doctoral degree?

382
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,240
Oh, this? No, I'm not.

383
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,510
I took a quick look because Ms. Kim gave it to me.

384
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,860
I recommend it. Highly recommend it.

385
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,990
It suits you perfectly. Give it a try.

386
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,280
Not at all.

387
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,730
Oh, come on.

388
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,530
Attorney Ha, fighting.

389
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,160
Civil Law Article 104 would also be difficult, right?

390
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,940
He used his desperate situation and lack of experience

391
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,540
and created an unjust contract. So, it's invalid.

392
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,160
Well, I don't think Article 104 applies to this.

393
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,210
This hardly gets acknowledged

394
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,870
and it's not illegal to demand the original investment, either.

395
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm trying to figure out a solution,

396
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,090
but it's not easy.

397
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,780
I think this would be easier than it seems.

398
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,390
How so?

399
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,540
It says, "Investment Contract" here.

400
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,870
But try ignoring the word "investment."

401
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,720
It's an investment contract, but ignore the word "investment"?

402
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,160
Yes. Only think about what he's promising in the contract.

403
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,860
He just lent money and took interest.

404
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,240
It's a loan?

405
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,710
Yes. This isn't an investment contract.

406
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,310
It says that in the title, but he lent 100 million

407
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,540
and took four million each month.

408
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,900
If you think of it as a loan,

409
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,590
you still need to pay it back.

410
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,970
He still needs to return 100 million.

411
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,050
If you think of it as a loan, the Interest Limitation Act applies.

412
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,370
It only allows you to charge up to 20% in interest per year.

413
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,500
But he took four million in interest each month.

414
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,690
He exceeded the limit way too much.

415
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,230
Since he's been exceeding the limit for five years,

416
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,420
the victim probably paid off the original loan a while ago.

417
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,070
That means Lee Dong Su actually owes Mr. Go money.

418
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,850
Yes. Lee Dong Su shouldn't be filing the lawsuit.

419
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,480
Mr. Go is the one who should be suing.

420
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,120
To demand the overpaid amount.

421
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,310
- Wow.
- Do you need anything else?

422
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,610
No. This is more than enough.

423
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,150
Wow.

424
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,750
The plaintiff submitted the sales report.

425
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,040
Defense counsel, do you have an opinion on this?

426
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,890
The plaintiff's counsel said the recipe qualifies as a trade secret,

427
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,050
but the non-publicity aspect, which means it was never revealed

428
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,030
and it's only accessible through the plaintiff, is not satisfied.

429
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,340
Like I mentioned before,

430
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,600
she was protecting it with a lock—

431
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,780
Please display Evidence No. 5.

432
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,380
This is a patent notice.

433
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,950
The plaintiff requested a patent but was rejected.

434
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,370
After a year and a half has passed,

435
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,820
the patent request becomes public.

436
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,810
So, the plaintiff's recipe is no longer

437
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,380
a secret that's never been revealed.

438
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,660
I wanted to get a patent for this sauce,

439
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,690
but it didn't work out.

440
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,120
They deliberated for a long time,

441
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,510
but they said it's not good enough to get a patent.

442
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,690
You're right.

443
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,350
It no longer meets the non-publicity criteria.

444
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,480
Plaintiff's counsel, will you keep insisting it's a trade secret?

445
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,720
I'll look into this.

446
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,770
The plaintiff's recipe was

447
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,330
denied a patent because it was nothing new.

448
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,680
Anyone who worked at the shop could've learned it easily

449
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,230
and it's not a trade secret since this is public.

450
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,470
Plaintiff's counsel, look into this and respond.

451
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,960
We'll end the trial at the next hearing if nothing else comes up.

452
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,680
Yes, Your Honor.

453
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,770
Is it okay to work this late?

454
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,160
Whatever. I can do it.

455
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,110
Here. Ji Seok asked me to care for you.

456
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,570
Why did you fight this time?

457
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,030
How much do you know, exactly?

458
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,040
Do you need help? So, you can go home?

459
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,320
Yes, please.

460
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,170
The recipe has no meaning anymore, then.

461
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,960
Yes. The recipe is public now.

462
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,630
Gosh, isn't there a way?

463
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,520
How do you think you would've felt?

464
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,180
I would've been totally pissed.

465
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,800
He took all the customers, and the sales dropped by half.

466
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,630
What if you were a customer?

467
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,790
You like top-rated restaurants.

468
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,010
How would you feel if a shop exactly like your favorite opened?

469
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,210
I'd never go if I were a customer.

470
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,590
I need to be loyal.

471
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,740
You said it tastes the same.

472
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,260
You don't go to a favorite spot just because of the food taste.

473
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,290
The owner's knowledge, the familiar interior,

474
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,520
and the shop's unique atmosphere.

475
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,580
Stuff like that comforts you.

476
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,600
You said all of that is the same.

477
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,880
Yes.

478
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,970
Wow.

479
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,960
I know.

480
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,730
Hey, I-I need to go.

481
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,410
Bye.

482
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,050
The fact that you requested a patent is actually hurting you.

483
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,420
I know.

484
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,600
I wanted to get a patent initially

485
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,930
because I wanted to be acknowledged that

486
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,880
I created this flavor.

487
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,820
But that's not letting me get the recognition.

488
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,810
Did Mr. Oh know you were denied a patent?

489
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,670
Yes. It was when he had just started the job.

490
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,230
He suggested it out of the blue.

491
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,830
That I should get a patent since it's so delicious.

492
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,620
So, I told him that I tried, but it didn't work out.

493
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,640
Sounds like he wanted to find out if it was patented or not.

494
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,920
You mean he asked on purpose?

495
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,240
Was he trying to steal it from the beginning?

496
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,190
He didn't just steal the flavor.

497
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,550
He stole the shop's atmosphere and interior design.

498
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,910
It's reasonable to say he intended to from the get-go.

499
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,400
True. The interior design studio owner thought

500
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,410
I was opening a new branch.

501
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,800
Do you know the interior design studio owner?

502
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,240
He's one of our regulars.

503
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,580
Since we didn't put any work into the interior,

504
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,630
we fixed things as they broke

505
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,060
and changed things up a bit through him.

506
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,960
But I guess Oh Jeong Wuk hired him to do their interior.

507
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,060
The recipe...

508
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,050
and this shop.

509
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,700
For the last 20 years,

510
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,300
I've been creating them bit by bit.

511
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,290
These chairs,

512
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,010
those bowls,

513
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,370
and every single thing...

514
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,760
was chosen very carefully.

515
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,350
That's how this place came to be.

516
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,640
But people probably don't know.

517
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,430
Since the food and ambiance must be the same.

518
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,150
Working here was so fun.

519
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,390
But I no longer feel that way.

520
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,950
It makes me sad.

521
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,500
Let's bring back your joy.

522
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,080
Give me the interior design studio's contact info.

523
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,410
Senior, you're going home now?

524
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,270
- Yes, you, too?
- Yes.

525
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,900
What's that? Are you going to school?

526
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,910
No, no. It's nothing.

527
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:39,190
My managing partner suddenly asked if I was interested in a doctoral program.

528
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,740
She suddenly gave it to me.

529
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,020
I see. Are you interested?

530
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,170
No.

531
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,950
But people keep saying it suits me, and I should check it out.

532
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,040
It sounds easy, but it costs a fortune.

533
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,800
But you want to do it?

534
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
Huh?

535
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,940
Well, kind of.

536
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,920
- Huh?
- Huh?

537
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,260
Well, you know...

538
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,280
I want to.

539
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,150
Let's go, Senior.

540
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,040
Yes, thank you.

541
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,510
Are you ready?

542
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,310
Yes.

543
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,040
Please start the presentation.

544
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,500
As you can see, the plaintiff and the defendant's food

545
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,060
look and taste the same.

546
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,600
The employees' uniform design is the same.

547
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,520
And the shop has the same decoration, too.

548
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,940
They happened to use products with similar designs and colors.

549
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,800
The decorations aren't unique to the plaintiff's shop.

550
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,820
They're ordinary things that you can see in other shops, too.

551
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,780
Yes, that's correct. That is the key point.

552
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,770
As the defendant pointed out earlier,

553
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,140
the plaintiff's recipe has no patent

554
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,530
and it's not legally a trade secret.

555
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,080
The employees' uniforms and interior design aren't special.

556
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,100
You could call the theme ordinary.

557
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,270
When Defendant Oh Jeong Wuk was preparing to open a tteokbokki shop,

558
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,730
he submitted this inquiry to an interior design studio.

559
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,960
And the photos of the plaintiff's shop are next to it.

560
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,970
The request the defendant made

561
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:52,330
is an exact description of the plaintiff's shop.

562
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,580
If the decoration was nothing special, as the defense said,

563
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,350
why did he make such specific requests like that?

564
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,010
I'm so happy a branch opened near me.

565
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,440
I loved the food from the original location,

566
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,750
but the new branch also...

567
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,740
I hope more branches open up.

568
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,880
Flavors created through long research.

569
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,040
The employees' attitude, attire, and the ambiance

570
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,510
that reflects the experience of running a shop.

571
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,730
All of those components make up the plaintiff's shop.

572
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,250
It's a result she got with extensive investment and effort.

573
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,490
The defendant got a job there as a server, acquired her knowledge,

574
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,110
and inquired whether she had a patent or not.

575
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,200
After he found out the patent was denied,

576
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,090
he coaxed the recipe out of the plaintiff

577
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,300
and opened his shop, which looks like a branch.

578
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,760
- This is mere speculation.
- It doesn't matter

579
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,290
when he planned this on purpose.

580
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,000
What's clear is that without the plaintiff's shop,

581
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,030
the defendant's shop would not exist.

582
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,360
The plaintiff's shop represents her personal history and identity over time.

583
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,060
Not only did he steal it without permission,

584
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,070
but he tried to make a profit by making it appear as a branch.

585
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,690
The recipe wasn't patented, and it's not a trade secret.

586
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,170
But this is a violation of the Unfair Competition Prevention Law.

587
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,100
The defendant is responsible for compensating for the loss

588
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,940
and he should be banned from running the shop and using the recipe.

589
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,060
Okay.

590
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,900
Defense counsel,

591
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,230
do you have a response?

592
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,110
I do not.

593
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,360
­  -

594
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
You're applying to a doctoral program?

595
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,600
Yes, I want to give it a shot.

596
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,040
That's why I came for your advice, Professor.

597
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,440
I'd be happy to help.

598
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,660
But why all of a sudden?

599
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,050
You graduated a while ago.

600
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,000
Well, I want to study a bit more.

601
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,330
I want to teach when I get a chance, too.

602
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:48,060
I see. You want to become a professor?

603
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,810
Yes, not right now.

604
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,540
I'd like to consider it while studying.

605
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,580
What will you do with your job once you start the program?

606
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,140
I should keep working.

607
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,240
I need to pay the rent, Professor.

608
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,630
That's why I'm thinking of taking night classes.

609
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,510
If you're studying more to get a doctor's degree,

610
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,340
it wouldn't matter.

611
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,510
But it won't be good if you're thinking of becoming a professor.

612
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:32,890
We prioritize teaching opportunities for full-time students.

613
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,280
We think that's better than the one who also worked.

614
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh, yes. I can see that.

615
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,110
Haven't you been saving up while working?

616
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,090
Yes, I suppose I have.

617
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,340
Yes, Professor. Take care.

618
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,070
Think carefully if you want to come back to school full time.

619
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,800
If not, you can work while pursuing the degree.

620
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,680
Huh? Ma'am.

621
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,010
My mom.

622
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,810
- What brings you here?
- Is my mom...

623
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,460
I switched with her because she was feeling ill today.

624
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,700
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

625
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,020
She's sick? Got it.

626
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,000
Okay, bye.

627
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,160
Mom.

628
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,480
Sang Ki, you came.

629
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,190
What brings you here without a call?

630
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,760
Mom, are you sick?

631
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,740
I'm not sick at all.

632
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,630
I took a day off because my head hurt.

633
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,520
Your head hurts?

634
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,760
Since when?

635
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,610
It happens when you're old.

636
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,790
When did you get a health checkup, Mom?

637
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,550
It'd be scarier if they said I had a serious illness.

638
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,620
You have to be treated, then. What are you saying?

639
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,050
It's okay.

640
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,600
It's just a headache.

641
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,900
- I have money.
- I have money, too.

642
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,200
- Get a checkup, then.
- So noisy.

643
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,920
Forget it.

644
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,710
I'll get you porridge.

645
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,990
Stay under the covers.

646
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,220
Let's go, Attorney Bae.

647
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,730
Yes.

648
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,360
You did so much. Eat before you go.

649
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,920
I appreciate it, but I need to get back early.

650
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,920
I'd feel terrible, then. How can I...

651
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,300
I'll stop by sometime.

652
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,310
Customers will line up soon.

653
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,640
I should visit you before then.

654
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,270
I'll get you a table whenever you come.

655
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,630
Thank you.

656
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,480
I should be thanking you.

657
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,530
I can have fun working again, thanks to you.

658
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,240
I really love my job.

659
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,490
Me, too.

660
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,550
You came. You haven't had dinner, right? Let's eat.

661
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,710
What are these?

662
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,720
Your legs seem to have swollen lately.

663
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,080
So, I got a pair in a bigger size.

664
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,300
They fit well.

665
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,140
I'm sorry.

666
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,170
No, why are you sorry? I'm sorry.

667
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,680
Well...

668
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,460
Can I think about it a bit more?

669
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,650
About what?

670
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,070
I enjoy my job too much.

671
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,140
I enjoy trials way too much.

672
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,860
Giving birth and parenting...

673
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,520
I don't know what will happen with that yet.

674
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,320
But I'll think about it while working for now.

675
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,140
Mun Jeong,

676
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:00,250
take your time thinking about it

677
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,750
and do whatever you want to do.

678
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:08,030
I can cater to any decisions you make.

679
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,690
It must've been hard for you.

680
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,220
Why would you come all the way here?

681
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,400
We could've met in court.

682
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,140
I wanted to tell you this.

683
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,950
You supposedly invested in Mr. Go's business,

684
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,990
but you're basically charging interest for a loan.

685
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,770
That's not the same.

686
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,490
I clearly agreed to invest.

687
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,660
Calling it that doesn't make it an investment.

688
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,390
That's considered a loan legally.

689
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,390
Since you work with money,

690
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,960
you must know what the Interest Limitation Act is.

691
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,700
You won't be getting investment money back from him.

692
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,500
You need to give him tens of millions back.

693
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,440
Are you an attorney, Executive Director?

694
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,380
It's funny that you're bringing up the law with me.

695
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,520
Are you confused because you have an office

696
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,620
at a law firm?

697
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:22,650
Do the right thing if you don't want to see me again.

698
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,880
I won't give up on stopping you.

699
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,320
Geez. I'm so sick of this.

700
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,440
What do you want to eat?

701
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,500
Fried chicken?

702
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,890
- Fried chicken, it is.
- Hello.

703
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,310
You haven't left yet.

704
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,610
I should get going now.

705
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,550
You helped me resolve the case I mentioned before.

706
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,660
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

707
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,890
All I did was make a few comments.

708
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,920
Those few comments saved someone.

709
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,390
- See you.
- Bye.

710
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,340
Did you help her with something?

711
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,760
It was just something simple.

712
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,890
Are we going to the same place?

713
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,530
No, let's get gopchang.

714
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,100
I suddenly crave something spicy.

715
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,570
Gopchang all of a sudden?

716
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,800
You don't want it?

717
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,490
I do.

718
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,770
Regardless of the duration and no matter how much you put in,

719
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,920
you can get interest every day?

720
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,170
Yes, that's correct.

721
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,490
You can deposit and withdraw whenever, too.

722
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:32,400
It's useful for saving up.

723
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,100
I see.

724
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,550
I just need to be able to deposit freely.

725
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,530
I won't be spending money for a while.

726
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,840
Should I help you open the account, then?

727
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,120
Yes, yes. Deposit all of this in there.

728
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,810
Yes, sir.

729
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,460
The account was created.

730
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,880
Can I get going now?

731
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,270
Just one moment.

732
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,410
Here. Take these plushies.

733
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,990
I'm headed to jail now.

734
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,960
I'll come out after I pay my dues.

735
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,970
Thank you, Attorney.

736
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,960
You must've been upset last time.

737
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,750
Well, you know.

738
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,180
But lobster and ham are quite different in value.

739
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,000
But it's okay.

740
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,100
Well, I was referring to cases.

741
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,720
Because I gave them to others.

742
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,080
I wanted to see you today because I wanted you to take on a case.

743
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,230
Gosh, sounds good.

744
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,200
It's about time we get one.

745
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,350
We welcome any case. Attorney Jo is good.

746
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,370
Yes. It's in your care.

747
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,460
What kind of case is it?

748
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,750
It's an attempted murder case.

749
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,550
Hey, come here.

750
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,370
How far will you go? Come here, I said.

751
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,820
Hey, hey.

752
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,110
F***er, did you think transferring would be the end of it?

753
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,460
I have nowhere to go because you got me expelled from school.

754
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,830
What will you do?

755
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,890
What will you do? Shit.

756
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,810
My life is over because of you.

757
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,250
Are you happy? Are you?

758
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,490
What will you do?

759
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,710
Stab me. Stab me.

760
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,830
Stab me. Stab me, I said.

761
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:02,640
Hey, stab me. Stab me.

762
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,980
Chan Yeong,

763
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,650
where did you get the knife?

764
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,400
It was his.

765
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,910
Did you take his knife?

766
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,260
Does that count as taking it from him?

767
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:52,700
Feel free to tell me what happened that day.

768
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,000
- Attorney.
- Yes.

769
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,220
Why are they not arresting me?

770
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,310
The situation itself isn't complicated,

771
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,690
but it kind of bothers me.

772
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,350
He should accept the charge

773
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,580
and get extenuation.

774
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,200
Huh? You won't even try to get him acquitted?

775
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,470
Acquittal?

776
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,900
- Yes.
- That's reaching.

777
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,130
He still stabbed him.

778
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:28,510
There are records of him getting bullied and transferring.

779
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,370
I'll ask to consider mitigating factors and get the most generous sentence.

780
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,290
I think you can go for self-defense.

781
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,540
Self-defense?

782
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,530
Hey. F***er.

783
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,990
Did you think transferring would be the end of it?

784
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:45,380
I have nowhere to go because you got me expelled from school.

785
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,670
What will you do?

786
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,720
What will you do? Shit.

787
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,260
He tried to defend because that guy was attacking.

788
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,520
Definitely a self-defense.

789
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,040
It's a bit unclear, isn't it?

790
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,350
What will you do?

791
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,700
The moment he dropped the knife and Chan Yeong picked up the knife,

792
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,850
you can say he stopped the attack.

793
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,740
You know similar cases.

794
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,500
It's self-defense if he kept attacking.

795
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,010
They'll say he stabbed him after the attack ended.

796
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,690
No, the attack didn't end.

797
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,660
He followed him to the new school.

798
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,020
You can't say he was attacking only that day.

799
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,010
His abuse and attacks have been ongoing?

800
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,480
That'd be worth a try.

801
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,370
He hasn't been arrested yet, right?

802
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,800
Isn't it because it could've been self-defense?

803
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,930
It's okay. It's better to lessen the sentence.

804
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,610
Even if we insist that,

805
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:38,060
they'll indict him and reach a ruling, anyway.

806
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,740
What's with you?

807
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,400
The public defender's voice phishing case I was on.

808
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,170
She ended up getting fined 10 million won.

809
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,730
- What?
- She went to prison to work it off today.

810
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,180
If I asked for a lesser sentence instead of insisting on innocence,

811
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,010
she would've been fined a few million less.

812
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,620
But I'm sure Ms. Kim didn't give you that case

813
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,590
just so you can get him a lesser sentence through extenuation.

814
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:11,660
She must care since he's her foundation's scholarship student.

815
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,300
Did she have a foundation?

816
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,320
Ju Hyeong and Hui Ji mentioned last time.

817
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,540
Weren't you listening?

818
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,380
She seemed to care a lot.

819
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,800
Yes.

820
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,880
I'm sorry, but this is my case.

821
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,380
I don't want to risk

822
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,680
lessening the sentence by claiming his innocence.

823
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,900
If you want to help, help me lessen the sentence.

824
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,460
Hey, Dad.

825
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,310
Start working for the company.

826
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,900
Pardon?

827
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,060
You worked as an attorney enough.

828
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,390
Since when did it have an expiration date?

829
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,120
You aren't serious about the job, anyway.

830
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,910
Is there a reason you became an attorney?

831
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,070
You just ended up there while studying.

832
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,930
You used to insist I join Hanguk Group's in-house attorney.

833
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,560
That has purpose and reason, you jerk.

834
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,700
I'm doing fine as is.

835
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,940
Don't worry about me.

836
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,100
Tell me.

837
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,430
Is there a reason you have to keep working this job?

838
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,170
Stop living like that and help the family business.

839
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,320
You remember you're an only child, right?

840
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,630
Gosh, stop bringing that up.

841
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,750
Join the company.

842
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,520
I don't want to work forever.

843
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,530
This is a nice place to be alone, right?

844
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,540
You came, Ms. Kim.

845
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:59,000
How's Chan Yeong's case going?

846
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,360
I've been looking into it,

847
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:09,360
but pleading guilty and explaining the situation would be the best.

848
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,930
Is that so?

849
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,830
There's no choice, then.

850
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,300
By the way, is something going on?

851
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,680
Well, no.

852
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,930
Can I sit for a moment?

853
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,730
Have a seat.

854
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:37,010
It says on your face. That you have a concern.

855
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,760
Well, you know...

856
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,310
you went to law school, Ms. Kim.

857
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,230
How did you end up running a business?

858
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,400
To be honest, I wanted to become an attorney, too.

859
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:04,480
But I found another job because I kept failing the bar exam.

860
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,690
Why did you want to become an attorney, then?

861
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:13,300
Well, let's see.

862
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,900
I think I wanted to make a lot of money.

863
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:23,090
I wanted to enjoy my life and help those in need.

864
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,720
And I wanted to buy a building, too.

865
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,400
You achieved everything.

866
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,660
I suppose.

867
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,480
I chose a different path, but I achieved everything.

868
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:45,780
If I happen to end up starting a business,

869
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,610
I'd appreciate your advice.

870
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,160
I can't do it for free, though.

871
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,370
Anytime.

872
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,290
What brings you here?

873
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,070
Have a look at this.

874
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,940
It started when he was in the 11th grade.

875
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,210
Yes. I'm surprised he endured it thus far.

876
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:21,200
This would be enough of a mitigating factor, right?

877
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,460
His family could be struggling since he's a scholarship student.

878
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,400
Add that, too. It could be a mitigating factor.

879
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,390
Yes, I suppose.

880
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,860
Since he's regretting what he did,

881
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,740
I'll ask them to look at the documents and understand.

882
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:38,540
I'll submit a written opinion for that.

883
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,880
Shouldn't you ask if he's regretting, by the way?

884
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,610
Everything else is an objective truth.

885
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,330
You can ask for consideration as an attorney,

886
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,610
but you should ask him if he's regretting it.

887
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:53,120
We can't just say he's regretting it.

888
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,950
Yeah...

889
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,160
I don't regret it.

890
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,430
Chan Yeong, you could think that way,

891
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:09,210
but if you say you don't regret it, you might get punished more.

892
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,540
It's not that I don't regret it, because I think I did a good thing.

893
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:22,230
It's true I did... something bad on purpose.

894
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,580
Fine.

895
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,280
You admit your fault.

896
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,820
Your sentence will be lessened if you say you regret it that way.

897
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:34,140
I should be punished if I did something wrong.

898
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,660
If regretting it lessens your sin,

899
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,540
he can just regret it, too.

900
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,310
Why did you want to do something bad?

901
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:59,160
Because... I couldn't keep living that way.

902
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,480
I transferred to escape him somehow,

903
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,890
but he followed me there, too.

904
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,350
So, I gave up.

905
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,320
I thought I should become a bad person, too.

906
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,810
You're not the same as him.

907
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,970
So, don't give up.

908
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,880
Let's do well today.

909
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,270
Okay.

910
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,590
Since this might be my last case.

918
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,540
My husband died.

919
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,690
Our company doesn't force like that.

920
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,050
This could become an issue.

921
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,960
They offered a much higher fee. What can I do?

922
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,240
I couldn't represent both.

923
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,670
How dare you pick and choose cases?

924
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,050
This doesn't make him innocent.

925
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,810
I'll pay a handsome fee.

926
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:56,000
That makes sense as a managing partner.

927
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,020
You need to be on my side at times like this.

928
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,940
How's the mother?

929
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,870
It's so unfair.

930
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:06,700
Stuff like this never bothered you before.

931
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,010
