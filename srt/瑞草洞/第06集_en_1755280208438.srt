2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,500
Did you know that Attorney Ha was from a conglomerate family?

3
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,900
I had no idea.

4
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,670
I just found out from the article.

5
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,670
I was honestly so shocked.

6
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,910
How can someone be so two-faced? It's so scary.

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,310
You're not secretly an heir, either, right?

8
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,670
Let's stop... and get back to work.

9
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,000
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Okay.

10
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,250
Can I get an egg?

11
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,880
Sure.

12
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,260
Are they reporters?

13
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,260
Isn't that Hanguk Group's secretariat?

14
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,530
Read the room.

15
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,200
What?

16
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,300
- What?
- Nothing.

17
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,070
Work together?

18
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
I've never co-counseled a case before.

19
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,740
Okay then.

20
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,390
Since they only have one associate, Attorney Kang Hui Ji will take that side.

21
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,810
Since we have two associates,

22
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,860
I'll check with Attorney Bae on our side.

23
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,260
I'll just take it.

24
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,650
The Advisor gave us this case under the condition

25
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,600
that we co-counsel it with another floor.

26
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,900
There he comes.

27
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,870
I guess you decided to take it, Attorney An.

28
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,710
- Am I working with An Ju Hyeong?
- Yeah.

29
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,310
You two know each other, right?

30
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,840
Yes.

31
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,800
Now that I see you like this, you guys look great together.

32
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,230
Pardon?

33
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,140
Well then, please take good care of Attorney Kang.

34
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
Please keep it professional.

35
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,820
Well, which side do we need to represent?

36
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,510
The plaintiff, Kang Chang Jun.

37
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,290
Hey, say something, damn it!

38
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,400
Why don't you listen when I tell you something?

39
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,940
How many times did I tell you?

40
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,780
What? Are you offended?

41
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,600
Damn it, you won't even answer me.

42
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,730
I said answer me, asshole!

43
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,770
You asshole!

44
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,060
Get up, get up, you asshole.

45
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,860
We got a report about a fight.

46
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,290
Thank you for your service.

47
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,470
Yes, hello.

48
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,940
But there's really no problem here.

49
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,030
It's okay. I think you can go now.

50
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,370
There's no issue here.

51
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,970
If you come down here like this...

52
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,020
Are those the two who were fighting?

53
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,560
No, no. There's no problem.

54
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,370
Have you ever seen him hit people before?

55
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,190
No, it was the first time.

56
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,000
If it happened before, I wouldn't have been shocked. But...

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,040
he was beating him like an animal.

58
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,560
So, I felt compelled to call the police. But now...

59
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,660
the guy who got beaten up says he wasn't hit.

60
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,280
And you were told not to come starting the next day?

61
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes.

62
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,110
After he found out I called the police, he told me right away not to come.

63
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,150
Did he give you a reason?

64
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,790
I'm sure he didn't say it was because you reported it.

65
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,690
He didn't give any reasons. He just said. "Don't come."

66
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,710
What did I do wrong that I should leave?

67
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,650
Isn't this what you call a wrongful dismissal?

68
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,800
Right, Attorney?

69
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,220
Put everything else aside,

70
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,110
they didn't follow any of the proper procedures for dismissal.

71
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,040
So wouldn't it be easiest to focus on that aspect?

72
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,630
It's true they didn't follow the dismissal procedures under the Labor Standards Act.

73
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,970
Then, isn't it resolved?

74
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,720
But the issue is whether we can establish Kang Chang Jun as a worker.

75
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,490
He's a club DJ. Does he qualify as a worker under the law?

76
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh, worker classification.

77
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
You're right.

78
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,380
We need to get that recognized first.

79
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,200
But from what we've heard so far, it's vague.

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,780
He has no employment contract, no national insurance,

81
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,180
no solid way to prove his working hours,

82
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,590
and he wasn't working every day, either.

83
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,750
What about pay? He must've been paid, right?

84
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,040
Yeah, he probably was.

85
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,310
But because his shifts weren't regular,

86
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,130
his pay probably varied month to month.

87
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,310
Then, it won't look like a fixed salary.

88
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,710
More like he was paid per performance.

89
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,660
Exactly. Even if we prove that he was a worker,

90
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,710
since it currently looks like Kang Chang Jun falsely reported Lee Dong Su,

91
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,640
they might argue that the dismissal wasn't wrongful.

92
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,460
Even if this dismissal is invalid due to not following the procedure,

93
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,000
they could follow the procedure next time and fire him again for the same reason.

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,660
That's right. That's the issue.

95
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,380
Then, should we meet that person first?

96
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,170
- Who?
- The guy who got hit. Jeong Min Gyu.

97
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,090
Where?

98
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,900
- You came dressed like this?
- I should ask you that.

99
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,550
Of course. I came to work. How else?

100
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,350
We should hide that we're here for work.

101
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,400
At least take off your tie.

102
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
- Geez, why should I take off my tie?
- Just listen to me.

103
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,740
And let's open the top two buttons.

104
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,050
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

105
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,860
Take off that jacket.

106
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,470
Take off my jacket, too? It's cold!

107
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,620
- Take it off.
- Okay.

108
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,880
Much better.

109
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,380
But did we really have to come here?

110
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,060
Kang Chang Jun doesn't know his number, either.

111
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,100
I'm sure we could've found out somehow.

112
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,600
We don't have time to wait for that. Let's go.

113
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,760
You said you came to work.

114
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,040
Excuse me, is Jeong Min Gyu here?

115
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,270
Who?

116
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,550
Jeong Min Gyu.

117
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,050
Try over there.

118
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,160
Excuse me.

119
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,950
Hi. Are you looking for the restroom?

120
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,070
This area is for staff only. You can't be here.

121
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,390
You're Jeong Min Gyu, right?

122
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,440
- Who are you?
- You know Kang Chang Jun, right?

123
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,530
- Yes.
- We're Kang Chang Jun's attorneys.

124
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,760
When you were assaulted, he called the police

125
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,520
and got fired.

126
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,080
- Fired?
- Yes.

127
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,270
So, we were hoping to hear from you about what happened.

128
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,920
He misunderstood and reported by mistake.

129
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,090
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy.

130
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,460
We can help you as well, Jeong Min Gyu.

131
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,450
I got hit because I deserved it.

132
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,270
It's not a big deal.

133
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,010
It's not serious enough to need your help, Attorneys.

134
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,120
Next time you come,

135
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,570
let me get you a table and enjoy yourselves.

136
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,820
That's how you can help me.

137
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,250
I don't know what took place,

138
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,030
but there's no such thing as deserving a beating.

139
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
No matter what you did,

140
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,040
Lee Dong Su had no right to hit you.

141
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,580
So, if you change your mind, please call me.

142
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,340
Who are you?

143
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,630
This area is only for staff. You can't be here.

144
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,720
Where did you come from?

145
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,080
Are you hiring DJs?

146
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,280
I heard there was an opening.

147
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,990
- A DJ?
- I wasn't sure who I needed to talk to.

148
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,710
Both of you?

149
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,300
You don't hire teams?

150
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,300
"Are you hiring DJs?"

151
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,960
"You don't hire teams?"

152
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,940
I had no choice because you started out with DJs.

153
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,470
You should've said we're the DJ and manager.

154
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,350
- Called you my manager?
- No, you'd be my manager.

155
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,490
Well, anyone can see that you'd be my manager, and I'd be the DJ.

156
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,600
You don't look like a DJ, either.

157
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,230
In any case, do you think he'll call?

158
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,090
It won't be easy to get his testimony.

159
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,140
We'll have to wait and see.

160
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,700
I still have my wristband on.

161
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,950
- Give me your arm.
- No, it's all right.

162
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,780
Come on.

163
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,890
I guess you've gone clubbing quite a bit.

164
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,070
Yes. You haven't?

165
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,480
No.

166
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,260
And you said you were a DJ?

167
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm getting off here.

168
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,500
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

169
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,050
Hello, Attorney.

170
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,020
- Hello, sir.
- You're coming in now?

171
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,770
Yes. Are you going somewhere?

172
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,960
I ran out of coffee this morning,

173
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,500
so I'm heading to the store to restock.

174
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,830
Chief, would you like this?

175
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,410
It's perfect instead of coffee on an empty stomach.

176
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,900
Goodness, thank you.

177
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,380
Hello.

178
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,540
How long will it take?

179
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,200
Just a moment.

180
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
Security Chief, what's all this?

181
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,250
Oh, this?

182
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,890
They're installing a base station in our building.

183
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,490
Oh, really?

184
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,560
Apparently, the rent for this is quite high.

185
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,450
Then, will the Advisor give you a bonus?

186
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,520
Gosh, I can't expect such a thing.

187
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,040
Go on your way, Attorney.

188
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,610
Yes. Have a good day.

189
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,460
Thank you.

190
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,500
Is there anything else you need?

191
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,840
This should be enough to work with.

192
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,830
Also, if the dismissal is ruled wrongful,

193
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,730
you can claim back wages for the time you couldn't work.

194
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,430
We'll include that in the claim.

195
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,420
No.

196
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,340
All I need is a ruling that proves

197
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,070
that my dismissal was baseless and that I did nothing wrong.

198
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,700
I don't want to be paid for the time I didn't work.

199
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,270
This is your legal right as the one who was

200
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,570
wrongfully dismissed, Kang Chang Jun.

201
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,890
You don't have to think like that.

202
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,180
All I want is to work there again with my head held high.

203
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,510
But do you really want to go back there?

204
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,070
Yes.

205
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,590
After all I went through to come from the countryside

206
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,460
to make it to a club in Hongdae?

207
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,380
There's no reason I can't keep working there.

208
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,500
I've done nothing wrong.

209
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,480
Okay, then we'll proceed with only invalidating the dismissal.

210
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,150
Thank you.

211
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,390
Yes, this is Hyungmin Law Group.

212
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,440
Okay. May I ask who's calling?

213
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
Yes?

214
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,440
A school senior?

215
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,770
Okay, then connect me.

216
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,570
Yes, I'm on the line.

217
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,430
Is this Attorney Ha Sang Ki?

218
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,800
Yes. That's right.

219
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,190
I'm Director Lee Min Woo from HR Hunting.

220
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm a headhunter.

221
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,370
You graduated from Gwangseong University Law School, right?

222
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm an alum, too.

223
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,290
Oh, I see.

224
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm sorry, but what is this about?

225
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,310
A startup that just completed Series C funding

226
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,540
wants to bring you onboard as a director-level legal counsel.

227
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,990
What do you think?

228
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,900
The compensation will be at an executive-level at a major corporation.

229
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,260
Me?

230
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,560
Yes.

231
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,130
They specifically asked for you.

232
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,450
That's why I'm calling.

233
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,310
Well, I've never worked in-house before.

234
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,920
But why me, though?

235
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,980
Well, they're looking to build a relationship with Hanguk Group.

236
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,910
It appears they're hoping you could help with that.

237
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,810
I'm sorry. I'm going to hang up.

238
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,980
Can I say something about that?

239
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,950
Yes, what are you referring to?

240
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,940
The article...

241
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,610
Is it true?

242
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,390
It's not.

243
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,240
Okay.

244
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,600
That will be our stance, then.

245
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,130
- Let me know if anything uncomfortable comes up.
- It's all good.

246
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,800
Okay.

247
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,200
Gosh, it's freezing.

248
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,270
He's here, he's here.

249
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,940
Where's Sang Ki?

250
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,570
He said something urgent came up. He said we can start.

251
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,820
So...

252
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,220
no one is going to say anything about Sang Ki?

253
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,300
He asked us to overlook it.

254
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,700
- Is that what that meant?
- Of course.

255
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,870
I told you to read the room.

256
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,000
- Is yours bulgogi?
- Yeah.

257
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,290
Swap with me.

258
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,850
Okay.

259
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,660
But did you guys know?

260
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,380
No, we didn't know.

261
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Did you know, Oppa?

262
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,250
No, I didn't know.

263
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,180
I was the most clueless.

264
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,960
Why are you getting all upset about?

265
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,550
He didn't want us to know.

266
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,820
Yeah, let's give Senior Sang Ki some time.

267
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,540
What's wrong with you now?

268
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,710
Damn it.

269
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,870
Going home now?

270
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,350
Yeah.

271
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,520
You should've told me at least.

272
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,760
- What do you mean?
- That my family

273
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,430
made money subcontracting for your family.

274
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,860
It must've been so funny to you every time I brought it up.

275
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,560
- It's not like that.
- Even if you didn't feel that way,

276
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,370
now that I've found out this way,

277
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,700
I can't help but think that.

278
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,680
It's not like that.

279
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,450
Then, what is it?

280
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,460
What are you trying to do?

281
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,400
You still have nothing to say to me?

282
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,900
Even if it's not about my family,

283
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,830
I thought we were closer than just work colleagues.

284
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,710
I thought we could talk openly about anything.

285
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,560
I don't talk about my family with just anyone.

286
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,540
I told you because it was you.

287
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,920
I guess I was the only one who thought we were friends.

288
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,730
I'm sorry.

289
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,570
In response to the plaintiff's claims,

290
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,110
the defendant has denied the plaintiff's worker status,

291
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,670
and the plaintiff has submitted evidence to prove it.

292
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

293
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,300
Plaintiff's counsel,

294
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,640
could you briefly explain your evidence?

295
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,890
Yes. First, please take a look at

296
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,060
Exhibit No. 3, the plaintiff's transit card records.

297
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,950
They show that he consistently arrived and left

298
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,490
at the same time each day at the defendant's club.

299
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,020
If you look at Exhibit No. 4, the plaintiff's cell tower data,

300
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,630
...it shows his location at Seogyo-dong in Mapo-gu during commuting hours,

301
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,860
and the defendant's club is located in Seogyo-dong.

302
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,920
The plaintiff had fixed working hours

303
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,320
even when he wasn't performing.

304
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,760
His pay may appear inconsistent month to month,

305
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,980
but it directly correlates with the days he worked,

306
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,810
and you can see that it has nothing to do with the number of performances.

307
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,960
This proves it was a salary for coming into work

308
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,260
rather than as payments for gigs.

309
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,580
Moreover, if you look at the text details between the plaintiff and defendant,

310
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,900
you can see the plaintiff worked under the direct supervision of the defendant.

311
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,360
You also do the 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. slots.

312
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,950
I'm telling you to do them because the other guy can't make it.

313
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,960
Why complain? There's not much to do. Just go home.

314
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,160
- Defendant's counsel?
- Yes?

315
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,770
Are those text messages actually from the defendant?

316
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,560
- Defendant's counsel?
- Were they sent by the defendant?

317
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,940
Attorney?

318
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,900
Who are you talking to?

319
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,120
The defendant, Mr. Lee Dong Su.

320
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,880
Are you the defendant himself?

321
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,580
- Yes.
- Please come up to the front.

322
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,550
- Defendant's counsel?
- Yes?

323
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,730
Did you know he was sitting in the back?

324
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,090
Well...

325
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,080
If the defendant is present, he should sit in the front.

326
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,350
Why were you in the back?

327
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,770
Does it mean you have something to hide?

328
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,170
No, it's not like that.

329
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,150
You didn't follow the proper dismissal procedure, right?

330
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,320
He's not a worker, so it wasn't a dismissal.

331
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,820
Did you follow the proper procedure?

332
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,820
How's a club DJ a worker?

333
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,870
I guess you weren't listening despite sitting back there.

334
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,800
That's what we've just been proving.

335
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,940
Kang Chang Jun is a worker.

336
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,550
All right, plaintiff's counsel.

337
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,330
Please refrain from addressing the defendant directly.

338
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,940
Yes. I'm sorry.

339
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,090
Great work today.

340
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,540
Hello, Advisor.

341
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,900
I stopped by out of curiosity.

342
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,400
- You were really prepared.
- Yes.

343
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,350
Hey, I've got records of your false police report.

344
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,670
I could just fire you again with those.

345
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,240
Jeong Min Gyu gave us his full testimony.

346
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,600
He admitted there was an assault

347
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,990
and that the report wasn't false.

348
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,250
I came because what you said the other day stuck with me,

349
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,870
but I don't think I can do this.

350
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,350
If I give you my statement,

351
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,390
do you think I can keep working there?

352
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,280
Kang Chang Jun reported it

353
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,440
in order to help you.

354
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,780
Did I ask for his help?

355
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,080
Others are trying to help you like this.

356
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,190
Why won't you take care of yourself?

357
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,680
There's no such thing as "deserving to be hit."

358
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,440
You don't have to testify for us.

359
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,990
But at least protect yourself.

360
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,160
I'll help you.

361
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,500
Min Gyu, that jerk...

362
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,200
A complaint from Jeong Min Gyu will also be filed soon.

363
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,790
Just leave me alone!

364
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,120
Why do you keep following me around! So annoying...

365
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,110
How does Lee Dong Su know the Advisor?

366
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,410
Who's the Advisor?

367
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,110
You don't know Advisor Kim Hyeong Min?

368
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,920
No, I don't.

369
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,010
Really?

370
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,300
Is the Advisor that rich?

371
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,510
She owns this building.

372
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,300
- This building?
- Yeah.

373
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,510
That's amazing.

374
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,780
- Did you know?
- Well, I figured that might be the case.

375
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,110
She's Kim Hyeong Min of the Hyungmin Building.

376
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,000
You're right.

377
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,620
Did you two know, too?

378
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,410
No, I didn't know.

379
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,810
What about you?

380
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,620
I didn't know, either.

381
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,100
I'm clueless about stuff like that these days.

382
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,360
But what's with your reaction?

383
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,560
This is such big news. This isn't like you.

384
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,240
It's not like I can freak out over everything.

385
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,990
What?

386
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,730
What's wrong with him?

387
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,230
You'll be back here in a few days anyway.

388
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,630
Don't assert your pride.

389
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,800
It'll only eat you up inside.

390
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,630
Hello.

391
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,800
It's you. You may enter.

392
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,830
Hello.

393
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,060
Hello, Managing Partner.

394
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,810
When you said you'd work for the office above for better pay,

395
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,670
I respected that.

396
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,770
It was honest.

397
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,850
They offered more money. Of course, you should go.

398
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,700
Whether it's a floor above or the firm across from us.

399
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,900
However, it now appears that it was all a lie.

400
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,720
If you didn't like our firm, you should've just said so.

401
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,200
Why did you use your salary as an excuse?

402
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,640
Mr. Seong, it's really not like that.

403
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,850
If you think that because of the article, it's a big misunderstanding.

404
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,540
All right.

405
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,000
- It'll be a bit cold.
- Okay.

406
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,490
She's my daughter.

407
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,700
Oh, I see.

408
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,970
I don't know where to start.

409
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,560
Please take your time.

410
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,320
Or would you prefer that I ask you some questions?

411
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,300
No.

412
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,510
I'll talk.

413
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,760
When she was young,

414
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,680
we sent her to study abroad in the U.S.

415
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,850
In the 8th grade.

416
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,000
I think that's the appropriate place to begin.

417
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,380
Since that turned out to be an error in judgment.

418
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,060
Did Kim Yu Jin go alone?

419
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,520
Yes. We sent her alone.

420
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,120
Her father and I had too much going on here.

421
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,910
We thought sending her, albeit alone, was better for her future.

422
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,410
We trusted she would do well in the U.S.

423
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,910
even if she's alone since she's our daughter.

424
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,130
But that's where she was introduced to drugs.

425
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,710
Yes.

426
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,490
She said she first started in college.

427
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,040
We actually knew early on.

428
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,160
We tried taking her to therapy,

429
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,320
brought her back to Korea to live together,

430
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,760
and we even moved to the States

431
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,440
to stay with her.

432
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,920
But nothing worked.

433
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,810
Then, does Kim Yu Jin have a criminal record for drug use?

434
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,560
No.

435
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,150
This is the first time that she has been arrested.

436
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,360
She was put under immediate arrest.

437
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,970
Where was the location of the arrest?

438
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,950
Incheon Airport.

439
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,550
She was arrested as soon as she landed.

440
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,840
As soon as she landed?

441
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,970
Then, someone probably tipped them off.

442
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,320
Do you know who?

443
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,760
Yes.

444
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,580
It was me.

445
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,720
Though she is our daughter, our efforts alone weren't enough.

446
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,890
So...

447
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,320
we told her to come to Korea...

448
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,560
and we reported her.

449
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,890
And...

450
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,170
I want her to be released from detention.

451
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,630
That's why I came here.

452
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,450
Please help her, Attorney.

453
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,370
- Heading out now?
- Yeah.

454
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,110
- Heading out now?
- Yeah.

455
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,270
What's with this awkward air?

456
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,400
This is so unfamiliar.

457
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,760
- Hello. Attorney Ha Sang Ki, right?
- Pardon?

458
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,010
We're from News Off.

459
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,290
We're following up on the elite family law school admissions article.

460
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,040
That's not me. You've got the wrong guy.

461
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,060
You have the best background of all the admitted students...

462
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,910
- Hey. Stop. He said no.
- Do you believe you deserved your spot?

463
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,750
- Stop it.
- All right, all right. We get it.

464
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,830
You got the wrong person.

465
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,760
We know it's you, Attorney. Please give us a statement.

466
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,130
I said it's not me.

467
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,400
- Please stop this.
- Why don't you talk with me?

468
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,120
- Mr. Ha Sang Ki.
- You go on.

469
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,290
I said go on.

470
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,500
- It doesn't cost anything to talk!
- Mr. Ha Sang Ki, wait!

471
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,590
I know many fun stories.

472
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,500
Crazy jerk.

473
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,240
At a time like this?

474
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,840
When I was in college, my nickname was the Spirit of Spring.

475
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,610
Because I would vanish in the fall

476
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,130
and return whenever spring came.

477
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,900
I had to work through the fall

478
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,840
to afford tuition for the spring semester.

479
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,530
That's why it took me eight years to graduate.

480
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,560
I was what they call a "dirt spoon."

481
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,820
During my difficult, impoverished childhood,

482
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,460
studying was all I could do.

483
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,490
Because it felt like the only way out.

484
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,900
After graduation,

485
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,670
I wasn't even planning to go to law school, nor did I have the means.

486
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,690
But after six months of working,

487
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,580
I felt like I had to go back and study.

488
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,850
Maybe I was a Spirit of Spring after all.

489
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,120
If not for the school and third-party scholarships,

490
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,110
I could've never become an attorney.

491
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,630
I'm always thankful for the kindness of strangers

492
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,090
and the support that came through the system.

493
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:11,290
And I hope to pass it on someday.

494
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,700
As for the modern-day nepotism,

495
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,150
I don't really know much about that.

496
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,060
All I know is that students study hard

497
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,830
to become good attorneys.

498
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,410
Even the classmate you mistook me for

499
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,360
due to our similar names, probably did the same.

500
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,460
So please, don't criticize him, either.

501
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,940
And I hope no one ever has to

502
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,620
go through what I did tonight,

503
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,340
having to prove their poverty.

504
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,080
One bowl of rice soup, please.

505
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,150
This isn't your dinner, right?

506
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,800
No, I had dinner way earlier.

507
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,760
Then, why don't you just rest?

508
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,340
Why come all the way here this late?

509
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,120
I'm fine.

510
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,840
But you should stop working so late, Mom.

511
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,230
I should keep working as long as the owner lets me work.

512
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,800
Sitting around would only make me sick.

513
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,010
Who gets sick from sitting around?

514
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,230
Working too much makes people ill.

515
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,770
Can I get some more radish kimchi here?

516
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,570
Okay.

517
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,800
Hold on a second.

518
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,120
Have a fried egg before you go.

519
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,470
I recently handled Crystal Park's divorce case.

520
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,510
- What?
- What?

521
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,400
I represented the husband against Crystal Park.

522
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,670
And it ended through mediation.

523
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,640
- Wow!
- Amazing!

524
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,340
I even met her privately afterward and talked to her.

525
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,220
Wow!

526
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,000
Honestly, I've been doing visitation attorney work recently.

527
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,970
- Visitation attorney work?
- You know,

528
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,000
going in like a butler to keep them company,

529
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,540
update them on the outside world and entertain them.

530
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,570
The stuff we're not supposed to do.

531
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,920
- You were doing that?
- Your boss makes you do that?

532
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,030
Exactly.

533
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,060
When I go there now, they don't even check my attorney ID anymore

534
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,110
because I go there so often.

535
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,930
To be honest, I'm pregnant.

536
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,800
- What?
- What?

537
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,700
So, just in case, I haven't taken rhinitis meds,

538
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,120
and stopped drinking coffee. And of course, not alcohol.

539
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,070
I get worried when I'm working late

540
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,390
and even when I'm running around.

541
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,130
Wait, does Ji Seok know?

542
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,530
Hey, since when? How long has it been?

543
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,290
They said six weeks.

544
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,690
I already knew all of this.

545
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,880
- What?
- What? How?

546
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,960
You kept checking your period tracking app

547
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,790
and spitting food out.

548
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,690
How about Ju Hyeong's case?

549
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,240
When I ran into him at the family court,

550
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,340
I looked up his case number and party names.

551
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,270
- What about Chang Won?
- He told me that himself.

552
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,090
Wow, seriously.

553
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,540
You're incredible.

554
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,860
But wasn't I the main character today?

555
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,420
- Why would you be?
- Why, Oppa?

556
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,600
Why would you be?

557
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,240
What for?

558
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,690
You probably didn't know, but when I was young, I was really—

559
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,570
We know. You wrote such a long post. Why bring it up again?

560
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,550
You knew about it?

561
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,970
You posted it publicly for everyone to see.

562
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,130
Didn't you ask us to play ignorant?

563
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,730
- Wait, Ha Sang Ki.
- What?

564
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,710
If it took you eight years to graduate

565
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,590
and you worked in between,

566
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,240
then you didn't do military service, did you?

567
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,280
You've been pretending like you did all this time!

568
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,290
I did do military service, man! Six months.

569
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,470
My dad is a National Merit recipient.

570
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,710
The food won't be good if it gets cold.

571
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,160
Okay, we'll eat it right away.

572
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,850
Let's eat.

573
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,090
Crazies...

574
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,050
Hey...

575
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,690
Well...

576
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,000
- Sorry about that.
- No need.

577
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,330
Thanks for what you did yesterday.

578
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,850
Gosh, I take it back.

579
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,550
This is so awkward. Geez...

580
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,070
I didn't mean it, either, you jerk.

581
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:13,070
I cringed first, you know!

582
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,540
- He's so weird.
- Hey, wait up!

583
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,880
Hey!

584
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,790
Wait up.

585
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,780
I thought you wanted me to ignore it,

586
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,570
but you really weren't?

587
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,850
That's right.

588
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,120
That person wasn't me. I told you so.

589
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,000
Why didn't you deny it more emphatically from the start?

590
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,810
Why did you wait until everyone dragged your name through the mud?

591
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,410
Pardon?

592
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,190
Did you read all the comments, too?

593
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,620
Well, they were visible everywhere.

594
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,010
Was it really that hard to say

595
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:49,180
that it wasn't you, and it was someone with a similar name?

596
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:55,010
I mean, I just hoped it would blow over.

597
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,740
Honestly,

598
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,640
I didn't want to think about how I grew up poor,

599
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,560
and if I denied it too emphatically,

600
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,980
I felt like I was telling them to criticize that classmate.

601
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,310
I didn't want that, either.

602
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,720
Attorney Ha, I didn't know you had this side.

603
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,580
I thought you were the ultimate individualist.

604
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:17,630
Yes, it turns out I did.

605
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,270
I see that now.

606
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,330
Yes?

607
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,870
What are you doing? Why are you here in my office?

608
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,250
We're still collaborating on Mr. Kang Chang Jun's case.

609
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,810
But the hearing is over. Our job is done.

610
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,040
There's still the ruling hearing left. It's not over yet.

611
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,250
- Ruling hearing?
- Let's go.

612
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,320
Why would we go to the ruling hearing?

613
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,830
Don't you want to see how it goes?

614
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,860
It's your first collaboration case in ten years.

615
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,310
Let's go. We'll be late.

616
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,270
Gosh, I told you it's nine years, not ten.

617
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,520
All right, fine. Nine years.

618
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,920
Hurry up, let's go.

619
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,480
Fine...

620
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,950
Case number...

621
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,950
2024-Gadan-25134.

622
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,050
Plaintiff Kang Chang Jun.

623
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,240
Defendant Lee Dong Su.

624
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,920
Neither party is present, right?

625
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,670
Here.

626
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,030
Kang Chang Jun's counsel is present?

627
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,700
- Yes.
- And the plaintiff himself is present?

628
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,910
Yes, that is correct.

629
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:27,800
Very well. I'll now declare the ruling.

630
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:35,070
The dismissal issued to the plaintiff on September 3, 2024, by the defendant

631
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,260
is hereby declared invalid.

632
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,140
The defendant shall bear the litigation costs.

633
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,740
I judge in favor of the plaintiff.

634
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,040
Thank you.

635
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,240
Case number 2024-GaDan-1987.

636
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,090
Plaintiff Botino Inc. Defendant Flik LLC.

637
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,700
Neither party is present, right?

638
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,020
The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

639
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,930
The plaintiff shall bear the litigation costs.

640
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,640
How was it? Aren't you glad you came?

641
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,010
I didn't even do anything there.

642
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,240
We were going to win anyway.

643
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,340
Damn it.

644
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,420
You...

645
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,300
Why did you have to introduce Kim Ji Seok to me?

646
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,330
Now I'm married and pregnant.

647
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,220
Why are you so mad about something to be celebrated?

648
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,810
Who says this is to be celebrated?

649
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,690
Who do you think you are?

650
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,270
And I'm the one who decides how to feel about it.

651
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:31,350
But I haven't yet, so could you shut up?

652
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,120
Damn it!

653
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,580
Is it that hard?

654
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,520
Yeah, it's hard.

655
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,790
This is making me worry in so many ways.

656
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,510
And I'm not someone with maternal instincts.

657
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,370
I don't think I'd develop any in the future, either.

658
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,300
That's what you're worried about?

659
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,830
Why do you think you need to have maternal instincts?

660
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,920
Of course, I need maternal instincts.

661
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,330
I'll need to raise a child.

662
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,530
But you like people in general.

663
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,930
You just swear a lot. That's all.

664
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,390
I'm sure you'll love your child, too.

665
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,940
Why worry so much about that?

666
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,200
It doesn't have to be maternal instincts.

667
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,190
I...

668
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,450
like people in general?

669
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,550
Yeah. You didn't know?

670
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,460
You're oddly kind lately.

671
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,370
No, I'm not.

672
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,440
Attorney.

673
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,110
Mr. Jang Su Gil went to court today.

674
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,330
I hear it's his ruling hearing.

675
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,240
Ruling hearing?

676
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,770
Gosh, you're so funny.

677
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,990
Attorney Jo, you're here?

678
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,620
Wow.

679
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,610
You look way better out here.

680
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,730
- I told you I'd get out, didn't I?
- He got acquitted. Not guilty.

681
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,060
I see. Congratulations.

682
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,190
Thanks for the fruit.

683
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,050
Yeah, yeah. Enjoy yourself.

684
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,350
I wasn't joking back then.

685
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,460
Come work for me. I'll treat you well.

686
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,570
See you around.

687
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,070
Please bring this to my office.

688
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,040
What are the prosecutors even doing?

689
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,300
They can't even convict a guy like him.

690
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,180
There were pretty female attorneys here after all.

691
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,880
Why did they send me a guy?

692
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,590
Who the hell is this creep?

693
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,790
Do you know me?

694
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,750
Move!

695
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,980
I'm sorry.

696
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,540
What the hell?

697
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,120
Do I really like people?

698
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,310
Everyone, gather up. My treat.

699
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,380
It's a pregnancy party!

700
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,080
Hello?

701
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,650
Are you home?

702
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,660
I'm heading home on the subway.

703
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,120
Are you still at work?

704
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,010
Yeah, I'm still at work.

705
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,600
I might be a bit late.

706
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,110
I see. Okay.

707
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,140
Is that why you called?

708
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,580
- No.
- Then?

709
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,690
My phone's dying. Tell me quickly.

710
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,210
- What is it?
- I'm pregnant.

711
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,760
Hello?

712
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,170
- Yeah.
- I said I'm pregnant.

713
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,880
They say I'm six weeks in.

714
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,360
Yeah.

715
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,540
That's it.

716
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,010
No one's here yet?

717
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,550
No.

718
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,750
Mun Jeong!

719
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,760
What the...

720
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,600
Why did you come here?

721
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,330
Well...

722
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,230
earlier, I was just... so shocked...

723
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,850
s-so shocked...

724
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,090
It was just that I was so shocked.

725
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,490
Well...

726
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,990
But then, my p-phone ran out of battery and died...

727
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,030
I t-thought you might be freaking out...

728
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,460
You're nuts.

729
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,700
Why are you crying?

730
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,020
I'm sorry. I-I was just so shocked...

731
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,310
You must've been so scared...

732
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:32,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

733
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,880
Then, you're happy that I'm pregnant?

734
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,910
You're happy, right?

735
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:47,510
What kind of question is that? Of course I am!

736
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,130
- You're cold, right?
- Yeah, I'm cold.

737
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,400
Let's hurry up and go home.

738
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,310
Watch your head.

739
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,430
Your seatbelt.

740
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,190
Gosh...

741
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,410
It's really cold out today, isn't it?

742
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,520
So, you went home and brought the car?

743
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,450
Yeah, I came out in such a rush.

744
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,480
Drive safely.

745
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,330
You might get into an accident.

746
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,450
Let's feast tonight!

747
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,560
Gosh, you scared me.

748
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,510
It's a bar, man. A bar, not a restaurant.

749
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:00,510
Hey, you think I can't feast at a bar?

750
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,680
What's wrong with you?

751
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,940
Hello, how are you guys?

752
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,360
Hello.

753
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,180
I guess you're going home.

754
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,900
Yes.

755
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,820
Attorney Ha, you must've had a rough time.

756
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,530
Oh, no, not at all.

757
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,610
­

758
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,560
Well then, I'll see you around.

759
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,970
- Okay.
- Okay, good night.

760
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,360
So... I'm sorry,

761
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,150
but I have to cancel today's party.

762
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,870
Everyone go home. Don't party without me.

763
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,020
Geez, what's the matter with her?

764
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,420
She says we should all go home.

765
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,240
I saw it, too.

766
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,460
Gosh, seriously...

767
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,540
Maybe we should just grab a drink by ourselves.

768
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,410
Where?

769
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,570
Hey, tell me where!

770
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,010
Are you buying?

771
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,280
Could you please tell me where we're going?

772
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,430
Could you please stop asking me?

773
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,250
What do you mean? I followed you all this way.

774
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,550
Just come.

775
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,100
All these places are closed.

776
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,170
I know a perfect spot, man.

777
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,350
What is this place?

778
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:42,260
Is this a hidden gem?

779
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,120
Why come all this way to have rice soup?

780
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,110
Gosh, I'm freezing.

781
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,290
What are you waiting for? Say hello to my mom.

782
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,100
- What?
- Mom, say hi. This is my friend.

783
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,100
- Mom? Y-Your mother?
- Yeah.

784
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,880
H-Hello, ma'am.

785
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,500
M-My name is Jo Chang Won. H-Hello.

786
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,490
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, it's nice to meet you, too.

787
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,330
I'm a good friend of Sang Ki.

788
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,740
We eat, get drinks, and do everything together all the time.

789
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,750
- Have a seat.
- Oh, yes, yes.

790
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,610
Come on, feed me already. I'm cold.

791
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:24,020
Thank you. Yes.

792
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,900
Why didn't you tell me? You should've told me sooner!

793
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,680
This place is really good.

794
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,740
It's not my mom's restaurant. She just works part-time here.

795
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,700
- I said, no! I don't want to!
- Come on, just once. Just once.

796
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,100
Let's just do it once.

797
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,140
Goodness, what's with you?

798
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,530
- I want to do it so badly.
- Were you this kind of girl?

799
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:46,970
It's dangerous. No.

800
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,790
How's it dangerous? Let's just do it before the baby gets bigger.

801
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,300
There's no "just once"! We're not doing it!

802
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,810
Okay, wait, wait.

803
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:56,410
You just stay below me. I'll go on top.

804
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:58,550
You're not considerate of me on the bottom.

805
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,470
- Come on!
- I said, no!

806
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,510
- Please!
- Come on!

807
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,620
All right, it's only for one meter. Okay?

808
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,220
- Okay, okay. Just once.
- Seriously, you...

809
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,320
It's like I'm raising a kid already.

810
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,030
- Hey, my neck's bent! Go down!
- Are you okay?

811
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,660
- Gosh, this is so high.
- Are you okay?

812
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,890
Hey, hold on tight. I'm going to try leaning back.

813
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,120
Hey, try moving forward.

814
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,540
- Stop it. Hey!
- Move forward.

815
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,290
Spiderman. Spiderman.

816
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,550
Hey, this is so much fun!

817
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:28,040
- What's so fun about this?
- Gosh, this is so fun.

818
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,210
Quiet, Bae Mun Jeong! The neighbors will complain!

819
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,070
- Hey, too high. You okay? Be careful!
- Let's go. Go, go.

820
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,300
The more I think about it, the more ridiculous this is.

821
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,880
A pregnancy party sounded strange to start with.

822
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,750
Then...

823
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,250
let's call it a first successful collaboration celebration.

824
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,760
First successful collaboration celebration?

825
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,860
That's a mouthful.

826
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,510
So, you've never worked on a case with someone else before?

827
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,610
No, I never needed to since I'm good at my job.

828
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,340
You probably won't need to do that again even into your ninth year.

829
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,840
You're so insistent on saying nine years.

830
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,490
You could've just rounded up to ten.

831
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,840
Because it's been nine years.

832
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:21,750
You performed this song, right?

833
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,050
You remember that?

834
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,060
Shouldn't we have left earlier?

835
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,080
But that dim sum place was a must.

836
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,020
Who knew traffic would be this bad?

837
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,360
But it was good, though. Right?

838
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,800
Yeah, it was pretty good.

839
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,350
But let's hurry.

840
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,110
People would think I'm the one going to work.

841
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,870
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay. Let's go.

842
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,690
Get on my back.

843
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,080
I'm fine.

844
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,800
You said you were covering for a friend's shift.

845
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,390
Come on.

846
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,990
Hold on tight.

847
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,350
Oh, right.

848
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,350
Thank you. I'll head in first.

849
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:34,090
- Okay. Hurry on inside.
- Okay.

850
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,800
When did you start playing piano?

851
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,140
Since I was eight.

852
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,900
Was it always your dream to be a pianist?

853
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,350
Yeah, I think so.

854
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:17,010
My parents loved watching me play the piano.

855
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,370
I loved seeing my parents smile while watching me.

856
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:26,110
So, you played the piano because you liked seeing them smile?

857
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:27,850
That's right.

858
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,370
I think that's why I keep playing.

859
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:35,780
Honestly, I never dreamed of becoming a world-class pianist or anything.

860
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,160
What about you, Ju Hyeong?

861
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,330
Did you always want to be an attorney?

862
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,990
At first, I had a different dream.

863
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:45,270
But I changed my mind as I got older.

864
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:49,100
Why? What made you want to become an attorney?

865
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:53,000
Growing up, I was good at two things.

866
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,960
Arguing and studying.

867
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,970
So, becoming an attorney felt like the natural path.

868
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,420
And?

869
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,000
Do you think you'll become a good attorney?

870
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,460
Yes.

871
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,680
That's my dream.

872
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,970
Wait, is your ankle okay?

873
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,800
Yes, it's gotten much better.

874
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,660
Would you sit down for a minute?

875
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:43,250
Put your foot up here.

876
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,940
It's really fine...

877
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:06,490
Don't you use your right foot to press the pedal?

878
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,840
- That's right.
- You pushed through it.

879
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,690
I don't notice it while playing.

880
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,500
What a professional.

881
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,240
When did you buy this?

882
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:21,360
I ran out quickly as soon as you started playing.

883
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,520
You're good to go now.

884
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:54,960
By the way, this place is really pretty.

885
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,990
Yes, really pretty.

886
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,710
When we're back in Seoul,

887
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:22,660
would you like to go with me if there's another place like this?

888
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,410
Where?

889
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,750
Gangnam Station...

890
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,340
Gangnam Station.

891
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:39,100
Sounds good.

892
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,290
Sounds good.

893
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,820
Sounds good...

894
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,100
So, how did you end up becoming an attorney?

895
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,520
I thought you'd stick with piano.

896
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,880
You don't have to tell me.

897
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,340
No, it's okay.

898
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:11,940
My dad had a business back then as well.

899
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,670
Thanks to that, I could study without worry.

900
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:18,550
But then he got scammed big time.

901
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,710
It was some crypto pyramid scheme.

902
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,880
After that, our family became a mess.

903
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,040
At some point, no one was smiling anymore.

904
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,960
But I couldn't do anything about it.

905
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,330
So, I made up my mind

906
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:41,850
that if anything bad were to happen to my parents again,

907
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,670
I will protect them myself.

908
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:49,440
It must have been very difficult, but it was overcome.

909
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,850
You're right.

910
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,900
My dad is a really strong person.

911
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,970
No, I'm talking about you, Kang Hui Ji.

912
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,760
Me?

913
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,840
Not everyone comes out of that thinking like you do.

914
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,650
You overcame it well.

915
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,430
You did well.

916
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,180
You're right.

917
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,580
I did pretty well.

918
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:18,120
Everything's okay now.

919
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,960
I just want my parents to stay happy.

920
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,740
That's my dream.

921
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,780
Your dream hasn't changed in 10 years.

922
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,870
Did I say this 10 years ago, too?

923
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,580
You really don't remember anything.

924
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,450
I mean, I remember your dream.

925
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:38,140
It was to become a good attorney.

926
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,470
You've accomplished your dream.

927
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:49,350
I can't say I became a good attorney.

928
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,610
Why not? You're a good attorney.

929
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,210
You listen to people in need

930
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:56,810
and help them fight back.

931
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,240
Honestly, I don't think of it as helping them.

932
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,670
Based on what I can see,

933
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,840
I just get paid to fight on their behalf.

934
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,140
If being a good attorney means going beyond that,

935
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,970
then I'm not.

936
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,350
Still,

937
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:27,050
you're a good attorney senior to me.

938
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,170
And a good person.

939
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,390
Thank you.

940
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,820
Don't you usually take the subway to work only

941
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,820
and take the bus home?

942
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,850
Yes, since the subway runs on time.

943
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:00,220
And the bus goes straight to my house.

944
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,750
This way leads to the subway. The bus is that way.

945
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,480
I know.

946
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:33,280
You're heading back tomorrow, right?

947
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,910
Yes.

948
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,940
Shall we head inside?

949
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

950
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:19,170
♫  In a sea of unfamiliar lights  ♫

951
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:29,100
♫  You stood out, shining so brightly  ♫

952
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:35,100
♫  What began as coincidence  ♫

953
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:44,400
♫  I hope we are meant to be wrapped in fate  ♫

954
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:54,300
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

955
01:17:54,300 --> 01:18:00,700
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

956
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:10,390
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

957
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:19,440
♫  That it was nice to meet you, and I liked you  ♫

958
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:28,250
♫  You and I from back then, if we ever meet again  ♫

959
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:34,430
♫  I want to say to you  ♫

960
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:42,710
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

961
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:49,120
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

962
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:58,780
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

963
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:07,150
♫  That it was nice to meet you, and I liked you  ♫

964
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:18,020
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

965
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:26,030
♫  Though you may not want to hear this  ♫

966
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:34,250
♫  These are the words I've kept in my heart  ♫

♫  That's not why I cried  ♫|

969
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:04,740
♫  It's just that everything felt so unfamiliar  ♫

970
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:10,500
♫  At the end of time that arrived before we knew it  ♫

971
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,340
The girl you met on your trip while in law school—

972
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,480
What? You two were like that?

973
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,510
Ever since Hong Kong, Ju Hyeong and Attorney Kang—

974
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,910
Hey, Mun Jeong is looking for you.

975
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,760
If you're drunk, hurry up and go home.

976
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,730
A voice phishing case?

977
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,460
They said they'd make a special exception to get me a loan.

978
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:32,100
This would normally be an easy case to defend...

979
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,980
Where do you get this?

980
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,780
This must be really hard for you.

981
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:39,020
So, do your families all ask why you're not getting married?

982
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,570
Gosh, that scared me!

983
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,430
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

984
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:45,260
- Yes.
- When was your favorite moment?

985
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,350
Right now?

986
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,410
♫  Let's greet each other with a smile  ♫

987
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:57,680
♫  Hi, today is a good day for me  ♫
