2
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,200
Hi.

3
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,080
Oh? What brings you here?

4
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,990
You didn't even call.

5
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,440
Why do you look so startled?

6
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,320
Were you watching something naughty together?

7
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,990
You should've called before coming.

8
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,880
Did you eat dinner?

9
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
Probably not.

10
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,950
- Go and wash your hands.
- Okay.

11
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,510
- Want some snacks?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,420
Snacks? You'll lose your appetite.

13
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,650
Eat dinner first.

14
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,680
Did I tell you I became a chairman?

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,950
What? Chairman of what?

16
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,800
Some business friends and I started a volunteer organization.

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,900
- The chairman of that.
- Whoa...

18
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,000
There he goes bragging about useless things.

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,630
You asked to meet,

20
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,470
but you're not saying anything. Just like old times.

21
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,960
Was I like this before, too?

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,390
Yeah, when we broke up.

23
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,540
Why did you want to see me?

24
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,010
The trial's over.

25
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,840
Just because...

26
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,950
It's been a while since I saw you, An Ju Hyeong,

27
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,600
but I don't think I actually got to talk to you.

28
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,830
Have you been well?

29
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,550
Yeah.

30
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,090
I've been doing well, as you can tell.

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,290
I haven't been well, as you know.

32
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm sorry... about the trial.

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,420
That was the best I could do.

34
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,300
I thought it'd be good to end it quickly.

35
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,680
I know.

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,360
Ending it fast was the right thing to do.

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,590
For my sake as well.

38
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,840
After how I had hurt you...

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,300
I totally deserve this, don't I?

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,250
No.

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,180
I didn't think that.

42
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,790
I did think it would've been better if we hadn't met

43
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,250
under such circumstances.

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,460
If we had met under different circumstances,

45
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,530
you wouldn't have even talked to me.

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,690
Park Su Jeong,

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,110
be well.

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,590
That's what I came to say.

49
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,970
I used to really like this side of you.

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,100
Yeah.

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,110
I came to say goodbye, too.

52
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,530
Yeah.

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
Let's not see each other again.

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,170
Especially like this.

55
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,620
If something really great happens to you down the line,

56
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,140
just send me a text or something.

57
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,930
I'll be fine.

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,690
Thanks.

59
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,290
Excuse me.

60
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,180
An Ju Hyeong left already.

61
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,230
You should leave now.

62
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,810
Could you come out for a second?

63
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,260
Well, I asked to see you because—

64
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,630
Let me speak first.

65
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,530
I turned Park Su Jeong away.

66
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,300
When I went down after what happened yesterday,

67
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,140
she was waiting downstairs.

68
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,790
And I ended up telling her you had already left.

69
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,110
I crossed the line.

70
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,630
I'm sorry. I should've told you right away yesterday.

71
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,710
W-Why... did you do that?

72
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah, why did I do that...

73
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,100
I guess I didn't want you to get hurt.

74
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,800
I didn't think it'd be good for you to see her in that state.

75
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,930
That's why I did it.

76
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,010
You could get hurt needlessly

77
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,890
for something that's already in the past...

78
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,370
I mean, maybe not for you, I suppose.

79
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,470
So... what I'm trying to say is...

80
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,850
It is in the past.

81
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,290
You were right.

82
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,470
Taking that case was stupid.

83
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,000
I didn't feel at ease with it.

84
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,900
But I'm really okay now.

85
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,940
I wanted to tell you that.

86
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,500
So... you don't have to feel sorry.

87
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,940
I noticed you didn't have any emergency snacks last time,

88
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,360
so I just bought some for you while buying...

89
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,930
buying mine...

90
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,490
Thank you.

91
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,820
Please insert your card.

92
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,270
Choose your transaction.

93
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,580
Reading your card.

94
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,020
Enter the recipient's account number

95
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,820
and press confirm.

96
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,290
Enter the amount

97
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,220
and press confirm.

98
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,570
Transaction complete.

99
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,900
- What the...
- You scared me!

100
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,440
How come you have so much money? You don't spend your salary?

101
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Gosh, why did you sneak a peek at my account?

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,820
I'll sue you, I swear.

103
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,330
Sue me? Are we strangers?

104
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,770
- Security!
- Security!

105
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,920
- We have a problem here.
- There's no problem.

106
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,890
- We have a problem here, security!
- No problem at all.

107
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,640
This is good.

108
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,230
Let's have lunch here again in two Tuesdays from now.

109
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,250
Dip it in the salted shrimp. That's the best.

110
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,340
I'll eat it how I want, okay?

111
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,520
And who dips chili peppers in salted shrimp?

112
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,610
Oh, right.

113
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,140
He's filthy rich. No joke.

114
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,940
It's fake news. Fake news.

115
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,530
It's not fake news.

116
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,240
Why do you still live there when you're so rich?

117
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,380
You should move now.

118
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,270
Did Old Man secretly save up that much money?

119
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,430
How is that secretly?

120
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,220
And I'm not that rich.

121
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,050
But why is Senior Sang Ki called Old Man?

122
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,350
- He acts like one, don't you think?
- Come on!

123
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,590
Not at all. He's an absolute fox.

124
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,090
What was your original nickname?

125
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,060
You probably had one in school.

126
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,300
I was "Spirit of Spring."

127
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,350
Was that supposed to be funny?

128
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,340
It wasn't funny, nor was it touching

129
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,150
or thought provoking.

130
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,870
Hey, you pay for all this.

131
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,210
You're not funny, but you're rich.

132
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,800
- You're crossing the line.
- Hey, aren't you richer, though?

133
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,700
That's my dad's money, not mine.

134
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,390
Your dad is rich?

135
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,820
My dad may be the CEO of a small, high-potential SME,

136
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,360
but he's not that rich.

137
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,350
He made some money as Hanguk Group's subcontractor.

138
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,440
If not for that, he would've gone under already.

139
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,850
How many times do I have to tell you?

140
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,310
I've never heard that before.

141
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,270
In any case, it's all your money in the end, Mr. Only Child.

142
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,810
I'm sick of that "only child" stuff.

143
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,810
Do you want to go up against the 6 million "only child" out there?

144
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,520
And you guys are all doing pretty well.

145
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,660
Who says?

146
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,330
You guys all graduated from law school.

147
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,760
Gosh, that's a dangerous comment.

148
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,300
Not everyone's well-off like you.

149
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,580
Others mistake us as such, but you know that's not the case for us.

150
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,880
Why are you getting so serious, Mr. Big Savings Account?

151
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,840
Geez, why did you have to bring up money?

152
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,000
You did, Attorney Jo.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,280
Yeah, I was talking to myself.

154
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,590
This damn mouth of mine.

155
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,580
My mouth is the problem.

156
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,550
Your symptoms haven't improved.

157
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,640
I couldn't take the meds you prescribed because I got pregnant.

158
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,070
Really? Congratulations.

159
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,020
Your husband must've been thrilled.

160
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm not sure yet…

161
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,860
I don't know if it's something to celebrate.

162
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,280
Then, I'll prescribe something safe for pregnancy.

163
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,210
Retail investors are idiots.

164
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,860
As soon as the price goes up a little,

165
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,860
they swarm in like rabid dogs.

166
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,500
Are you talking about me?

167
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,020
- You were a retail investor?
- Yes, of course!

168
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,820
Oh, shit.

169
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,170
That's hilarious.

170
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,930
Sorry about that.

171
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,950
- Anyway...
- Yeah?

172
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,460
As soon as trading resumes, we dump all our shares.

173
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,470
But these retail investors just gobble them up.

174
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,280
So, we make capital gains,

175
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,570
while that stock plummets into penny-stock territory.

176
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,960
Then, we do another capital reduction, rake in capital gains,

177
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,430
and repeat this cycle until the company gets delisted.

178
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,730
So, that's how I lost my money.

179
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,000
It seems like all my money went to you.

180
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,500
Do you want to partner up when I get out?

181
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,040
I'll make you rich.

182
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,250
I appreciate the thought, but I'll pass.

183
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,750
If I'm meant to make money, it'll come my way.

184
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,540
Otherwise, I'll lose my license.

185
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,070
What will you do with your precious attorney license?

186
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,560
Dammit, you're just here as an errand boy to chat with me.

187
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,740
I get to run my mouth and get paid for it.

188
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,190
I'd say that's a win.

189
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,990
Don't you think?

190
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,500
- You're totally nuts, huh?
- Huh?

191
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,410
This is why I like you, Attorney.

192
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,500
Thank you.

193
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,030
Mr. Seong,

194
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,740
how long do I have to go on these visitations?

195
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,450
Do you know how much we're being paid for those visitations?

196
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,110
If you can bring in that much business, I'll tell you.

197
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,870
Or...

198
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,750
if you get your father's company to sign an advisory retainer,

199
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,070
I'll take you off the visitation case.

200
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,130
- Never mind.
- The trial won't take long, so just keep doing it.

201
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,160
You don't have to go every day. Maybe every other day.

202
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,880
Okay, I understand.

203
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,910
Isn't this easier for you anyway?

204
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,220
You just go and hang out.

205
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,770
If I were you, I'd say, "Thank you very much" and be on my way.

206
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,500
This isn't theft. It's technically misappropriation of lost property.

207
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,310
I honestly don't remember anything.

208
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,750
Did you drink a lot that night?

209
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,770
My job-hunting wasn't going well,

210
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,440
so I went out with some friends to blow off steam.

211
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,110
I guess I went overboard.

212
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,010
Do you remember going to the convenience store?

213
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,700
I don't remember that, either,

214
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,290
but when I get drunk, I usually go there to grab one last beer.

215
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,280
So, I probably went there, but...

216
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,880
the police say the CCTV footage shows

217
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,830
that I took the watch that was there.

218
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,630
But if you took it, it should be at your house.

219
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,300
But there's nothing.

220
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,750
That's what's driving me crazy.

221
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,500
If it were at home, I could at least apologize and say

222
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,790
I mistakenly took it while drunk.

223
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,100
But that's not the case.

224
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,000
Then, at the police interview, don't accept the charges.

225
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Just tell them honestly that you don't remember anything.

226
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,960
But what if they think I'm lying and punish me more harshly?

227
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,180
During the police investigation,

228
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,660
they may or may not show you the CCTV footage.

229
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,000
If you say you don't remember, they'll probably show you video evidence.

230
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,970
It's not too late to admit guilt, then.

231
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,360
I really didn't hit them.

232
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,870
In over 10 years of teaching,

233
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,930
I've never used corporal punishment.

234
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,940
Are these the students' names?

235
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,790
No, they filed the complaint under the parents' names.

236
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,080
Then, do you know which kids filed the complaint?

237
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,650
Yes, I know who they are.

238
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,070
They were using the gym after school without permission,

239
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,350
so I scolded them.

240
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,550
A few days later, I got a call from the police,

241
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,140
saying I was being sued for child abuse.

242
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,900
But are seventh graders even considered children?

243
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,950
Yes, anyone under 18 is considered a child.

244
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,290
So, you're saying you only gave them a warning

245
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,320
and didn't physically discipline them. Right?

246
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,710
Yes.

247
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,750
But it says you made them get into the push-up position

248
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,320
and hit their bottoms.

249
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,470
I never did that.

250
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,350
When the police called me,

251
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,070
I wondered if I'd been too harsh with my words.

252
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,550
But when I read the complaint,

253
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,360
I was shocked by their claims.

254
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,690
I only scold students verbally.

255
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,790
Gently.

256
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,250
I see. Could you tell me the students' names?

257
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,200
I feel like they'll be on here...

258
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,270
Geez, I told you to knock!

259
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,407
Do you have a Newstagram account?

260
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:17,306
Huh?

261
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:19,500
Why don't you create your own account and check?

262
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,380
Why are you making me do it?

263
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,720
It's a hassle. I don't know the system, either.

264
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,400
And who has the time to read all the terms and conditions?

265
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,870
- Why would you read that?
- That's how you sign up.

266
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,900
Who knows what might be included there?

267
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,360
You're nuts.

268
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,740
Hwang Min Gu.

269
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,800
He really didn't hit them, right?

270
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,480
So, what now?

271
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,840
Ride the wave.

272
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,310
What?

273
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,530
You know, "Friend-of-a-friend" feature. Wave surfing.

274
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,060
Friend-of-a-friend...

275
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,930
It's not "Wave." It's "Follow."

276
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,430
But I don't think those kids would've followed him.

277
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,180
Try Kim Sang Jun.

278
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,830
Nothing.

279
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,900
Nothing.

280
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,950
There's nothing.

281
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,770
Nothing. Damn it.

282
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,350
Then...

283
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,200
Then,

284
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,540
we can try this.

285
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,760
First, let's look for a student from this school.

286
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,180
Teacher, let's go here for our next school picnic.

287
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,640
_yea.na14.

288
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,090
She's probably in seventh grade.

289
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,520
Gosh, how should we respond?

290
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,420
There doesn't seem to be...

291
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,610
any boys on here.

292
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,460
She seems popular.

293
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,090
There are boys on here.

294
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,120
Joo An?

295
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,920
These are boys' profiles.

296
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,950
Wait.

297
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,870
- sangjuuun_kim?
- Kim Sang Jun.

298
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,610
Is this him?

299
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,630
I found him.

300
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,070
If you mess with us, you're done for.

301
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,300
How dare you nag us?

302
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,660
Bye-bye, Mr. Min Gu.

303
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,670
That's what you get for mouthing off.

304
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,740
Goodness.

305
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,860
eeeeminhyuk and others liked this post.

306
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,710
Lee Min Hyuk, Im Gi Hun... It's them, right?

307
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,560
Lee Min Hyeok, Im Gi Hun, Jang Seong Bin...

308
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,520
It is them.

309
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,740
Damn it, you found them.

310
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,010
- Yeah.
- Geez...

311
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,640
Then, I have to actually visit.

312
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,170
Do you want to come with me?

313
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,950
I'm leaving. Damn it...

314
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,980
Fighting.

315
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,160
Pass! Pass! Hey, pass!

316
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,590
Kim Sang Jun,

317
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,750
Lee Min Hyeok,

318
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,020
Im Gi Hun,

319
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,620
let's see... Jang Seong Bin,

320
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,210
and Kang Jae Ho.

321
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,170
Now that I see your faces, it is you guys.

322
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,370
Who are you, mister?

323
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,030
You're not allowed in here.

324
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,870
The same goes for you guys.

325
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,280
Kim Sang Jun, are you the ringleader?

326
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,590
How do you know my name?

327
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,840
You guys falsely accused Mr. Hwang Min Gu, right?

328
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,600
That's not true. We filed charges because he really did hit us.

329
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,720
Give me a second.

330
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
If you mess with us, you're done for.

331
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,560
How dare you nag us?

332
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,790
Bye-bye, Mr. Min Gu.

333
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,890
That's what you get for mouthing off.

334
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,290
Guys,

335
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,270
if you're going to commit a crime, you can't be dumb.

336
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,690
If you're this sloppy now, what will you do later?

337
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,940
You can't prove that our claims are lies with just that.

338
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,370
Well, you see, I don't have to prove that.

339
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,740
I just have to demonstrate that there's

340
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,300
reasonable doubt that Mr. Hwang hit you.

341
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,610
Even harsh words are a form of verbal punishment.

342
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,190
Then, you should've filed charges on that.

343
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,700
Why did you say he made you get into the push-up position and hit your bottom?

344
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,400
The gym was made for students to use. So, they should allow it.

345
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,490
Forbidding us from using it is unfair.

346
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,000
Then, you should've submitted a formal complaint

347
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,800
through the appropriate agency.

348
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,440
You can't make a false accusation. That's a serious crime.

349
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,660
What's that?

350
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,820
We're juveniles.

351
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,230
Oh, juveniles...

352
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,310
Then, you should've filed the charges under your names.

353
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,780
Why did you file under your parents' names and make them criminals?

354
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,730
And juveniles still get tried in juvenile court.

355
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,340
Community service, probation,

356
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,900
placement in custodial care, or put in a juvenile center.

357
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,830
Though I'm not sure which sentence you'll receive yet.

358
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,360
How did you even find my account?

359
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,710
There's no way you found that out yourself.

360
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,230
Why do you think that?

361
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,810
You don't look like you'd even know what Newstagram is.

362
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,020
That's harsh.

363
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you guys know "Friend-of-a-friend" surfing?

364
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,270
- What's that?
- Don't know.

365
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,020
It's winter. Why would we go surfing?

366
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,950
I know. This guy is weird.

367
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,760
I know.

368
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,600
Saying you don't remember won't cut it.

369
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,190
He's not just saying that. He really doesn't remember.

370
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,240
You can't answer for him, Attorney.

371
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,810
You know that.

372
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,100
I really don't remember, and there's nothing at my house, either.

373
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,420
Then, I'll show you the CCTV footage.

374
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,440
Watch it and tell me how much you recall.

375
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,520
Both of you, come here.

376
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,210
Here.

377
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,720
The victim leaves the convenience store.

378
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,110
You see the small shopping bag in his right hand?

379
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,020
Are you saying the watch was in there?

380
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,700
Yes.

381
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,360
But shortly after, Moon Dong Geun enters the store.

382
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,020
Then, the victim suddenly gets up and leaves,

383
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,590
forgetting the shopping bag.

384
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,030
Then, Moon Dong Geun comes out and sits there.

385
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,640
Okay. Then, Moon Dong Geun gets up and leaves, too.

386
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,730
Soon after, the victim comes back.

387
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,350
But by then, the shopping bag is gone.

388
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,100
And he immediately reports it to the police.

389
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,130
You were the only person there during that time, Moon Dong Geun.

390
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,920
I can only conclude that you took the bag in your backpack.

391
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,230
But the footage doesn't show the exact spot.

392
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,840
Attorney, you saw the shopping bag sitting there. Right?

393
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,310
Did anyone come by during that time besides Moon Dong Geun?

394
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,740
I mean, how can you refute this?

395
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,380
Yeah, Mom. I just finished my interview.

396
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,900
Well, I don't know.

397
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,710
Yeah, I ate.

398
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,060
Yeah.

399
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,930
Okay, hang up. Okay.

400
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,290
I told her I was going to a job interview.

401
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,080
That convenience store is nearby, right?

402
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,720
What are you looking for?

403
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,650
When CCTV cameras are installed, they must be reported.

404
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,620
The police probably only had footage from reported CCTV cameras.

405
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,050
If reporting is mandatory,

406
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,360
that means there could be CCTVs that weren't reported.

407
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,970
That teacher is ridiculous.

408
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,930
How could he hire an attorney as if he's in the right?

409
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,490
The same goes for you. You're an attorney.

410
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,770
How could you go visit the kids and do that?

411
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,210
I mean, if you met the kids, that should be enough.

412
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,590
Why are you making us come in as well?

413
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,090
Because you're the plaintiffs.

414
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,590
Neither the teacher nor the attorney acts like a proper adult.

415
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,840
So, what do you want to say to us?

416
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,180
We're all busy people.

417
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,350
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

418
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,550
I'm Attorney Bae Mun Jeong of Hyungmin Law Group.

419
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,400
- What's up?
- You look outnumbered.

420
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,700
So what will you do? Will you maintain the charges?

421
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,420
They said they were hit because they were.

422
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,590
Why would they say that if they weren't hit?

423
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,250
And what? False accusation?

424
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,960
Do you have evidence?

425
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,590
I don't think you'd be able to prove it.

426
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,970
You're Im Gi Hun's father, right?

427
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,010
Yes. How did you know that?

428
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,630
You're saying the same thing your son did.

429
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,590
You can't prove that our claims are lies with just that.

430
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,750
The kids have all admitted to it now,

431
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,860
but if the parents keep playing ignorant,

432
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,790
we'll have to consider ways to hold you all accountable.

433
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,870
The kids lied. Why are you holding us responsible? Huh?

434
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,810
None of us knew this was a false accusation!

435
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,460
- This was the kids' doing!
- We didn't know!

436
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,990
Seriously!

437
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,620
I asked my relative, who is a chief prosecutor,

438
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,860
and he said if I didn't know, I wouldn't be punished.

439
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,290
So, you're saying it's your kid's fault, not yours. Right?

440
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,810
Yes.

441
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,180
Have you heard of this saying?

442
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,010
"Law is the minimum standard of morality."

443
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,550
There's this in civil law.

444
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,890
It's called supervisory responsibility.

445
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,860
Parents of minors

446
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,260
have a legal responsibility as supervisors.

447
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,390
That's the minimum duty as a parent.

448
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,500
But you say that kids did it, and you didn't know?

449
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,240
If you won't take ethical responsibility as parents,

450
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,750
then you must bear legal responsibility as supervisors.

451
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,360
Oh my.

452
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,520
Then, what can we do to make this better?

453
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,420
Since you're attorneys, give us some advice.

454
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,660
We are attorneys for Mr. Hwang Min Gu.

455
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,350
We're not the plaintiffs' counsel.

456
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,910
First, you should drop the lawsuit.

457
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,850
After that, it's up to what Mr. Hwang decides.

458
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,810
What would you like to do?

459
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,510
Hey, why did you get so worked up today?

460
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,950
You scared me.

461
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,610
I couldn't stand the sight of them showing up in droves

462
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,580
without realizing they were in the wrong.

463
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,950
We have to live with our heads on straight

464
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,390
so we don't become parents like that.

465
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,740
So, what time and where should we meet later?

466
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,790
I'll send you a text.

467
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,110
- Should we call Kang Hui Ji, too?
- Sure. I'll tell her.

468
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,380
You tell Ji Seok.

469
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,380
You do it. He's your husband.

470
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,120
He's your friend, Attorney.

471
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,130
I'm Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

472
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,610
Geez, I still can't let you. No.

473
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,180
We'll just check that brief time slot.

474
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,080
You're an attorney. Don't you know the law?

475
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,770
We can't just show stuff like this without the police.

476
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,880
No, if the person in the footage requests it,

477
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,740
you have to show it.

478
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,740
Gosh, seriously.

479
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,490
I feel strange telling you this since we just met.

480
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,420
But I have a criminal record.

481
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,190
So, I'm trying my best to live within the legal boundaries.

482
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,670
So, talk to the police,

483
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,740
and if they say to show it to you, I will.

484
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,450
Otherwise, I can't. You got that?

485
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,870
Please leave.

486
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,320
Sir!

487
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,490
What should we do, Attorney?

488
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,060
Are you sure the watch isn't at your house?

489
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,450
Yes.

490
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,830
Then, let's check this with the police.

491
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,170
But what if...

492
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,450
we check the footage,

493
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,640
and it turns out I really did take it?

494
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,380
- It doesn't smell much.
- It does.

495
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,760
I washed it in the washing machine.

496
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,170
Anyway...

497
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,980
- Fine. Good job. Smells like it.
- Really?

498
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,690
Please get us another glass.

499
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,270
Hui Ji can't make it.

500
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,460
Seems she's busy with work.

501
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,240
Oh, really?

502
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

503
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,740
You never ask for favors.

504
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,660
Why did you call me out in the middle of the night?

505
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,680
That's why I'm buying dinner now.

506
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,200
You live close by anyway.

507
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,740
Exactly. I told you to visit since I live nearby,

508
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,630
but you never came once.

509
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,920
Drinking with you is no fun.

510
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,070
It's no fun at all.

511
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,740
Y-You're... funny...

512
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,500
Outrageous.

513
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,230
Why aren't you eating much today?

514
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,590
What? I just don't have much of an appetite.

515
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,490
Really? What in the world?

516
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,630
Hey, did you hear from Ju Hwan?

517
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,290
He said he's being sued, so I gave him your number.

518
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,940
Yeah, I said I'd handle it.

519
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,700
You did? That's not like you.

520
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,270
You don't handle cases for people you know.

521
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,550
Yeah. We're not close. I only know his name.

522
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,500
Do you tell people that you're close to me?

523
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,980
I don't tell people we're close, but don't cause any trouble.

524
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,400
I won't take your case.

525
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,760
My wife's an attorney. Why would I ask you? Right?

526
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,250
I'd be glad if he's even capable of causing trouble.

527
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,990
No fun.

528
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,890
Both of you are hurting me as a tag team.

529
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,250
Hey, haven't you been on any blind dates lately?

530
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,270
I'm busy.

531
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,470
What do you mean you're busy?

532
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,110
You even went to the school to meet those kids!

533
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,540
I went for work, not for fun.

534
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,120
School? Why would he go to a school?

535
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,480
Well, there were these kids

536
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,170
who falsely accused a teacher of corporal punishment.

537
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,880
Whoa, scary. So scary.

538
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
It's too scary to raise kids these days.

539
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,170
So, did it get resolved?

540
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,980
Yeah, I think so.

541
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,920
It's a relief.

542
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,640
What are you relieved about?

543
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,810
Well, it means my client wasn't a bad person.

544
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,400
Why is that important to you?

545
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,160
I'd prefer my client to be a good person.

546
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,590
Who are you?

547
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,890
Who are you? Are you ill?

548
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,460
- He's weird.
- He's always been weird.

549
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,690
He's weirder today.

550
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,540
I think you're right.

551
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,180
I'm so full.

552
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,420
Thanks for dinner.

553
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,520
- Thanks for dinner.
- See you.

554
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,500
It's such a relief that my client isn't a bad person.

555
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,810
I'd prefer him to be a good person.

556
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,420
I'd prefer my client to be a good person.

557
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,200
Gosh, seriously.

558
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,770
Attorney.

559
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,290
Do you want me to tell you something interesting?

560
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,810
- What is it?
- Do you know why

561
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,870
my dad assigned you to me?

562
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,760
Well, to keep you company, I suppose.

563
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,310
I'm telling you, you're so funny.

564
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,530
You're so naive.

565
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,680
He assigned you to keep an eye on me.

566
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,350
In case I'd rat that old man out.

567
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,440
- Pardon?
- Where do you think I got the money?

568
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,890
It's all that old man's.

569
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,200
But he's such a scaredy-cat.

570
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,400
Why would I rat out my dad? I'll be out soon anyway.

571
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,130
I've looked at the case records.

572
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,590
It doesn't look like you'll be out anytime soon.

573
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,100
Do you want to bet? Whether I get out soon or not?

574
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,960
I shouldn't be telling anyone about this.

575
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,010
It's a multi-million won tip.

576
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,370
You see, the stock-manipulation cases

577
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,620
are about to whom the unjust gain—

578
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,640
No, never mind.

579
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,730
When I get out, do you want to work for me?

580
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,670
I'll tell you then.

581
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,460
I mean, you're already getting paid to hang out with me.

582
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,510
You can stop pretending to be an attorney

583
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,610
and just play with me while working for me.

584
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,600
I think that would be fun.

585
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,980
Why on earth would I work for you, Jang Su Gil?

586
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,780
What's with that look?

587
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,990
Does glaring at me with prideful eyes make things better?

588
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,950
Why would I assert my pride in front of a lowlife like you?

589
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,330
You're not getting out. Not in 10 or 20 years. Got that, asshole?

590
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,220
You can't even get out of here. What the...

591
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,760
Who the hell are you to tell me to work for you?

592
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,970
If I'm a lowlife,

593
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,180
what does that make you, coming here to keep me entertained?

594
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,130
You'll be back here in a few days anyway.

595
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,550
Don't assert your pride.

596
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,900
It'll only eat you up inside.

597
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,260
Thank you, Attorney.

598
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,400
I'll do my best to teach the kids well.

599
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,080
- A girl you're flirting with?
- Geez, you scared me.

600
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,840
- Why smile while reading a text?
- You're wrong.

601
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,700
Let's go.

602
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,550
- Is it really a girl you're flirting with?
- No, no. Let's go.

603
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,800
Enjoy your meal.

604
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,960
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

605
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,030
What are you having?

606
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,520
We'll have Chinese spicy soup.

607
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,740
Chinese spicy soup sounds good.

608
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,320
What are we having?

609
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm not sure.

610
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,140
Hey, are you heading out to eat?

611
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,380
Of course.

612
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,980
Aren't we eating together?

613
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,940
I think I'll have to eat separately today.

614
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,470
You didn't say that in the group chat.

615
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,260
Why argue about it? She must have something to do.

616
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,450
- I mean...
- An Ju Hyeong.

617
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,240
I have a life, too.

618
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,400
- I'll get going.
- Okay, see you later.

619
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,300
- Make sure to eat.
- Okay!

620
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
What is it?

621
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,250
As I thought...

622
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,420
What?

623
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,660
Naengmyeon* sounds good.
(Cold noodles with vinegar*, also used to mean jealousy)

624
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,200
- Okay, naengmyeon.
- Today's a naengmyeon day.

625
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,220
Yeah, naengmyeon.

626
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,030
Enjoy your meal.

627
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,650
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

628
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,380
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

629
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,420
Yes, thank you. Come again.

630
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,510
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

631
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,620
Sir, the black bean noodles are really good.

632
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,360
Our black soybean paste sauce isn't just any black soybean paste.

633
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,550
But I still can't show you the CCTV footage.

634
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,700
I'll only check the part with my client. That'll be enough.

635
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,000
I've explained enough already. Bring the police with you.

636
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,960
Gosh, this is tasty.

637
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,170
Thank you.

638
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,340
- Hey, pull that in a bit.
- Gosh, seriously.

639
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,180
Nice. That's good.

640
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,350
But who eats cold noodles in the middle of winter?

641
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,160
It's originally a cold region dish.

642
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,550
I bet people there don't eat cold noodles in the winter.

643
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,680
You don't even drink iced Americanos when it's cold, but you'll eat this?

644
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,280
Mun Jeong strongly wanted to eat it.

645
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,240
She always strongly wants to eat.

646
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,830
Then, why didn't you order beef short rib soup?

647
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,530
Why do you always complain every time we eat?

648
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,700
How can I get beef short rib soup when everyone is having cold noodles?

649
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,680
That's true.

650
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,470
One order of cold noodles with broth for this table.

651
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,270
Yes, yes.

652
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,210
Hello?

653
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,450
Yeah, Hyung.

654
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,760
Yeah, I'm part of Hyungmin Law Group.

655
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,620
Kang Hui Ji?

656
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,450
Yeah, I know Hui Ji well. Why?

657
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,820
Hey, I called you to stop this attorney from coming here.

658
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,830
- But you come with her?
- What's wrong?

659
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,440
It's nice to see you again.

660
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,950
You two must be really close.

661
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,740
- I'm a regular here.
- He always brings girls here to impress them.

662
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,970
That's how he became a regular.

663
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,800
Hyung! Why would you say that? She'll misunderstand!

664
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,260
Huh? Why are you getting flustered? Trying to impress her?

665
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,670
What are you saying? This guy's weird.

666
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,640
But how do you impress girls here?

667
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,100
Well, you see...

668
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,850
- That's a trade secret.
- What a load of crap.

669
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,530
I can't let you see it.

670
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,590
But since you came with Chang Won, enjoy your meal.

671
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,890
I'll give you cream shrimp on the house.

672
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,790
Thank you. I'll come often.

673
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

674
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,060
- See you later.
- See you.

675
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,150
Goodness, sorry for the wait.

676
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,430
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

677
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,800
This is good.

678
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,500
They're really making me uncomfortable.

679
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,410
It's burned.

680
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,480
If you burn it like this, I can't post a picture.

681
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,550
- I mean—
- Leave that one out.

682
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,510
It got burned because I was waiting for you.

683
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,950
This one doesn't look tasty, either.

684
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,020
- Put a new one on for me. Just one.
- Okay, okay.

685
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,940
- A new one. Nice.
- It's frozen.

686
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,550
The lighting's good. Got it.

687
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,780
- You're good now?
- Okay, okay.

688
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,730
Oops, my bad.

689
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,730
- Is this revenge?
- I'm eating the burned ones for you.

690
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,510
All right.

691
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,890
Here's your fried rice.

692
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,850
All right, enjoy your meal.

693
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,120
Don't smile.

694
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,250
Come on.

695
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,860
I think it'd work with one more visit.

696
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,210
Right? With one more visit, we might throw up.

697
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,150
Gosh, this damn convenience store table.

698
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,280
Why did he have to leave it here?

699
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,750
Still, you're such a hard worker.

700
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,260
Sorry for dragging you into this.

701
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,700
Oh, no.

702
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,110
Following you makes me feel like I'm working hard,

703
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,120
so it's fun. I like it.

704
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,410
Really?

705
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,750
Then, does this seem like interesting work?

706
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,940
You said you wanted to do something exciting and worthwhile.

707
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:42,570
Well, it seems way better than my work.

708
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,530
I guess being an attorney doesn't suit me.

709
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,220
Why not? You're the most energetic guy at our firm.

710
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,030
I'm only enjoying myself because you guys are there.

711
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:57,090
The job itself... I'm not sure about it.

712
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,330
Still, if you don't want to be an attorney,

713
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,130
you could always inherit your dad's business.

714
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,390
Gosh, seriously.

715
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,820
That's my dad's company, not mine.

716
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

717
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,870
What about you? You said your dad also runs a business.

718
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,880
Yeah.

719
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,770
Just a moment.

720
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,670
Yeah, Dad.

721
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,220
No, I didn't forget. We talked about it last time.

722
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,850
Oh, next Friday?

723
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,440
Got it.

724
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Okay.

725
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,280
What is it? Something happening next Friday?

726
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,900
Yeah. My parents' memorial service.

727
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,230
What?

728
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,380
What? What's the matter?

729
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:42,730
I mean, just now on the phone,

730
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,260
didn't you call him "D-Dad"?

731
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,960
Yeah, I was talking to my dad.

732
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,010
Then, it's your mom's memorial?

733
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,090
No, for both of my parents.

734
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,650
What?

735
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,900
My parents passed away when I was seven.

736
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,330
My aunt and uncle raised me.

737
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:04,180
So, my uncle is now my dad.

738
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,000
I see.

739
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,100
Then...

740
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:17,640
your dad, who runs a business, is the uncle you were just talking to...

741
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,380
No, no, I mean, he's your dad.

742
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,980
Wait, no. You said your dad passed away,

743
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,410
so...

744
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,300
It's really difficult, right? You don't have to say anything.

745
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,960
No, I feel like...

746
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,810
I should still s-say something.

747
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,350
No, no, just be quiet.

748
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,580
- Can I?
- Yeah, just stay still.

749
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,630
I'm fine.

750
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,980
Thanks.

751
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,500
We've narrowed down to five scholarship recipients this year.

752
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,730
Four 12th graders and one exam retaker.

753
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,410
This student's family income fluctuates every year.

754
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,000
Let's do another background check to make sure

755
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,500
they didn't under-report before making a final decision.

756
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,790
Yes, understood.

757
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,930
Executive Director, Lee Dong Su, one of the first-year recipients...

758
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,700
Him again?

759
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,290
What about the victim?

760
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,790
They haven't hired an attorney yet, right?

761
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,110
Yes, it seems they are representing themselves.

762
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,330
Should we pay the victim for their legal fees again?

763
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,370
No.

764
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,750
This time, let's not just pay for their attorney fees.

765
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,080
Let's bring them here.

766
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,150
This is the Hyungmin Law Group, after all.

767
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,960
We'll have the attorneys here represent them.

768
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,920
I've always wanted to do that once I opened my own firm.

769
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,950
Okay, understood.

770
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,890
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Welcome—

771
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,920
Gosh, seriously.

772
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,400
I'm so sick and tired of this.

773
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,620
Are you sure it's okay to show it to you?

774
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,870
That's right! It's fine as long as you don't show me other people.

775
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,400
Have that guy come, too.

776
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,060
- He lives around here, right?
- Yes!

777
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,030
You better take responsibility if I get in trouble for this.

778
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,130
Come on, Hyung. We're attorneys.

779
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,070
- I have a criminal record.
- I'll defend you.

780
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,530
Deal.

781
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,530
Why'd you do that?

782
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,400
I can't even get a job,

783
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,450
and I stole someone's stuff after getting drunk.

784
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,130
Wow, I'm such a scumbag.

785
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,290
What do I do now, Attorney?

786
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,580
Act like you don't know anything.

787
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,220
That's how I should advise you as an attorney.

788
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,930
It won't be easy to prove you did it with only the police's CCTV footage.

789
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,720
But...

790
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:09,310
if I were your older sister,

791
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:13,630
I'd tell you to take that footage straight to the police station.

792
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,610
If you call yourself a scumbag for failing to get a job

793
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,290
and stealing someone else's stuff,

794
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,750
how will you live with yourself if you actually become a scumbag

795
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,960
by covering it up and lying?

796
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,640
It doesn't change your wrongdoing just because you're cleared of charges.

797
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,760
Estimation is about 68% of sales.

798
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,980
What the... Why are you all here like you planned it?

799
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,240
Oh?

800
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,580
Don't tell me you guys met without me.

801
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,120
We just happened to run into each other.

802
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,870
- You mean that, right?
- Is this kimbap?

803
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,980
I've been eating too much greasy food lately. I needed something spicy.

804
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,240
Eat up, man.

805
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,310
Spicy...

806
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,820
chili pepper kimbap.

807
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,230
Spicy chili pepper kimbap?

808
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,060
You got two rolls. Give me one.

809
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,920
Hands off! This is for Hui Ji.

810
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,690
I thought she might need it, too.

811
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,110
But Mun Jeong needs one, too.

812
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,880
What about Sang Ki?

813
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,850
Get one for yourself.

814
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,060
Since we're all here,

815
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,600
let's set a date to hang out since it's been a while.

816
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,350
How's next Friday?

817
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,000
- I'm available.
- Sounds good to me, too.

818
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,880
I'm free,

819
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,350
but Hui Ji probably won't be.

820
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,500
- Really?
- How do you know that?

821
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,760
I just do.

822
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,440
Because she needs to obtain the CCTV footage?

823
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,780
That's over now, but...

824
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,920
there's a reason for it.

825
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,960
Okay, then, how about tonight?

826
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,320
Tonight works for me, too.

827
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,900
- Me, too.
- That probably won't work, either.

828
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,040
- For you or for Hui Ji?
- For both of us.

829
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,800
Geez, when do we get together, then?

830
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,020
Hey, you said you've got a trial.

831
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,570
- Just go for now.
- Okay.

832
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,140
I'll just post a poll in the group chat.

833
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,100
This is Mun Jeong's case, but I'm doing a part-time job

834
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,690
for 10,000 won.

835
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:08,890
Hey, hey, hey! I said that's for Hui Ji!

836
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,190
What's wrong with that jerk?

837
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,950
Gosh, I can't do this. Seriously.

838
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,540
Bae Mun Jeong, take this back.

839
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,270
I can't do this for just 10,000 won, seriously.

840
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,400
Why not, Attorney?

841
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,390
How could you ask me to summarize 150 pages for just 10,000 won?

842
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,220
- No refunds.
- Give me 10,000 won more.

843
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,220
- Please buy me spicy chili pepper kimbap.
- Just 10,000 won more.

844
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,960
- Just 10,000 won more.
- Here.

845
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,530
- Yes, Managing Partner.
- You don't have court today, right?

846
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,830
- No.
- I heard my kid got hurt, so I rushed out.

847
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,440
I was so rushed that I forgot I had court today.

848
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,880
Could you fill in for me?

849
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,250
Sure, will do.

850
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,160
What time is the hearing?

851
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,020
At 4:00 p.m.

852
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,680
Oh, b-but it's 3:50 p.m. right now.

853
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,880
If you run fast, you could make it.

854
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,550
Let me hang up for now.

855
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,630
Sorry about that.

856
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,430
Shit.

857
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,560
- The files.
- Thank you.

858
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,960
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!

859
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,910
Excuse me!

860
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,820
Is the plaintiff, Pungcheon Trading, present?

861
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,360
Plaintiff? Pungcheon Trading?

862
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,520
- Yes, I'm here.
- Please come to the front.

863
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,010
Defendant Segi International?

864
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,030
Yes.

865
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:01,020
All right. The plaintiff submitted their brief yesterday.

866
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,890
We'll begin as soon as everyone is ready.

867
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,670
Hello, this is Ohn OB/GYN.

868
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,930
For appointments or inquiries...

869
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,380
Hello, this is Ohn OB/GYN.

870
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,430
Hello. Can I make an appointment?

871
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,030
The Chinese restaurant across the street?

872
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,270
Yes, there's a private CCTV there.

873
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,770
It captured everything with no blind spots.

874
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,430
Really?

875
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,530
Then, who was the culprit?

876
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,300
- It was me.
- Pardon?

877
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:15,330
Yes, it turned out my client had taken it.

878
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,050
I see.

879
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,290
Then, we'll discuss what to do about this.

880
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,480
We can take this as a surrender.

881
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,010
But I really don't know where the watch is.

882
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,250
I don't remember. I might've dropped it somewhere.

883
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,040
I'll compensate for it somehow.

884
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,150
Okay, I'll talk to the victim about that.

885
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,080
Don't worry too much.

886
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,910
I heard it wasn't that expensive.

887
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,790
Oh, I see. Thank you.

888
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,670
I guess you didn't tell your mom that you had a job interview today.

889
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,210
No.

890
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,670
What did you tell her?

891
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,660
I told her I was going to the police station.

892
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,780
Good.

893
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,060
Thank you, Attorney.

894
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,000
From now on, just call me "noona".

895
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,320
Since you listened to my advice as a sister, not as an attorney.

896
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,690
Okay.

897
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,550
Let's go.

898
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:26,620
I'm treating you to thank you. I'll grill the meat.

899
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,360
I'm grilling so I can eat faster.

900
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,580
When I heard everyone went to a barbecue without us last time,

901
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,080
I got so hurt.

902
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,590
Because you were so upset about it, I'm buying you a barbecue today.

903
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,300
I felt like you missed out because of me.

904
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,980
Still, everything turned out well.

905
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,140
That guy is more courageous than he looks.

906
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,780
Yeah. You're right.

907
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,550
This one's done. Eat it.

908
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,820
Thank you.

909
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,740
Oh, wait, wait.

910
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,400
Ma'am, one bottle of soju, please.

911
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,900
I really don't want to go to work.

912
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,860
Why?

913
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,720
This guy I hate...

914
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,000
I told him off as if I'd never see him again.

915
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,300
But I have to go see him again soon. That could even be tomorrow.

916
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,130
You must hate it.

917
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,180
You understood what I just said?

918
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:31,150
Not exactly...

919
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,410
but seems like you don't want to talk more about it.

920
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,450
Actually...

921
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,350
I've been doing visitation work recently.

922
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,570
- Visitation work?
- Yeah.

923
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,410
I'm not even legally representing him

924
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,930
but I have to go in every day to chat with him. It's exhausting.

925
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,850
How could they make you do that?

926
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:05,330
No wonder you've been looking serious at times lately.

927
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,510
- How long do you have to do this?
- I don't know.

928
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:15,290
Not knowing that is the worst part.

929
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,420
Cheers.

930
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,640
Should we order another spicy cold noodles?

931
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,100
Yes. Ma'am, one more spicy cold noodles, please.

932
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,800
Okay.

933
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,890
Excuse me. We'd like to order, please.

934
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,580
- Over here, please.
- Okay.

935
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,120
All right...

936
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,330
As you get older, you need something hot like this in your stomach.

937
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,300
You shouldn't eat cold food like this.

938
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,540
I've been coming here for years.

939
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,800
Please enjoy.

940
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,210
- Okay.
- Yes. Thank you for the food.

941
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,440
Anyway, it's great that our firm has grown in size and our sales are up,

942
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,540
thanks to you.

943
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,230
Thank you so much!

944
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,550
- Don't mention it.
- Yes.

945
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,430
The meat is cooked really well. It's cooked well.

946
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,170
- Here, try this.
- Oh, thank you.

947
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,890
Thank you.

948
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:45,340
So, why did you ask to see us today?

949
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,050
I'm a bit busy.

950
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,320
Oh, yes.

951
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,530
Since you're all busy,

952
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,840
I should get right to it.

953
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,560
I'd like to ask you to take a case.

954
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,410
It's not my personal case.

955
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:07,650
I'm just introducing the case to you, so don't feel too pressured.

956
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,970
- A legal representation?
- Yes.

957
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:17,370
Out of all of you, I'd like two people to handle it.

958
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:21,210
Since Ms. Kim Ryu Jin said she's busy...

959
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:26,310
and Mr. Seong Yu Deok said business is going well already,

960
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:32,540
I'd like Mr. Na Kyeong Min and Ms. Kang Jeong Yun to handle this case.

961
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,200
Us?

962
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,800
I wasn't saying our business was going that great.

963
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,820
- So, you're talking two cases?
- No, just one case.

964
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,020
One case? Then, why do you need both of us?

965
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,260
I'd like the two of you to co-counsel this case.

966
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,180
That's the only condition I have for this case.

967
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,410
I'm all for collaboration.

968
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:56,830
I see, Mr. Seong. That's all right.

969
01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:00,610
Now that we're all in one firm, let's use this opportunity to work together.

970
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,970
That way, I'll see the benefit of merging.

971
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,050
Together?

972
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,290
Think it over while you eat.

973
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,600
- How come you're not eating rice?
- I cut out carbs.

974
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,050
You were still here.

975
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,160
Yes.

976
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,000
Witness questioning?

977
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,500
Yes. You, too?

978
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,330
Yes.

979
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:53,080
Well, did the CCTV case get resolved?

980
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,690
After checking the footage, it turned out my client did take it.

981
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:00,070
He decided to confess honestly and ask for forgiveness.

982
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:04,200
It turned out it was just a mistake, and he wasn't a bad person.

983
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,980
Good job. I'm glad it worked out.

984
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,370
Yeah, I'm really glad.

985
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,490
Have dinner with me, too.

986
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,980
- Excuse me?
- I mean,

987
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,570
didn't you say you'd buy me dinner?

988
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:26,010
Oh, for Mr. Gu Dong Gyun's case?

989
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,680
Of course, I'll treat you.

990
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,550
Were you upset that I didn't?

991
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,300
I mean, I wasn't upset...

992
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,630
But a promise is a promise.

993
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,050
All right. I'll buy you dinner.

994
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,740
Think about what you'd like to eat.

995
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,440
Okay.

996
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,860
Yes, Mayor Park.

997
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:11,490
Attorney Ha Sang Ki?

998
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,420
What the...

999
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,030
"Law school, a modern-day aristocracy.

1000
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,780
List of elite..."

1001
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,900
- Via the Institute for Equal Opportunity,
- Oh my, what is this?

1002
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,950
SpoNews obtained part of the law school admissions list.

1003
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,430
Many children of former and current judges, prosecutors,

1004
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:38,910
politicians, entrepreneurs, and civil servants

1005
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:43,050
were found to have been admitted to law school.

1006
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,010
In pursuit of transparency, SpoNews has decided

1007
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:49,060
to release the list of admitted students.

1008
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,940
Whoa.

1009
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,940
Hanguk Group Chairman Ha Jong Man's eldest son, Ha X Gi,

1010
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,830
was expected to join the family conglomerate,

1011
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,340
but surprised many by starting his career

1012
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,330
at a small law firm in Seocho-dong.

1013
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,650
This contrasts with Oriental Dew Chairman Lee Ja Yeon's second daughter,

1014
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,080
and Borinics Chairman Oh Gi Cheol's eldest son,

1015
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,910
who entered a major law firm instead of entering their family business.

1016
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:12,710
It must be rough for the prince of Hanguk Group to toil as an associate attorney.

1017
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,550
Did he get that law firm position through nepotism?

1018
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,980
I was one of your previous clients.

1019
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,720
Why did you pretend to understand me?

1020
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,190
Now that I think about it, it's so repulsive.

1021
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,800
Rich kids pretending to care... it's hilarious, really.

1022
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,000
I guess you want a moving redemption arc.

1023
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,280
Enjoying your "ordinary people" experience?

1024
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,030
"Attorney's Table"?

1025
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,480
Bloody hilarious.

Did you know Attorney Ha was from a conglomerate family?

1032
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,890
So, no one is going to say anything about Sang Ki?

1033

Why are you getting all upset about?

Yeah, let's give Senior Sang Ki some time.

1035
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,640
You're oddly kind lately.

1036
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,040
I guess you've gone clubbing quite a bit.

1037

Yes. You haven't?

1038
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:16,420
I thought we were closer than just work colleagues.

1039

I guess only I thought we were friends.

1040
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:22,520
Can I say something about that?

1041
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,600
Did I say this 10 years ago, too?

1042
