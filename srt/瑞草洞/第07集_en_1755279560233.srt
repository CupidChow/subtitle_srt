2
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,600
- Hello?
- Hey.

3
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,480
I-Is this Ju Hyeong?

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,570
Yeah, it's been a while.

5
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,800
Y-Yeah, how've you been?

6
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,350
I've been doing okay.

7
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,660
- What's up?
- Well...

8
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,520
it's a bit awkward to say, but...

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,700
I was briefly seeing this female business client,

10
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,360
and it turned out she was married.

11
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,720
Yeah, and?

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,440
Well, so now her husband is...

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,050
spreading rumors at my company that I'm the guy she cheated with.

14
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,000
Is there any way to stop these rumors from spreading?

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,910
It's hard to stop that physically.

16
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,200
You can't follow everyone around and shut their mouths.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,940
Is there something I can do legally?

18
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,200
You probably can't stop it directly.

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,690
- Did he sue you for the affair?
- He hasn't filed one yet.

20
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,620
But if I didn't know she was married,

21
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,150
wouldn't I be okay even if he sued me?

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,750
You didn't know?

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,200
Seriously, I had no idea.

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,450
I even have texts saying she was single and lied.

25
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,430
Then you'll probably be fine.

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,190
If you want to sue for defamation, let me know.

27
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,410
I'll introduce you to another attorney.

28
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,700
It depends on where the leak is coming from,

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,230
whether it's from the upstairs pipes or a shared line.

30
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,950
The liability will be different depending on that.

31
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,700
Yeah, we'd have to open it up to know for sure.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,160
I don't know.

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm an attorney, not a plumber.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,560
Yeah, okay. Bye.

35
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,870
Gosh, seriously.

36
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah.

37
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,370
Is there a reason to sue the security guard?

38
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,500
About the law school internship program I mentioned before,

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,470
are you all okay with it?

40
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,270
We don't have the capacity for that.

41
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,200
And it'll cost a lot in small ways.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,030
- Who's covering the expenses?
- Don't worry about that.

43
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,880
I'll handle it so you won't have to worry.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,290
Okay, if that's the case.

45
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,660
I don't really have a reason to object,

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,310
but I'm not sure why we should do it, either.

47
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,410
I've never done it before and don't really know how it works,

48
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,830
so I'm not very interested.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,320
It's important to promote the firm to clients,

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,830
but we should also build connections with potential future attorneys

51
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,160
if we want to get good attorneys in the future.

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,550
You speak as if you really are a part of our firm.

53
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm grateful to you for helping our firm grow in size,

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,970
but that doesn't mean you're actually part of our firm.

55
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,110
I think that last comment crossed the line a bit.

56
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,240
And there's no mention of the cases you promised to refer.

57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,920
Well, I think it'd be great if law students

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,240
learned about our firm.

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,650
Don't you think, partners?

60
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,540
- I won't object, either.
- Same here.

61
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,760
Yeah, sounds great. It's great.

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Who doesn't know that it will be great?

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm not objecting, either.

64
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,550
As long as you take care of everything.

65
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,560
Thank you so much.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,630
I'll do my best to make it go smoothly.

67
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,800
Can I order dessert?

68
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,040
Of course.

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,050
Do you eat meringue?

70
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,200
- Meringue...
- Pardon?

71
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,230
Oh, yes, thank you.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,140
E-Excuse me, the grand opening...

73
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,320
Yes, here.

74
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,460
Oh, okay.

75
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,730
Here, thank you...

76
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,060
Yes, it's the grand opening...

77
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,920
Here you go. Yes.

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,150
Hello.

79
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,200
- Hello!
- Hello!

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,930
Please, take a seat. Take a seat.

81
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,810
Welcome to Law Group Hyungmin.

82
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,180
Thank you, Attorney.

83
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,970
Oh, I'm not an attorney.

84
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm an advisor, yes, an advisor.

85
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,930
Oh, you're not an attorney?

86
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,670
Then, when will the other attorneys get here?

87
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,990
Follow me. I'll introduce them to you.

88
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,120
- Oh, okay, okay!
- Sounds good!

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,540
Are you busy, Attorney?

90
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,990
Oh, hello, Advisor.

91
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,550
The internship starts today,

92
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,130
so I was wondering if I can introduce them to you?

93
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,140
Oh, yes, yes.

94
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,350
Hello.

95
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,350
- Hello!
- Hello!

96
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,520
This is Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

97
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,170
I look forward to working with you.

98
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,030
- I look forward to working with you!
- I look forward to working with you!

99
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,360
- I look forward to working with you as well.
- Yes...

100
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,980
- Goodbye.
- Okay, goodbye.

101
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,610
And if it's okay, could I borrow a few closed-case files?

102
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,950
I'd like for the students to take a look.

103
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,840
Oh, thank you, Attorney.

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,420
If you have time, please stop by and check on them.

105
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,450
You can give them a simple assignment, too.

106
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,800
Yes, will do.

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes?

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,330
Attorney, the court-appointed defendant has arrived.

109
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,240
Oh, right. They're in the conference room, right?

110
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm sorry, I could only hire you

111
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,880
as a public defender because of my financial situation.

112
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,270
No, no. Don't worry about that.

113
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,440
You've been indicted for aiding and abetting fraud.

114
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,050
You know what this charge is about, right?

115
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,020
Indicted? What does that mean, Attorney?

116
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,910
I read it, but I don't understand any of it.

117
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,850
The prosecution has formally accused you of committing a crime

118
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,980
and has brought your case to trial.

119
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,590
That's what "indicted" means.

120
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,650
The charge is aiding and abetting fraud.

121
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,560
I know what fraud is, but what's "abetting"?

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,100
Does that mean I just stood by while the fraud happened?

123
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,270
That's a common misunderstanding.

124
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,290
But it doesn't mean you stood by. It means you helped.

125
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,200
It's basically acting as an accomplice.

126
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,420
You're saying I helped with fraud?

127
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,240
Yes. It says here you were involved in voice phishing,

128
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,220
that you acted as a "cash mule."

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,800
That means you withdrew the scammed money and handed it over.

130
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,510
No, all I did was try to get a loan.

131
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,050
It says you received a text about a loan from someone named Deputy Baek Jeong Hyeon

132
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,730
from BX Bank and talked to him on the phone.

133
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,480
Do you remember the conversation?

134
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,810
Yes. At first, he said it would be hard to get a loan,

135
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,500
but he said he'd make a special exception to get me a loan.

136
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,900
Your credit score is low because your account doesn't have much activity.

137
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,990
We'll help you build a transaction history first.

138
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,580
In my bank account?

139
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,050
I'm offering this because I trust you, Ms. Do.

140
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,850
Here you go.

141
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,520
I'll deposit money into your account to create some transaction records.

142
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,110
Thank you.

143
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,530
But you must not keep that money.

144
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,360
You have to return it to me. Okay?

145
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,900
- Good job.
- Thank you.

146
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,510
Thank you.

147
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,800
But they didn't give me the loan in the end.

148
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,040
Do you happen to have a recording of that call?

149
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,890
I'm not sure.

150
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,100
- Could I check your phone again really quick?
- Oh, yes, yes.

151
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,120
This was last November, so...

152
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh, here it is.

153
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,040
Hello, this is BX Bank Deputy Baek Jeong Hyeon.

154
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,730
How can I help you?

155
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,780
I'm calling after receiving your text.

156
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,240
It was recorded.

157
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,780
You were alone at the police investigation, right?

158
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,930
Yes.

159
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,320
You were probably indicted because your explanation wasn't properly communicated.

160
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,290
If this recording had been submitted, it would've been clear

161
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,340
you were deceived and not an accomplice.

162
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,310
Then, will I be okay?

163
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,920
I wasn't involved in this voice phishing thing, right?

164
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,330
Well, it's true that the voice phishing victims

165
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,450
transferred money into your account.

166
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,610
And you did withdraw that money

167
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,030
and deliver it to the fraudsters.

168
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,030
But you didn't know that's what it was.

169
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,890
I didn't know.

170
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,383
Actually, I wondered if this was a scam like voice phishing,

171
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,908
so I asked them, but they said it wasn't.

172
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,663
It's not like he was demanding money from me.

173
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:59,890
He was just offering a loan, so I believed him.

174
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,880
Don't worry too much.

175
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,940
Once I download and submit this recording,

176
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,420
you'll likely be found not guilty.

177
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,840
Goodness! Thank you, Attorney.

178
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,880
Voice phishing ringleaders are usually overseas.

179
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,860
So the authorities go after the cash mules first

180
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,570
and give them heavy sentences.

181
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,710
I hear they serve years in prison.

182
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,570
Even so, she didn't even know she was used as a cash mule.

183
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,390
How could they investigate carelessly and charge someone like her?

184
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,440
Is that guy still not answering?

185
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,940
No. I'm so annoyed.

186
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,270
If I ever catch that jerk, I swear...

187
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,990
That jerk—  that guy who didn't get paid for the construction?

188
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,870
Yeah.

189
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,670
The on-site evaluation is tomorrow. What's he doing?

190
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,870
He wouldn't provide the documents, and I can't reach him.

191
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,310
He can't just dump the lawsuit.

192
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,630
Calm down, calm down.

193
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,540
The project wasn't even finished.

194
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,340
The construction was halted due to a payment dispute.

195
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,550
We need someone who actually knows what happened on-site.

196
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,110
The client is chill while I'm the one freaking out.

197
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,690
Anyone would think I'm the one who didn't get paid.

198
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,160
That's what I thought, honestly.

199
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,540
Still, it's nice being at a café for once.

200
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,040
We've only been hanging out at the lounge these days.

201
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,710
Are the interns staying in the lounge?

202
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,820
Yeah. Did they stop by your office, too?

203
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,850
They asked us to review their work periodically.

204
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,570
- Yeah, they came by.
- Was I that baby-faced when I was in law school?

205
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,000
I guess they were kind of cute.

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,030
They didn't come to me, though.

207
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,450
Hey.

208
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,230
I guess the Advisor figured out that you're a brat.

209
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,860
What are you going to do now?

210
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,530
I was out this morning. They must've come by then.

211
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,680
But shouldn't we at least throw a welcome dinner?

212
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,520
I can't today.

213
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,510
That contractor probably won't show up tomorrow.

214
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,870
I should at least comb through all the materials tonight.

215
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,400
How about tomorrow?

216
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,820
I've got plans.

217
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,150
- With whom?
- He has a high school reunion.

218
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,050
My husband insisted on going there, even though

219
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,060
his wife is in early pregnancy.

220
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,750
He used you as an excuse to go

221
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,790
saying it was rare for you to show up.

222
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,310
He said to make sure I come, so he could use me as his excuse.

223
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,710
He'd buy to celebrate the pregnancy.

224
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,820
Give me a break.

225
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,680
Is he the one who's pregnant?

226
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,900
Then, I'll make plans for tomorrow, too.

227
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,120
Let's do the welcome dinner tomorrow.

228
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,300
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, let's do it tomorrow.

229
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,000
Ju Hyeong doesn't have to be there since the Advisor didn't ask him.

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,320
Right?

231
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,810
I told you, I was out when they came.

232
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,770
- Hello!
- Hello!

233
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,460
No need to be so formal with us.

234
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,880
Please sit down. It's not like I'm your professor or boss.

235
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,140
Please sit. Please sit.

236
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,440
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're sitting.

237
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,360
Just kidding. Kidding. Please sit.

238
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,180
Oh, okay.

239
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,470
Did you read this as well?

240
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,820
No, I haven't yet.

241
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,620
I handled this case.

242
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,030
- Oh, my.
- Amazing.

243
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,630
If you're up for it, how about writing a case report?

244
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,420
- Sounds good. I'll try writing one.
- Me, too!

245
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,190
If anything's unclear, I can review it briefly.

246
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,500
This can seem like a word play.

247
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,880
But the sentence structure is...

248
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,200
- Deputy?
- Yes?

249
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,160
Could you copy the evidence records from today's court-appointed case?

250
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,390
Sure.

251
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,870
Wait, Ms. Kim.

252
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,780
- This is a court-appointed case, right?
- Yes.

253
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,800
Make the copies yourself for court-appointed cases. Don't ask other staff.

254
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,400
But we've always done it this way.

255
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,870
And you've approved it, too.

256
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,600
Yeah, stop doing that now.

257
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,390
Technically speaking, court-appointed cases aren't firm cases.

258
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,810
They're your personal cases, Attorney Jo.

259
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,020
But the firm still gets public service hours out of it.

260
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm fulfilling that through these cases.

261
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,210
Does the case fee come to the firm?

262
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,500
They go to you.

263
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,590
Ms. Kim, don't worry about the court-appointed cases from now on.

264
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,790
- Okay.
- All right.

265
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,180
Water the plants instead.

266
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,010
I'll take care of it.

267
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,760
Thank you.

268
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,364
- Your credit score is too low.
- I guess getting a loan will be hard.

269
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,660
We can help you.

270
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,280
I'm offering this because I trust you, Ms. Do.

271
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,300
Wait, they indicted her even with all this?

272
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,910
Gosh.

273
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,210
Why do they always come in when I'm taking a short break

274
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,640
and scare the crap out of me?

275
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,890
Why did you get so startled?

276
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,160
Were you watching something weird?

277
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,680
No.

278
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,270
But what's up?

279
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,840
Just because.

280
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,820
- Are you super busy?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,980
Because of the evaluation tomorrow.

282
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,750
The construction details changed multiple times, so I need to be well-prepared,

283
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,650
but since the client's not cooperating,

284
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,430
I'm stuck like this.

285
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,330
But is it okay for you to be working this late?

286
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,690
Why not? I often work through the night.

287
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,530
But shouldn't you stop doing that now?

288
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,480
Because of the baby?

289
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,690
Is that right?

290
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,860
Your belly looks like it's bulging a little, too.

291
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,380
It's not.

292
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,510
It's only been a few weeks. Why would it bulge already?

293
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,810
- It's not?
- It's not!

294
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,350
Okay.

295
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,400
What are you doing here this late?

296
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,930
I'm working on that voice phishing case I mentioned earlier.

297
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,860
That case seemed simple.

298
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,280
Why are you still stuck on it?

299
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,870
It's not that simple after all.

300
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,240
It should've been an easy case to defend,

301
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,230
but they went ahead and indicted her even though there was

302
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,720
clear evidence of innocence.

303
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,310
Yeah, since voice phishing is still a huge problem,

304
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,190
they're cracking down pretty hard.

305
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,490
Exactly. That's why I'm worried.

306
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,210
Even though it seems like a reckless indictment,

307
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,390
I'm afraid she'll still be found guilty.

308
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,150
Gosh, seriously.

309
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,540
They can't catch actual criminals like Jang Su Gil.

310
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,600
You're done being a visitation attorney, right?

311
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,450
Yeah. Hey, it was the first time

312
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,160
I wanted the prosecution to catch my client.

313
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,550
No, technically, I wasn't his attorney,

314
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,100
so he wasn't even my client.

315
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,590
Gosh, don't overthink it. Just forget about it.

316
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,360
It bothers me that they're charging innocent people

317
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,760
instead of catching jerks like him.

318
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,630
- The customer is not answering the phone.
- Geez.

319
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,750
After the beep...

320
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,410
He's still not picking up.

321
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:57,610
On behalf of the defendant's construction team, right?

322
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,940
Yes.

323
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,910
Are you the only one on the plaintiff's side, Attorney?

324
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,950
Yes.

325
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,580
Really?

326
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,630
Then, let's get started.

327
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,000
Please wear this.

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,440
Okay.

329
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,210
What material was the flooring supposed to be?

330
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,760
Well, mortar.

331
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,500
- Self-leveling type?
- Yes.

332
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,070
What was the ceiling finish supposed to be?

333
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,260
Sheet Molding Compound.

334
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,530
And all the piping was going to go through here?

335
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,670
Well, yes.

336
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,580
How far apart are the stirrups spaced?

337
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,950
I'm not sure.

338
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,410
It should be noted in the blueprints.

339
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,170
W-W-Wait...

340
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,770
Here, you can look at this.

341
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,190
- Is this the blueprint?
- Yes.

342
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,510
I don't think I saw the staircase rebar placement drawing.

343
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,140
Me neither.

344
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,420
They never showed it to us.

345
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,700
Here's the rebar placement drawing.

346
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,390
We have records showing we sent it to the defendant.

347
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,510
You never sent it to us.

348
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,370
I sent it.

349
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,270
Look. There's even the email record.

350
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,880
Great work, everyone.

351
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,540
I'll submit the evaluation report quickly.

352
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,530
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

353
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,390
And what was the original plan for paving the access road?

354
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,100
- Oh, that…
- Asphalt concrete.

355
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,350
What was the aggregate size for the surface layer?

356
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,440
13mm.

357
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,250
That was the original plan.

358
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,760
13mm.

359
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,160
Okay.

360
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,710
Attention passengers.

361
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,320
This train has designated priority seats

362
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,240
for transportation-vulnerable passengers,

363
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,680
including those with disabilities, pregnant women,

364
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,060
and passengers with young children.

365
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,460
Please be especially considerate of early-stage pregnant women

366
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,110
whose pregnancy may not be visibly apparent.

367
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,300
Thank you.

368
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,020
Where do you get one of these?

369
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,120
Pardon?

370
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,360
I recently became pregnant, but I don't know much about this stuff.

371
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,230
Oh, really? Congratulations.

372
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,380
How far along are you?

373
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
32 weeks now.

374
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,950
You don't have much longer to go.

375
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,290
It must be really tough, right?

376
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,860
No, I'm still doing okay for now.

377
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,780
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

378
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,270
But seriously, where do you get one of these?

379
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,620
Gosh, seriously.

380
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,270
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

381
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,070
Did someone ask you to rush this?

382
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,230
Attorney Ha Sang Ki asked us to try writing a case report.

383
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,770
What are you all doing? Let's go.

384
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,610
Senior, did you tell them to finish this by today?

385
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,840
Yeah.

386
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,550
What's this? You still haven't finished yet? I gave you plenty of time.

387
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,900
At this rate, we won't make it to the welcome dinner.

388
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,730
You can complete this by tomorrow.

389
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,150
Attorney Ha, they can finish this by tomorrow. Right?

390
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,410
By tomorrow... morning.

391
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,720
- Gosh.
- Come on!

392
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,400
Just get it done by tomorrow. End of day. Take your time.

393
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,210
- Let's go. Move, move, move!
- Hey.

394
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,540
Hey, what about Ju Hyeong?

395
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,460
- He had a school reunion, remember?
- Oh, right.

396
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,530
Oh, you got one.

397
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,240
It's pretty, it's pretty.

398
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,660
It's cute.

399
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,000
Hey, long time no see!

400
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,280
Hey, Ju Hyeong!

401
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,890
What the...

402
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,540
J-Ju Hyeong's here, too...

403
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,880
Didn't I tell you? I told him he had to come.

404
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,310
It's been a while, guys.

405
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,540
Yeah, it's been a while.

406
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,270
Goodness, everyone's here on time.

407
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,540
Oh, Ji Hun.

408
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,060
Hey, An Ju Hyeong, how long has it been?

409
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,300
Was it early July of 2021?

410
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,120
Isn't this the first time since you showed up briefly in the Sinsa area and

411
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,630
left before the second round?

412
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,050
- Is it?
- How do you remember everything like that?

413
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,130
Of course I do.

414
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,190
I even remember the song you sang at karaoke that night.

415
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,710
- You're drinking makgeolli, right?
- Yeah.

416
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,520
- No.
- Just have makgeolli.

417
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,340
Excuse me, one makgeolli here, please.

418
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,100
Okay.

419
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,580
But if I didn't know she was married,

420
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,700
wouldn't I be okay even if he sued me?

421
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,720
Ju Hyeong, what do I need to prepare

422
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,180
to get the upper hand in a divorce?

423
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,380
Is there any way I can get my money back?

424
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,370
I'm going to the restroom.

425
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

426
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,850
Your tie is so tacky.

427
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,000
- I need to go, too.
- Okay.

428
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,700
Hey, people call this...

429
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,500
Ju Hyeong.

430
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,230
I decided to try and

431
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,960
work things out with my wife.

432
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,860
I'm just saying thanks.

433
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,400
- For what?
- I asked you about it last time.

434
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,990
Things weren't good with my wife.

435
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,670
Oh, did you?

436
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,040
Sorry, I've been out of it lately.

437
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,100
If you don't remember, even better.

438
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,220
But man, you're so indifferent.

439
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,700
Can't I choose a pretty one?

440
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,260
How old are you that you're picking pink?

441
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,830
So childish. Seriously.

442
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,500
I won't even respond to that.

443
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,430
How do you all still look so good?

444
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,900
You must all be doing well.

445
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,600
What's there to worry about?

446
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,330
Yeah.

447
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,840
You know our lives are pretty calm.

448
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,300
Smooth sailing.

449
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,980
Right, except for him.

450
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,300
Him?

451
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,490
Huh?

452
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,770
Hey, so did that get resolved?

453
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,220
W-What do you mean?

454
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,000
The affair with the married woman!

455
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,740
What was that head shake just now?

456
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,350
This is unbelievable.

457
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,310
Hey, having an affair with a married woman calls for people to shake their heads.

458
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,210
- You took it too far, man.
- Yeah.

459
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,200
I told you I didn't know she was married.

460
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,450
You're an attorney, yet you go around blabbing about people's dirty laundry?

461
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,530
I was wondering why you came tonight.

462
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,360
You came to see this, huh?

463
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,530
Wait, what?

464
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,980
You told Ju Hyeong about this?

465
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,830
I have no idea what you're talking about.

466
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,670
Then, where did you hear that?

467
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,220
The word has spread all over our office.

468
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,240
You're the hottest gossip in every workplace these days.

469
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,720
That was him?

470
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,830
It was him?

471
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,860
Hey, please go around telling people it's not me!

472
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,980
I'm losing my mind over this!

473
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,990
But shouldn't you apologize to Ju Hyeong?

474
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,660
Fine, sorry about that.

475
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,510
- Do it properly.
- Do it properly if you're going to.

476
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,750
Don't just go through the motions.

477
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,520
Gosh, I'll handle it! Leave me alone.

478
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,380
- It's fine.
- No...

479
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,660
it's not fine—

480
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,570
Okay, okay, let's toast. Cheers.

481
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,280
Anyway, great work today.

482
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,840
Even though you drank, go and review some cases.

483
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,080
- Enough, enough.
- Hey, hey!

484
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,650
- Thanks for the food!
- Thanks for the food!

485
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,480
- Thanks for the food!
- Thanks for the food!

486
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,780
Anytime, anytime.

487
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,160
We'll get going first, then.

488
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,920
- Get home safely.
- Great work today.

489
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,700
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

490
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,520
Let's go.

491
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,220
What?

492
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,990
Sad it's over? Should we go for round two?

493
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,270
Round two?

494
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,750
I'm down. Where to?

495
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,120
- Want to go where Ju Hyeong is?
- Sounds good!

496
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,110
Remember when that freshman fell for that older department rep girl

497
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,720
and was asking what he should do?

498
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
Mun Jeong!

499
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,180
- What are you doing here?
- Did you drink a lot?

500
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,600
No, no.

501
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,390
Oh, hello.

502
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,840
Congratulations, ma'am!

503
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,450
- Let me introduce you.
- No, it's fine.

504
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,770
Please, have a seat.

505
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,960
- Oh, hi.
- Come, come, come.

506
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,470
- What, why, why?
- No, it's fine.

507
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,990
Can't we drink together? I thought we were sitting with them.

508
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,510
- No, no, no, no. Sit here.
- See you later!

509
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,840
Sit here instead.

510
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,820
Be good to your wife, man.

511
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,920
I am.

512
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,520
Hey, that girl.

513
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,660
Isn't she the girl you met on your trip during law school?

514
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,250
Or is it someone who looks like her?

515
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,710
No, it is her. She is that girl—

516
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,540
What the, what happened?

517
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,580
Who? Attorney Kang?

518
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,610
We just happened to end up working in the same building.

519
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,850
You were freaking out, saying you met someone you liked

520
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,410
and sent us her photos, asking what you should do.

521
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,790
What? You two were like that?

522
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,640
No, we just work together.

523
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,590
- You know her, too?
- Yeah, last time, he called me

524
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,840
late at night, asking me to help her.

525
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,540
That's amazing.

526
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,400
What? Are you trying to get back with her again?

527
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,360
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

528
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,520
Really? Are you sure?

529
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,820
Yeah.

530
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,120
- Are you sure?
- No idea.

531
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,650
Then, introduce me.

532
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,940
- What?
- No.

533
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,940
Why not?

534
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,610
She doesn't like blind dates. She despises them.

535
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,490
She's into those natural encounters, I see.

536
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,540
Let's not just do this yearly. Let's meet up more often.

537
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,640
Yeah, let's see each other more.

538
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,160
And stop sulking all the time.

539
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,450
Are you coming to the next hangout?

540
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,680
Who knows? Depends.

541
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,650
Why? Should I not come?

542
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,510
Come on, no.

543
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,010
That's not what I meant.

544
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,940
Hey, Mun Jeong!

545
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,150
These are my old classmates.

546
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,820
And these are my friends.

547
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,980
Nice to meet you.

548
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,690
I really appreciated your help last time,

549
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,880
but I couldn't make the dinner. I'm sorry.

550
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,530
Oh, no, don't worry.

551
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,750
Ju Hyeong paid for the dinner that day.

552
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,450
Oh, now I see why you paid.

553
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,450
For Ju Hyeong to feel empathetic toward Attorney Kang...

554
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,680
I hear I'm slow when it comes to reading the room.

555
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,880
It turns out that ever since Hong Kong, this guy and Attorney Kang—

556
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,550
Hey, Mun Jeong is looking for you.

557
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,060
Hello. I'm Min Ji Hoon, Ju Hyeong's friend.

558
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,690
I see. Hello.

559
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,270
I heard you don't like blind dates—

560
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,080
Hey, if you're drunk, just go home.

561
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll properly introduce myself next time, for sure.

562
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,590
- Go, go.
- Let's go.

563
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,960
- Okay, we're leaving.
- Goodbye.

564
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,060
- All right, see you.
- We're off, too.

565
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,850
- Get home safely!
- See you!

566
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,980
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

567
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,110
- So, are you taking the bus?
- Yeah.

568
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,670
I think I'll take the bus tonight, too.

569
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,270
All right, okay. For us,

570
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,940
- the subway.
- See you.

571
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,330
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Bye!

572
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,990
Shall we go, too?

573
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,560
What was that blind date talk about earlier?

574
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,760
Blind date?

575
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,980
When Ji Hun saw Attorney Kang earlier at the bar,

576
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,630
he asked to be set up.

577
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,810
I heard something about her hating blind dates.

578
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,100
Ju Hyeong said so.

579
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,810
That he can't, since Attorney Kang hates blind dates.

580
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,150
Look at this guy...

581
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,370
It's not true?

582
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,150
- No, it's true.
- Right?

583
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,250
She seems that way.

584
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,560
What's that in your hand?

585
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,800
French fries.

586
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,150
What?

587
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,670
I saw you enjoying them earlier.

588
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,540
You couldn't even eat lately with your morning sickness.

589
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,510
So, this whole bag is fries?

590
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,600
Yeah.

591
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,920
Are you crazy?

592
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,760
That's enough to last a week!

593
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,930
Yeah. Okay, got it.

594
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,000
Let me know if you need anything else.

595
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,570
And tell me how it turns out.

596
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,690
Okay.

597
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,450
Was that a friend?

598
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,600
Yes. Lately, a lot of my friends have things going on.

599
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,210
They keep calling to ask legal stuff.

600
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,570
Are you very close to them?

601
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,820
I'm pretty close to them.

602
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,310
Then, don't follow up on how it turns out.

603
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,810
Pardon?

604
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,510
If you can erase it all from your memory, even better.

605
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,870
Why?

606
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,380
Because it can create distance.

607
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,540
But we're friends. Shouldn't I check in on how they're doing?

608
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,420
Won't it be even more alienating if I act indifferently?

609
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,300
If it's something bad, being indifferent helps the relationship.

610
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,580
They're asking you now because it's urgent.

611
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,130
But in the end, no one wants to be around someone

612
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,720
who knows about their bad moments.

613
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,110
Is that so?

614
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,370
Did you not enjoy the reunion earlier?

615
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,610
- Do I look like I didn't?
- A little?

616
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,160
That's odd. I'm pretty happy right now.

617
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,030
Why do I look like I didn't?

618
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,840
You look happy now.

619
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,480
But why did you tell them I hate blind dates?

620
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,280
If your friends even remember,

621
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,540
you must've really enjoyed your time with me in Hong Kong.

622
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,560
I'm not sure what you mean.

623
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,010
I heard everything earlier.

624
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,410
- Well, about that...
- So,

625
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,300
what are some moments you enjoyed so much?

626
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,650
Hey, do you...

627
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,690
want to grab something to eat?

628
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,070
Sure.

629
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,980
Thank you.

630
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,380
Take a look at the menu.

631
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,150
Do you have any recommendations here?

632
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,550
You speak English?

633
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,770
I can't understand you.

634
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,230
You don't speak Cantonese?

635
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,060
Noodles or rice?

636
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,950
This fried egg is good. This is a pork chop.

637
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,950
Rice bowls are good, too. Okay.

638
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,570
Is beef noodle soup okay?

639
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,460
Yes, sounds good.

640
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,510
This is steak.

641
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,910
Oh, you meant the "Sweet Sweet" dish! Okay.

642
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,020
Please wait a moment.

643
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,720
Your pronunciation is really good.

644
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,480
I've been all over the place for lessons since I was young.

645
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,960
I majored in piano.

646
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,000
I actually came here for a performance gig to fill in for a friend.

647
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,490
I guess you know a lot of Chinese characters, too.

648
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,990
Oh, law books have a lot of them. Right?

649
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,150
Oh, no.

650
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,640
It's because I studied them for years with worksheets as a kid.

651
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,530
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

652
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,950
- Yes.
- How did you find this place?

653
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,420
"Comrades: Almost a Love Story."

654
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,700
Someone said it looked like a place from that movie.

655
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,760
Oh, you don't like Hong Kong films?

656
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't really know much about them.

657
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,820
Wait a second.

658
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,450
These are all the places from the movie.

659
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,270
You're going to visit all of these places?

660
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,540
Wow. Where are we right now?

661
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:37,510
We're at the gang's base.

662
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,690
Here's your Sweet Sweet dishes!

663
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,640
This one's for the lady, and this one's for the gentleman.

664
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,750
Looks delicious!

665
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,580
♫  In a sea of unfamiliar lights  ♫

666
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,120
Stop, stop!

667
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,900
Stop!

668
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,300
♫  You stood out, shining so brightly  ♫

669
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:33,350
♫  What began as coincidence  ♫

670
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:39,930
♫  I hope we are meant to be wrapped in fate  ♫

671
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:49,970
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

672
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:56,460
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

673
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:06,150
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

674
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:14,700
♫  That it was nice to meet you, and I liked you  ♫

675
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,670
Shall we go?

676
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:29,000
♫  You still approach me with gentle warmth  ♫

677
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:40,100
♫  You and I from back then, if we ever meet again  ♫

678
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:46,470
♫  I want to say to you  ♫

679
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:54,490
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

680
00:40:54,490 --> 00:41:00,480
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

681
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,770
So...

682
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,520
do you think we'll see each other when we're back in Seoul?

683
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,300
We agreed to see each other again when we got to Seoul.

684
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,790
We haven't really decided for sure yet, have we?

685
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,540
We could just be on a high of being on a trip.

686
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:34,800
♫  Though you may not want to hear this  ♫

687
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,920
♫  These are the words I've kept in my heart  ♫

688
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:51,220
♫  I've liked you since then  ♫

689
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,560
So, I'm asking you which moment you enjoyed.

690
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,950
Everything I just mentioned.

691
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,650
I told you because you asked what moment I enjoyed.

692
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,000
- Everything?
- Yes.

693
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,380
Come on.

694
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,320
How come you don't even remember this?

695
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,262
I've had this on forever. You couldn't see this?

696
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:10,681
- You seriously didn't see this?
- Stop shaking your hand.

697
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:13,711
How could I not know this? I bought it for you.

698
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,990
- Let's go.
- Yes.

699
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,780
The defendant is accused of aiding and abetting

700
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,840
voice phishing fraud committed by unidentified individuals.

701
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,260
Defense Counsel,

702
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,480
please state your opinion on the charges and evidence.

703
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,430
We deny the charges and agree to the evidence submitted

704
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,510
but deny its implication of guilt.

705
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,690
Understood.

706
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,440
We'll proceed with the evidence review.

707
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,320
Okay, the evidence review is complete.

708
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,480
Prosecution, your sentencing recommendation?

709
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,050
Yes, Counsel?

710
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,870
We'd like to conduct an examination of the defendant.

711
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,140
An examination of the defendant?

712
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,070
I forgot to ask that.

713
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,950
But do you really need to?

714
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,780
Why don't you just cover it in your closing?

715
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,830
Still, I'd appreciate the opportunity to let the defendant explain

716
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,010
what happened in her own words.

717
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,400
When you first received the loan text,

718
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,870
you thought it was from a real bank. Right?

719
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,930
Yes.

720
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,950
When the person pretending to be a bank employee said

721
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,620
they'd create a transaction history to get you the loan,

722
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,770
you believed it?

723
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,890
Yes, I didn't know it was a scam,

724
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,520
even while I was being investigated by the police.

725
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,040
You didn't gain anything from this in the end, correct?

726
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,060
No, in the end, I didn't even get the loan.

727
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,290
I got nothing for this.

728
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,560
You were also deceived by the one impersonating Deputy Baek Jeong Hyeon, correct?

729
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,710
Yes, I think so.

730
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,650
That is all.

731
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,760
Prosecutor, would you like a cross-examination?

732
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,020
Yes, I'll just ask one question.

733
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,180
Defendant,

734
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,670
you asked the unidentified individual if this was voice phishing, correct?

735
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,210
Yes, I did.

736
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,080
That is all.

737
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,680
I'd like a re-direct examination.

738
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,650
Please keep it short.

739
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,720
When you asked that question,

740
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,880
he said it wasn't voice phishing

741
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,720
and said to forget it if you don't want a loan. Right?

742
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,870
Yes, he clearly denied it.

743
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,630
The reason you asked if it was voice phishing

744
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,220
was because you suspected they might ask you for money.

745
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,530
Yes, that's right.

746
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,490
I briefly worried that they might try to extort money from me.

747
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,550
But they didn't ask me for money, so I assumed it was legit.

748
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,020
Rather, they said they'd give me their money

749
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,980
to build my transaction history, so I was grateful.

750
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,340
- That is all.
- Defendant, please return to your seat.

751
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,980
Prosecutor, give us your sentencing recommendation.

752
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,520
Okay.

753
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:52,620
We request a fine of 15 million won for the defendant.

754
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,730
Defense Counsel, give us your closing statement.

755
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,740
The defendant, Do Mi Gyeong, was in serious financial hardship.

756
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,250
So the loan ad that promised approval despite

757
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,330
low credit must have been appealing.

758
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,920
More than just appealing, it probably felt like her only hope.

759
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,040
I agree with the prosecution's intent to prevent voice phishing

760
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,190
by catching and punishing the cash mules

761
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,250
since the ringleaders are hard to catch.

762
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,400
However, nitpicking her question, "Is this voice phishing?"

763
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,180
and using it as a pretext to apply the legal theory of dolus eventualis

764
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,300
to forcefully label the defendant as an accomplice

765
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,830
when she didn't even know she was a cash mule

766
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,510
is not appropriate.

767
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,940
The defendant was also deceived into making the withdrawals.

768
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,280
There are transcripts of the call in the evidence records.

769
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,810
Don't you know this as well, Prosecutor?

770
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:48,700
Isn't that why you asked for a relatively low penalty?

771
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,040
You might think, "How could anyone not know?"

772
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,500
But not everyone understands the structure of voice phishing.

773
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,730
It's possible not to know and be deceived as a result.

774
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,830
But you can't call that a crime.

775
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,280
Thus, please recognize that the defendant

776
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,980
had no intent to assist in fraud,

777
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,580
and find her not guilty.

778
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,680
That is all.

779
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,160
Second, careful review.

780
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,290
1. A serious reason for termination of contrakt...

781
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,650
Stuff like this. This, I spotted one.

782
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:47,390
It's "contract," not "contrakt."

783
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,340
See what I mean, okay?

784
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,480
I'm sorry.

785
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,910
Please double-check before submitting.

786
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,990
I'll be watching closely next time.

787
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,620
All right, next.

788
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,550
I'm sorry. Forgive me for being late.

789
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,840
Are you joining us today, Advisor?

790
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,420
I wanted to sit in, too. Am I not allowed?

791
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,450
No, no. We were just getting started.

792
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,230
Oh, okay.

793
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,640
All right. In a contract for buying and selling a pension property,

794
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,950
you wrote that whether the BBQ area remains

795
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,310
is an essential part of the agreement. Right?

796
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,990
Yes. In Korea, a BBQ area is essential

797
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,090
when renting a pension.

798
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,960
So, if the BBQ area is gone,

799
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,990
I thought terminating the contract was valid.

800
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,950
Correct. Applause.

801
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,700
Thank you.

802
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,850
- Or is it?
- Pardon?

803
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:39,990
What do others think?

804
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,010
I thought the contract should still stand.

805
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,240
A pension's primary business is lodging.

806
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,000
So, I viewed everything else as secondary.

807
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,920
I think the ratio of the BBQ area

808
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,580
to the total lot size matters,

809
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,070
but that data wasn't provided.

810
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,550
Area ratio?

811
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,840
That's quite an interesting perspective.

812
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,530
Or it may be completely irrelevant.

813
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,120
What about you, Intern?

814
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,690
I think the key is whether the value

815
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,730
of the BBQ area was factored

816
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:14,630
into the price at signing.

817
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,790
That's good, but no one mentioned the mistake of motive.

818
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,660
I'm sure you all learned it.

819
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,620
Motive?

820
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,210
- Yes, Advisor?
- I learned it.

821
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,410
Wow, you're in big trouble in this case, Interns.

822
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,410
If the Advisor knows this, and she didn't study law,

823
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:33,270
we've got a problem here. Don't we?

824
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:37,650
By tomorrow, prepare 10 precedent cases on the mistake of motive.

825
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,140
No duplicates, okay?

826
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,050
Okay...

827
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,100
Attorney?

828
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,740
Yes, Advisor? What is it now?

829
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,540
I also went to law school.

830
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,990
Oh, really?

831
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,560
Then, please bring 10 by tomorrow as well, Advisor.

832
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,730
- Pardon?
- By tomorrow.

833
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,610
- But I—
- With no overlap.

834
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,780
- Wait—
- All right, next.

835
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,390
Attorney, I...

836
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,810
Wait, well, gosh...

837
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,910
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

838
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,570
Gosh, he's so intense.

839
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,530
- Goodness. Working hard.
- You keep getting this wrong.

840
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,980
Gosh.

841
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,490
Goodness.

842
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,750
Was the Advisor here, too?

843
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,460
Yeah, but she ran away.

844
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,500
- Why?
- Because I gave her homework.

845
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

846
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,040
Enjoy.

847
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,630
I said not to overuse your highlighters.

848
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,030
Did you read this case, too?

849
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,570
Oh, yes. We read it.

850
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,360
But that case was obviously a scam.

851
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,140
Do people really fall for such a scam?

852
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,800
Are they that stupid?

853
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,260
That case felt a bit fishy to me, too. Wasn't it obvious?

854
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,780
Yeah. Getting scammed like that is on them.

855
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,380
Anyone can be tricked.

856
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,190
So... even you interns should be careful.

857
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,910
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

858
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,810
Looks good.

859
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,940
What brings you to contact me first?

860
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,640
I'm sorry.

861
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,610
I brought the final revised blueprints, the construction breakdown,

862
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,440
and the contract.

863
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,450
I asked for these a while ago.

864
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,750
How could you bring them now?

865
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,440
I'm sorry. I'm ashamed.

866
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,650
Even if you curse me out, I'll take it.

867
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,770
Even so, how could I curse at you?

868
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,560
I need to add this for the progress payment appraisal.

869
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,630
Am I too late?

870
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,400
The appraisal is already finished.

871
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,850
It's too late to add anything now.

872
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,490
Well...

873
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,730
For this...

874
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:32,060
Every time I think about not getting paid for this, I just burn with anger.

875
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,130
I kept avoiding it because I didn't want to think about it,

876
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,110
and ended up like this.

877
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,070
I'm really sorry.

878
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:49,810
What else did you need to add?

879
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,540
Oh, that...

880
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:56,110
The ceiling roof was originally to be a deck plate, but we changed it—

881
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,610
I already included that.

882
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,890
You did, Attorney?

883
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,740
Yes. The construction details listed "deck plate,"

884
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,080
but when I looked it up, it looked different from the site.

885
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,460
Here, you can look at this.

886
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,180
So, I added that to the appraisal.

887
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,550
Oh, and the stairs too.

888
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,320
I added those as well.

889
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,240
I noticed there were two types of stair rebar placement drawings.

890
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,750
The latter one had a different rebar count,

891
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,550
so I included that in the appraisal, too.

892
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,520
I don't think I saw the staircase rebar placement drawing.

893
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,620
Here's the rebar placement drawing.

894
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,640
We have records showing we sent it to the defendant.

895
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,070
Thank you, Attorney.

896
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:41,040
Seriously, how did you notice all that just from those documents?

897
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,400
That's why I need you to pick up when I call you.

898
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,300
I know it's hard emotionally,

899
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,980
but you need to get your construction payment to feel better.

900
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,600
There's no other way to resolve this. Right?

901
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,470
I'll also do my best to the end.

902
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,660
Yes.

903
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,940
Thank you, Attorney.

904
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,530
Thank you.

905
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,460
Oh, this is nice, too.

906
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,440
Should I get off first?

907
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

908
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,280
Hello.

909
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

910
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,960
Should we put these here?

911
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,360
That looks heavy. Let me take that.

912
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,950
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

913
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,420
What is all this?

914
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,210
Just a small gift for Lunar New Year.

915
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,210
I'll leave them here. Everyone, take one.

916
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,590
Happy Lunar New Year.

918
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,210
- Happy Lunar New Year.
- Happy Lunar New Year.

919
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,730
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

920
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,510
- So, how is it?
- It's pretty big.

921
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,860
It's pretty amazing.

922
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,660
Wow, is it fruit?

923
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,020
- Open it quickly!
- Maybe it's Korean beef?

924
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,850
What is that?

925
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,820
All right, I will open it.

926
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,920
Gosh, that scared me!

927
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,420
Gosh, you scared me...

928
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,040
Whoa... it's alive.

929
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,710
What did she get scared of?

930
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,800
Was it from seeing this, or from seeing me?

931
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,690
- Advisor, heading home?
- Hello.

932
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,340
Yes.

933
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,410
Why did you bring all this for us?

934
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,020
Oh, it's just a small Lunar New Year's gift.

935
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,820
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

936
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,340
Sure.

937
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,270
I'm sorry I haven't been able to refer you many cases.

938
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,210
I should do more

939
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:28,410
to make you feel like I'm part of the firm.

940
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,450
I'm sure you'll take better care of us from now on.

941
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,740
Advisor! Thank you for the gift.

942
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,230
Oh, it's nothing.

943
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,710
Just a small Lunar New Year's gift.

944
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,110
I'll enjoy the lobster!

945
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,970
Yes, happy Lunar New Year.

946
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,630
- Happy Lunar New Year.
- Yes.

947
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,070
Oh, Ms. Kim, thank you for the gift!

948
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,240
Can't believe you gave us lobster. Thank you so much!

949
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,930
Yes, Happy Lunar New Year!

950
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:05,550
- Happy Lunar New Year.
- Yes.

951
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:06,620
I'll be off now.

952
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,700
Yes. Go ahead.

953
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,620
Happy Lunar New Year.

954
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,700
Yes, you, too.

955
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,440
Please add avocado, too.

956
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,970
I'll take honey oat for the bread.

957
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,550
And please add shrimp and cheese.

958
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:31,810
American cheese, please.

959
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,280
I'll have 30 cm of the same.

960
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,170
Wow.

961
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,280
Hey, this is good. It's nice.

962
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,130
Hey, are you all going home for the holidays?

963
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,660
- Of course.
- Really?

964
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,300
Hey, you won't get nagged anymore about having a baby now.

965
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,780
I haven't told them yet.

966
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,220
- What?
- Why's that such a secret?

967
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,010
I'll tell them.

968
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,740
I should finally escape the nagging completely.

969
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,000
I already escaped the "When are you getting married" talk.

970
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,940
If I can escape the "When are you having a baby" talk,

971
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,580
it'll be the end of all nagging.

972
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,910
So, do your families all ask why you're not getting married?

973
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,210
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

974
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,860
- You've never heard that?
- I haven't.

975
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,390
Hey, you may be the youngest here,

976
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,650
but you're getting to the age you'll start hearing it.

977
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,130
My parents don't nag me about stuff like that.

978
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:40,210
For my family, my dad is always the one.

979
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,300
Same.

980
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,020
When my mom starts, my dad always gives a final word.

981
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,550
Me, too. Wow, we're exactly the same.

982
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,570
I'm jealous. I don't have a dad.

983
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,300
Geez...

984
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,290
Don't joke about stuff like that.

985
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:58,780
- Ha Sang Ki, seriously, don't do that.
- Ow, that hurts.

986
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,450
Father!

987
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,420
What are you, a kid?

988
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,330
Hey, it's freezing!

989
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,580
Gosh, it's cold.

990
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,580
I guess we'll see each other after the holidays.

991
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,800
- Get some good rest, everyone.
- Yeah.

992
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,850
Don't cry, missing me.

993
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,430
- Hurry up and go.
- I'm off.

994
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,690
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

995
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,870
Gosh, it's cold.

996
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,210
What? What is it?

997
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,940
It's nothing.

998
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,790
Lobster!

999
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,950
- What's with you?
- Lobster.

1000
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,370
My Ji Seok loves it.

1001
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,530
Don't you have any thoughts about marriage?

1002
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:51,760
Why are you so shocked?

1003
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,060
What's with you? Mom, you're not like this.

1004
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,020
I can't even ask you that?

1005
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,310
Dad.

1006
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,800
Don't you want to get married?

1007
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,650
Dad!

1008
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,610
Mom, when is Jung Ki coming?

1009
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:25,360
He said he's coming tomorrow.

1010
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,000
- Where are you going, Mom?
- I have to go to work.

1011
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,400
- But it's the Lunar New Year.
- We're busier on Lunar New Year's.

1012
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,410
Make sure to put that in the fridge.

1013
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:38,060
- Okay.
- I'm heading out.

1014
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,900
Gosh, this is such great news!

1015
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,890
I did well, right?

1016
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,190
Will you have a second child right away?

1017
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,870
What? This is my first. Why talk about a second child?

1018
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,720
Think of your age. Why wouldn't we talk about a second child?

1019
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,880
Dad.

1020
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,960
How will you work after the baby comes?

1021
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,790
Can you take maternity leave or parental leave?

1022
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:16,320
Come on. She's an attorney. Why worry about that?

1023
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,390
Gosh. All of you, be quiet!

1024
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,580
I'll handle it myself.

1025
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:24,860
Uncle, buy us ice cream!

1026
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,740
- Please buy us some.
- Hey!

1027
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:31,130
Uncle! Uncle! Buy us ice cream!

1028
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,660
Okay, Uncle will buy you ice cream.

1029
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,600
Go andsit over there. I'll buy it for you soon.

1030
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,410
Hey, Chang Won.

1031
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,600
Yes?

1032
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,680
I'll call you later.

1033
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,420
Read this over

1034
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,980
and try to argue my case as if you're my attorney.

1035
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,620
- Argue your case?
- Pretend you're in court and give it a shot.

1036
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,770
- Right now?
- Yeah, now.

1037
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:59,510
Do I have to pay you a retainer fee?

1038
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,610
No, it's not like that, but...

1039
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:05,220
Come on, you do this all the time. It should be easy for you.

1040
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:19,420
Aigoo, it looks delicious.

1041
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,800
- Looks so good.
- Looks delicious.

1042
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,910
What time should we go to your aunt's house tomorrow?

1043
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:28,930
I think I need to go into the firm tomorrow.

1044
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,750
Are you that busy?

1045
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,320
Well, I just have a bunch of little things to take care of.

1046
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,680
Yes.

1047
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,380
Yes.

1048
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,230
What are you doing here?

1049
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,920
I thought you'd be spending the entire break with your parents.

1050
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,440
There's not much more to do at home.

1051
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,380
I guess I've become a full-fledged attorney.

1052
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,070
I feel most at ease being at the office.

1053
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,300
What about you?

1054
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,710
I've been a full-fledged attorney for a while now.

1055
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:16,010
Do you... want to go eat?

1056
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,700
Sounds good.

1057
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,640
This way?

1058
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,380
Here?

1059
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:28,940
But don't you smell something savory in the air?

1060
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,650
I was frying pancakes all day.

1061
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,420
Doesn't your family make pancakes?

1062
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,230
We make dumplings.

1063
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,070
Dumplings.

1064
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,320
Don't I smell like dumplings?

1065
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:42,200
Dumplings? Dumplings don't leave a smell.

1066
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,920
Dumplings do leave a smell, like a stew.

1067
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,690
Oh, did you have dumpling stew?

1068
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,060
We had dumpling stew, and...

1069
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,190
Wow, can't believe it's empty here.

1070
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,100
Yeah, nothing's open.

1071
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,130
Maybe there's something near Gangnam Station.

1072
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,790
Wow, Gangnam Station.

1073
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,970
I know a 24-hour place there.

1074
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,930
The day you stood me up,

1075
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,080
I went there alone to eat because it was so cold.

1076
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,480
That place is still open.

1077
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,190
Every time I walk by it, I still get mad.

1078
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:23,250
That's why I couldn't find you.

1079
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,920
Pardon?

1080
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,690
Well...

1081
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,570
I went to Gangnam Station, too.

1082
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,640
Liar.

1083
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,690
Do you think I'm you? Why would I lie?

1084
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,250
Why are you telling me this now?

1085
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,450
Well, I missed the timing to say it.

1086
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,100
It's still unbelievable.

1087
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:52,300
How could you think that I was canceling?

1088
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,310
We definitely promised to see each other again,

1089
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,790
but you asked again if we'd see each other again.

1090
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,300
For me, that was basically a confession.

1091
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,130
We were about to part ways,

1092
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,560
but even though you said we should meet in Seoul,

1093
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,230
you never asked me to date you.

1094
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:15,350
Next time, tell me clearly so I understand.

1095
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,720
Next time when?

1096
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,950
Right now?

1097
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,390
Is this clear enough for you?

1098
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,360
Do you take me for a fool?

1099
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,200
♫  You stood out, shining so brightly  ♫

1100
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:13,380
♫  What began as coincidence  ♫

1101
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:22,430
♫  I hope we are meant to be wrapped in fate  ♫

1102
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:32,620

1103

♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

1104
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:47,700
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

1105
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,600
So what do you want to eat?

1106
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,830
An açaí bowl.

1107
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:57,010
An açaí bowl?

1108
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:58,140
What the...

1109
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,770
What's this?

1110
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,170
What brings you here?

1111
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,910
What is this? Did you guys make plans without me?

1112
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:09,350
Don't be ridiculous.

1113
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:11,840
Why are you here? What about your husband?

1114
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,350
He's sleeping at home.

1115
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,690
Wait, wait, wait.

1116
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,880
So, did we run into each other by coincidence?

1117
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,760
Why is he acting all excited?

1118
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,680
It's exciting! It feels like fate!

1119
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:25,090
It's nice, and it's snowing!

1120
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:28,650
I can't believe nothing is open.

1121
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,990
I thought you said it was open 24 hours.

1122
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,840
- I didn't say 365 days a year.
- Geez.

1123
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,830
Hey.

1124
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:43,290
What are you all doing here?

1125
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,470
What's this?

1126
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,760
What... What's with you two?

1127
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,320
Did you two make plans separately?

1128
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,340
N-No. I came here first,

1129
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,400
and Ju Hyeong was at the office, too.

1130
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,650
No, I was coming to the office,

1131
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,830
and she was standing out in front.

1132
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,230
- What are you saying?
- Suspicious.

1133
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:00,560
Hey, forget it. Let's just eat.

1134
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,420
- I'll have this one.
- Yeah.

1135
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,770
I thought two pizzas would be too much, but it worked out. Let's eat.

1136
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,150
Hey. Aren't you curious why we're here?

1137
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,630
Isn't it obvious?

1138
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,590
Hey, I forgot to take a photo. Wait.

1139
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:15,220
I took one. I'll send it to you later.

1140
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,600
But I have my own vibe.

1141
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,220
I took a good one.

1142
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,380
Thanks.

1143
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,940
It feels nice to be back in the lounge.

1144
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,710
Yeah.

1145
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,250
I feel most comfortable here.

1146
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,150
The snow is really coming down.

1147
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,840
Yeah, Mom.

1148
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,950
What?

What do you mean you don't have it?

1155
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,710
You got what I sent through President Park!

1156
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,010
No way...

1157
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,700
Your father was in a holding cell.

1158
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,650
Are you okay? You're going through a big ordeal.

1159
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,430
You're not thinking of representing me, are you?

1160
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,950
Dad!

1161
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:59,290
Don't come anymore, okay?

1162
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,410
Wait, do you believe this contract is real?

1163
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,900
This is Hui Ji's dad.

1164
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,050
Aren't you treating him too much like any client?

1165
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,690
This is an attorney visit.

1166
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,420
Please tell him to come out. Please.
