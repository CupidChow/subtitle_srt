1
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,600
- Hello?
- Hey.

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,480
I-Is this Ju Hyeong?

3
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,570
Yeah, it's been a while.

4
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,800
Y-Yeah, how've you been?

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,350
I've been doing okay.

6
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,660
- What's up?
- Well...

7
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,520
it's a bit awkward to say, but...

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,700
I was briefly seeing this female business client,

9
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,360
and it turned out she was married.

10
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,720
Yeah, and?

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,440
Well, so now her husband is...

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,050
spreading rumors at my company that I'm the guy she cheated with.

13
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,000
Is there any way to stop these rumors from spreading?

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,910
It's hard to stop that physically.

15
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,200
You can't follow everyone around and shut their mouths.

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,940
Is there something I can do legally?

17
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,200
You probably can't stop it directly.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,690
- Did he sue you for the affair?
- He hasn't filed one yet.

19
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,620
But if I didn't know she was married,

20
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,150
wouldn't I be okay even if he sued me?

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,750
You didn't know?

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,200
Seriously, I had no idea.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,450
I even have texts saying she was single and lied.

24
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,430
Then you'll probably be fine.

25
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,190
If you want to sue for defamation, let me know.

26
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,410
I'll introduce you to another attorney.

27
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,700
It depends on where the leak is coming from,

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,230
whether it's from the upstairs pipes or a shared line.

29
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,950
The liability will be different depending on that.

30
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,700
Yeah, we'd have to open it up to know for sure.

31
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,160
I don't know.

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm an attorney, not a plumber.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah, okay. Bye.

34
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,870
Gosh, seriously.

35
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,400
Yeah.

36
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,370
Is there a reason to sue the security guard?

37
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,500
About the law school internship program I mentioned before,

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,470
are you all okay with it?

39
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,270
We don't have the capacity for that.

40
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,200
And it'll cost a lot in small ways.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,030
- Who's covering the expenses?
- Don't worry about that.

42
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,880
I'll handle it so you won't have to worry.

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,290
Okay, if that's the case.

44
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,660
I don't really have a reason to object,

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,310
but I'm not sure why we should do it, either.

46
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,410
I've never done it before and don't really know how it works,

47
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,830
so I'm not very interested.

48
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,320
It's important to promote the firm to clients,

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,830
but we should also build connections with potential future attorneys

50
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,160
if we want to get good attorneys in the future.

51
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,550
You speak as if you really are a part of our firm.

52
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm grateful to you for helping our firm grow in size,

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,970
but that doesn't mean you're actually part of our firm.

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,110
I think that last comment crossed the line a bit.

55
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,240
And there's no mention of the cases you promised to refer.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,920
Well, I think it'd be great if law students

57
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,240
learned about our firm.

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,650
Don't you think, partners?

59
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,540
- I won't object, either.
- Same here.

60
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,760
Yeah, sounds great. It's great.

61
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,600
Who doesn't know that it will be great?

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm not objecting, either.

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,550
As long as you take care of everything.

64
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,560
Thank you so much.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,630
I'll do my best to make it go smoothly.

66
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,800
Can I order dessert?

67
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,040
Of course.

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,050
Do you eat meringue?

69
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,200
- Meringue...
- Pardon?

70
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,230
Oh, yes, thank you.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,140
E-Excuse me, the grand opening...

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,320
Yes, here.

73
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,460
Oh, okay.

74
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,730
Here, thank you...

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,060
Yes, it's the grand opening...

76
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,920
Here you go. Yes.

77
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,150
Hello.

78
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,200
- Hello!
- Hello!

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,930
Please, take a seat. Take a seat.

80
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,810
Welcome to Law Group Hyungmin.

81
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,180
Thank you, Attorney.

82
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,970
Oh, I'm not an attorney.

83
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm an advisor, yes, an advisor.

84
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,930
Oh, you're not an attorney?

85
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,670
Then, when will the other attorneys get here?

86
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,990
Follow me. I'll introduce them to you.

87
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,120
- Oh, okay, okay!
- Sounds good!

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,540
Are you busy, Attorney?

89
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,990
Oh, hello, Advisor.

90
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,550
The internship starts today,

91
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,130
so I was wondering if I can introduce them to you?

92
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,140
Oh, yes, yes.

93
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,350
Hello.

94
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,350
- Hello!
- Hello!

95
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,520
This is Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,170
I look forward to working with you.

97
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,030
- I look forward to working with you!
- I look forward to working with you!

98
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,360
- I look forward to working with you as well.
- Yes...

99
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,980
- Goodbye.
- Okay, goodbye.

100
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,610
And if it's okay, could I borrow a few closed-case files?

101
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,950
I'd like for the students to take a look.

102
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,840
Oh, thank you, Attorney.

103
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,420
If you have time, please stop by and check on them.

104
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,450
You can give them a simple assignment, too.

105
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,800
Yes, will do.

106
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes?

107
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,330
Attorney, the court-appointed defendant has arrived.

108
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh, right. They're in the conference room, right?

109
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm sorry, I could only hire you

110
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,880
as a public defender because of my financial situation.

111
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,270
No, no. Don't worry about that.

112
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,440
You've been indicted for aiding and abetting fraud.

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,050
You know what this charge is about, right?

114
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,020
Indicted? What does that mean, Attorney?

115
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,910
I read it, but I don't understand any of it.

116
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,850
The prosecution has formally accused you of committing a crime

117
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,980
and has brought your case to trial.

118
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,590
That's what "indicted" means.

119
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,650
The charge is aiding and abetting fraud.

120
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,560
I know what fraud is, but what's "abetting"?

121
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,100
Does that mean I just stood by while the fraud happened?

122
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,270
That's a common misunderstanding.

123
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,290
But it doesn't mean you stood by. It means you helped.

124
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,200
It's basically acting as an accomplice.

125
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,420
You're saying I helped with fraud?

126
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,240
Yes. It says here you were involved in voice phishing,

127
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,220
that you acted as a "cash mule."

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,800
That means you withdrew the scammed money and handed it over.

129
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,510
No, all I did was try to get a loan.

130
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,050
It says you received a text about a loan from someone named Deputy Baek Jeong Hyeon

131
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,730
from BX Bank and talked to him on the phone.

132
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,480
Do you remember the conversation?

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,810
Yes. At first, he said it would be hard to get a loan,

134
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,500
but he said he'd make a special exception to get me a loan.

135
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,900
Your credit score is low because your account doesn't have much activity.

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,990
We'll help you build a transaction history first.

137
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,580
In my bank account?

138
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,050
I'm offering this because I trust you, Ms. Do.

139
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,850
Here you go.

140
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,520
I'll deposit money into your account to create some transaction records.

141
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,110
Thank you.

142
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,530
But you must not keep that money.

143
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,360
You have to return it to me. Okay?

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,900
- Good job.
- Thank you.

145
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,510
Thank you.

146
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
But they didn't give me the loan in the end.

147
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,040
Do you happen to have a recording of that call?

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,890
I'm not sure.

149
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,100
- Could I check your phone again really quick?
- Oh, yes, yes.

150
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,120
This was last November, so...

151
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,880
Oh, here it is.

152
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,040
Hello, this is BX Bank Deputy Baek Jeong Hyeon.

153
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,730
How can I help you?

154
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,780
I'm calling after receiving your text.

155
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,240
It was recorded.

156
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,780
You were alone at the police investigation, right?

157
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,930
Yes.

158
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,320
You were probably indicted because your explanation wasn't properly communicated.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,290
If this recording had been submitted, it would've been clear

160
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,340
you were deceived and not an accomplice.

161
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,310
Then, will I be okay?

162
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,920
I wasn't involved in this voice phishing thing, right?

163
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,330
Well, it's true that the voice phishing victims

164
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,450
transferred money into your account.

165
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,610
And you did withdraw that money

166
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,030
and deliver it to the fraudsters.

167
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,030
But you didn't know that's what it was.

168
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,890
I didn't know.

169
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,380
Actually, I wondered if this was a scam like voice phishing,

170
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,910
so I asked them, but they said it wasn't.

171
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,660
It's not like he was demanding money from me.

172
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,890
He was just offering a loan, so I believed him.

173
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,880
Don't worry too much.

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,940
Once I download and submit this recording,

175
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,420
you'll likely be found not guilty.

176
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,840
Goodness! Thank you, Attorney.

177
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,880
Voice phishing ringleaders are usually overseas.

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,860
So the authorities go after the cash mules first

179
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,570
and give them heavy sentences.

180
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,710
I hear they serve years in prison.

181
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,570
Even so, she didn't even know she was used as a cash mule.

182
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,390
How could they investigate carelessly and charge someone like her?

183
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,440
Is that guy still not answering?

184
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,940
No. I'm so annoyed.

185
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,270
If I ever catch that jerk, I swear...

186
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,990
That jerk—  that guy who didn't get paid for the construction?

187
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,870
Yeah.

188
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,670
The on-site evaluation is tomorrow. What's he doing?

189
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,870
He wouldn't provide the documents, and I can't reach him.

190
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,310
He can't just dump the lawsuit.

191
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,630
Calm down, calm down.

192
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,540
The project wasn't even finished.

193
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,340
The construction was halted due to a payment dispute.

194
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,550
We need someone who actually knows what happened on-site.

195
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,110
The client is chill while I'm the one freaking out.

196
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,690
Anyone would think I'm the one who didn't get paid.

197
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,160
That's what I thought, honestly.

198
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,540
Still, it's nice being at a café for once.

199
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,040
We've only been hanging out at the lounge these days.

200
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,710
Are the interns staying in the lounge?

201
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,820
Yeah. Did they stop by your office, too?

202
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,850
They asked us to review their work periodically.

203
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,570
- Yeah, they came by.
- Was I that baby-faced when I was in law school?

204
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,000
I guess they were kind of cute.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,030
They didn't come to me, though.

206
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,450
Hey.

207
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,230
I guess the Advisor figured out that you're a brat.

208
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,860
What are you going to do now?

209
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,530
I was out this morning. They must've come by then.

210
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,680
But shouldn't we at least throw a welcome dinner?

211
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,520
I can't today.

212
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,510
That contractor probably won't show up tomorrow.

213
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,870
I should at least comb through all the materials tonight.

214
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,400
How about tomorrow?

215
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,820
I've got plans.

216
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,150
- With whom?
- He has a high school reunion.

217
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,050
My husband insisted on going there, even though

218
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,060
his wife is in early pregnancy.

219
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,750
He used you as an excuse to go

220
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,790
saying it was rare for you to show up.

221
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,310
He said to make sure I come, so he could use me as his excuse.

222
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,710
He'd buy to celebrate the pregnancy.

223
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,820
Give me a break.

224
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,680
Is he the one who's pregnant?

225
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,900
Then, I'll make plans for tomorrow, too.

226
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,120
Let's do the welcome dinner tomorrow.

227
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,300
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, let's do it tomorrow.

228
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,000
Ju Hyeong doesn't have to be there since the Advisor didn't ask him.

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,320
Right?

230
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,810
I told you, I was out when they came.

231
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,770
- Hello!
- Hello!

232
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,460
No need to be so formal with us.

233
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,880
Please sit down. It's not like I'm your professor or boss.

234
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,140
Please sit. Please sit.

235
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,440
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're sitting.

236
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,360
Just kidding. Kidding. Please sit.

237
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,180
Oh, okay.

238
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,470
Did you read this as well?

239
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,820
No, I haven't yet.

240
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,620
I handled this case.

241
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,030
- Oh, my.
- Amazing.

242
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,630
If you're up for it, how about writing a case report?

243
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,420
- Sounds good. I'll try writing one.
- Me, too!

244
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,190
If anything's unclear, I can review it briefly.

245
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,500
This can seem like a word play.

246
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,880
But the sentence structure is...

247
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,200
- Deputy?
- Yes?

248
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,160
Could you copy the evidence records from today's court-appointed case?

249
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,390
Sure.

250
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,870
Wait, Ms. Kim.

251
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,780
- This is a court-appointed case, right?
- Yes.

252
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,800
Make the copies yourself for court-appointed cases. Don't ask other staff.

253
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,400
But we've always done it this way.

254
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,870
And you've approved it, too.

255
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah, stop doing that now.

256
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,390
Technically speaking, court-appointed cases aren't firm cases.

257
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,810
They're your personal cases, Attorney Jo.

258
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,020
But the firm still gets public service hours out of it.

259
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,750
I'm fulfilling that through these cases.

260
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,210
Does the case fee come to the firm?

261
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,500
They go to you.

262
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,590
Ms. Kim, don't worry about the court-appointed cases from now on.

263
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,790
- Okay.
- All right.

264
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,180
Water the plants instead.

265
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,010
I'll take care of it.

266
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,760
Thank you.

267
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,360
- Your credit score is too low.
- I guess getting a loan will be hard.

268
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,660
We can help you.

269
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm offering this because I trust you, Ms. Do.

270
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,300
Wait, they indicted her even with all this?

271
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,910
Gosh.

272
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,210
Why do they always come in when I'm taking a short break

273
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,640
and scare the crap out of me?

274
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,890
Why did you get so startled?

275
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,160
Were you watching something weird?

276
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
No.

277
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,270
But what's up?

278
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,840
Just because.

279
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,820
- Are you super busy?
- Yeah.

280
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,980
Because of the evaluation tomorrow.

281
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,750
The construction details changed multiple times, so I need to be well-prepared,

282
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,650
but since the client's not cooperating,

283
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,430
I'm stuck like this.

284
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,330
But is it okay for you to be working this late?

285
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,690
Why not? I often work through the night.

286
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,530
But shouldn't you stop doing that now?

287
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,480
Because of the baby?

288
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,690
Is that right?

289
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,860
Your belly looks like it's bulging a little, too.

290
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,380
It's not.

291
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,510
It's only been a few weeks. Why would it bulge already?

292
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,810
- It's not?
- It's not!

293
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,350
Okay.

294
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,400
What are you doing here this late?

295
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,930
I'm working on that voice phishing case I mentioned earlier.

296
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,860
That case seemed simple.

297
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,280
Why are you still stuck on it?

298
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,870
It's not that simple after all.

299
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,240
It should've been an easy case to defend,

300
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,230
but they went ahead and indicted her even though there was

301
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,720
clear evidence of innocence.

302
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,310
Yeah, since voice phishing is still a huge problem,

303
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,190
they're cracking down pretty hard.

304
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,490
Exactly. That's why I'm worried.

305
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,210
Even though it seems like a reckless indictment,

306
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,390
I'm afraid she'll still be found guilty.

307
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,150
Gosh, seriously.

308
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,540
They can't catch actual criminals like Jang Su Gil.

309
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,600
You're done being a visitation attorney, right?

310
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,450
Yeah. Hey, it was the first time

311
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,160
I wanted the prosecution to catch my client.

312
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,550
No, technically, I wasn't his attorney,

313
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,100
so he wasn't even my client.

314
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,590
Gosh, don't overthink it. Just forget about it.

315
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,360
It bothers me that they're charging innocent people

316
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,760
instead of catching jerks like him.

317
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,630
- The customer is not answering the phone.
- Geez.

318
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,750
After the beep...

319
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,410
He's still not picking up.

320
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,610
On behalf of the defendant's construction team, right?

321
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,940
Yes.

322
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,910
Are you the only one on the plaintiff's side, Attorney?

323
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,950
Yes.

324
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,580
Really?

325
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,630
Then, let's get started.

326
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,000
Please wear this.

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
Okay.

328
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,210
What material was the flooring supposed to be?

329
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,760
Well, mortar.

330
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,500
- Self-leveling type?
- Yes.

331
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,070
What was the ceiling finish supposed to be?

332
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,260
Sheet Molding Compound.

333
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,530
And all the piping was going to go through here?

334
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,670
Well, yes.

335
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,580
How far apart are the stirrups spaced?

336
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,950
I'm not sure.

337
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,410
It should be noted in the blueprints.

338
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,170
W-W-Wait...

339
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,770
Here, you can look at this.

340
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,190
- Is this the blueprint?
- Yes.

341
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,510
I don't think I saw the staircase rebar placement drawing.

342
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,140
Me neither.

343
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,420
They never showed it to us.

344
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,700
Here's the rebar placement drawing.

345
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,390
We have records showing we sent it to the defendant.

346
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,510
You never sent it to us.

347
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,370
I sent it.

348
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,270
Look. There's even the email record.

349
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,880
Great work, everyone.

350
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,540
I'll submit the evaluation report quickly.

351
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,530
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

352
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,390
And what was the original plan for paving the access road?

353
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,100
- Oh, that…
- Asphalt concrete.

354
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,350
What was the aggregate size for the surface layer?

355
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,440
13mm.

356
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,250
That was the original plan.

357
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,760
13mm.

358
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,160
Okay.

359
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,710
Attention passengers.

360
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,320
This train has designated priority seats

361
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,240
for transportation-vulnerable passengers,

362
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,680
including those with disabilities, pregnant women,

363
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,060
and passengers with young children.

364
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,460
Please be especially considerate of early-stage pregnant women

365
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,110
whose pregnancy may not be visibly apparent.

366
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,300
Thank you.

367
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,020
Where do you get one of these?

368
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,120
Pardon?

369
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,360
I recently became pregnant, but I don't know much about this stuff.

370
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,230
Oh, really? Congratulations.

371
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,380
How far along are you?

372
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
32 weeks now.

373
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,950
You don't have much longer to go.

374
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,290
It must be really tough, right?

375
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,860
No, I'm still doing okay for now.

376
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,780
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

377
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,270
But seriously, where do you get one of these?

378
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,620
Gosh, seriously.

379
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,270
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

380
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,070
Did someone ask you to rush this?

381
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,230
Attorney Ha Sang Ki asked us to try writing a case report.

382
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,770
What are you all doing? Let's go.

383
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,610
Senior, did you tell them to finish this by today?

384
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,840
Yeah.

385
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,550
What's this? You still haven't finished yet? I gave you plenty of time.

386
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,900
At this rate, we won't make it to the welcome dinner.

387
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,730
You can complete this by tomorrow.

388
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,150
Attorney Ha, they can finish this by tomorrow. Right?

389
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,410
By tomorrow... morning.

390
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,720
- Gosh.
- Come on!

391
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,400
Just get it done by tomorrow. End of day. Take your time.

392
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,210
- Let's go. Move, move, move!
- Hey.

393
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,540
Hey, what about Ju Hyeong?

394
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,460
- He had a school reunion, remember?
- Oh, right.

395
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,530
Oh, you got one.

396
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,240
It's pretty, it's pretty.

397
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,660
It's cute.

398
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,000
Hey, long time no see!

399
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,280
Hey, Ju Hyeong!

400
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,890
What the...

401
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,540
J-Ju Hyeong's here, too...

402
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,880
Didn't I tell you? I told him he had to come.

403
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,310
It's been a while, guys.

404
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,540
Yeah, it's been a while.

405
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,270
Goodness, everyone's here on time.

406
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,540
Oh, Ji Hun.

407
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,060
Hey, An Ju Hyeong, how long has it been?

408
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,300
Was it early July of 2021?

409
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,120
Isn't this the first time since you showed up briefly in the Sinsa area and

410
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,630
left before the second round?

411
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,050
- Is it?
- How do you remember everything like that?

412
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,130
Of course I do.

413
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,190
I even remember the song you sang at karaoke that night.

414
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,710
- You're drinking makgeolli, right?
- Yeah.

415
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,520
- No.
- Just have makgeolli.

416
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,340
Excuse me, one makgeolli here, please.

417
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,100
Okay.

418
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,580
But if I didn't know she was married,

419
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,700
wouldn't I be okay even if he sued me?

420
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,720
Ju Hyeong, what do I need to prepare

421
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,180
to get the upper hand in a divorce?

422
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,380
Is there any way I can get my money back?

423
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,370
I'm going to the restroom.

424
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

425
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,850
Your tie is so tacky.

426
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,000
- I need to go, too.
- Okay.

427
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,700
Hey, people call this...

428
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,500
Ju Hyeong.

429
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,230
I decided to try and

430
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,960
work things out with my wife.

431
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,860
I'm just saying thanks.

432
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,400
- For what?
- I asked you about it last time.

433
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,990
Things weren't good with my wife.

434
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,670
Oh, did you?

435
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,040
Sorry, I've been out of it lately.

436
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,100
If you don't remember, even better.

437
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,220
But man, you're so indifferent.

438
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,700
Can't I choose a pretty one?

439
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,260
How old are you that you're picking pink?

440
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,830
So childish. Seriously.

441
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,500
I won't even respond to that.

442
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,430
How do you all still look so good?

443
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,900
You must all be doing well.

444
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,600
What's there to worry about?

445
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,330
Yeah.

446
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,840
You know our lives are pretty calm.

447
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,300
Smooth sailing.

448
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,980
Right, except for him.

449
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,300
Him?

450
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,490
Huh?

451
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,770
Hey, so did that get resolved?

452
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,220
W-What do you mean?

453
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,000
The affair with the married woman!

454
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,740
What was that head shake just now?

455
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,350
This is unbelievable.

456
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:34,310
Hey, having an affair with a married woman calls for people to shake their heads.

457
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,210
- You took it too far, man.
- Yeah.

458
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,200
I told you I didn't know she was married.

459
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,450
You're an attorney, yet you go around blabbing about people's dirty laundry?

460
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,530
I was wondering why you came tonight.

461
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,360
You came to see this, huh?

462
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,530
Wait, what?

463
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,980
You told Ju Hyeong about this?

464
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,830
I have no idea what you're talking about.

465
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,670
Then, where did you hear that?

466
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,220
The word has spread all over our office.

467
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,240
You're the hottest gossip in every workplace these days.

468
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,720
That was him?

469
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,830
It was him?

470
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,860
Hey, please go around telling people it's not me!

471
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,980
I'm losing my mind over this!

472
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,990
But shouldn't you apologize to Ju Hyeong?

473
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,660
Fine, sorry about that.

474
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,510
- Do it properly.
- Do it properly if you're going to.

475
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,750
Don't just go through the motions.

476
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,520
Gosh, I'll handle it! Leave me alone.

477
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,380
- It's fine.
- No...

478
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,660
it's not fine—

479
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,570
Okay, okay, let's toast. Cheers.

480
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,280
Anyway, great work today.

481
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,840
Even though you drank, go and review some cases.

482
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,080
- Enough, enough.
- Hey, hey!

483
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,650
- Thanks for the food!
- Thanks for the food!

484
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,480
- Thanks for the food!
- Thanks for the food!

485
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,780
Anytime, anytime.

486
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,160
We'll get going first, then.

487
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,920
- Get home safely.
- Great work today.

488
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,700
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

489
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,520
Let's go.

490
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,220
What?

491
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,990
Sad it's over? Should we go for round two?

492
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,270
Round two?

493
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,750
I'm down. Where to?

494
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,120
- Want to go where Ju Hyeong is?
- Sounds good!

495
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,110
Remember when that freshman fell for that older department rep girl

496
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,720
and was asking what he should do?

497
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,200
Mun Jeong!

498
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,180
- What are you doing here?
- Did you drink a lot?

499
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,600
No, no.

500
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,390
Oh, hello.

501
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,840
Congratulations, ma'am!

502
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,450
- Let me introduce you.
- No, it's fine.

503
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,770
Please, have a seat.

504
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,960
- Oh, hi.
- Come, come, come.

505
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,470
- What, why, why?
- No, it's fine.

506
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,990
Can't we drink together? I thought we were sitting with them.

507
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,510
- No, no, no, no. Sit here.
- See you later!

508
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,840
Sit here instead.

509
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,820
Be good to your wife, man.

510
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,920
I am.

511
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,520
Hey, that girl.

512
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,660
Isn't she the girl you met on your trip during law school?

513
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,250
Or is it someone who looks like her?

514
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,710
No, it is her. She is that girl—

515
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,540
What the, what happened?

516
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,580
Who? Attorney Kang?

517
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,610
We just happened to end up working in the same building.

518
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,850
You were freaking out, saying you met someone you liked

519
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,410
and sent us her photos, asking what you should do.

520
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,790
What? You two were like that?

521
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,640
No, we just work together.

522
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,590
- You know her, too?
- Yeah, last time, he called me

523
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,840
late at night, asking me to help her.

524
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,540
That's amazing.

525
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,400
What? Are you trying to get back with her again?

526
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,360
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

527
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,520
Really? Are you sure?

528
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,820
Yeah.

529
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,120
- Are you sure?
- No idea.

530
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,650
Then, introduce me.

531
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,940
- What?
- No.

532
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Why not?

533
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,610
She doesn't like blind dates. She despises them.

534
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,490
She's into those natural encounters, I see.

535
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,540
Let's not just do this yearly. Let's meet up more often.

536
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,640
Yeah, let's see each other more.

537
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,160
And stop sulking all the time.

538
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,450
Are you coming to the next hangout?

539
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,680
Who knows? Depends.

540
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,650
Why? Should I not come?

541
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,510
Come on, no.

542
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,010
That's not what I meant.

543
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,940
Hey, Mun Jeong!

544
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,150
These are my old classmates.

545
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,820
And these are my friends.

546
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,980
Nice to meet you.

547
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,690
I really appreciated your help last time,

548
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,880
but I couldn't make the dinner. I'm sorry.

549
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,530
Oh, no, don't worry.

550
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,750
Ju Hyeong paid for the dinner that day.

551
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,450
Oh, now I see why you paid.

552
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,450
For Ju Hyeong to feel empathetic toward Attorney Kang...

553
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,680
I hear I'm slow when it comes to reading the room.

554
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,880
It turns out that ever since Hong Kong, this guy and Attorney Kang—

555
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,550
Hey, Mun Jeong is looking for you.

556
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,060
Hello. I'm Min Ji Hoon, Ju Hyeong's friend.

557
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,690
I see. Hello.

558
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,270
I heard you don't like blind dates—

559
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,080
Hey, if you're drunk, just go home.

560
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll properly introduce myself next time, for sure.

561
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,590
- Go, go.
- Let's go.

562
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,960
- Okay, we're leaving.
- Goodbye.

563
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,060
- All right, see you.
- We're off, too.

564
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,850
- Get home safely!
- See you!

565
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,980
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

566
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,110
- So, are you taking the bus?
- Yeah.

567
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,670
I think I'll take the bus tonight, too.

568
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,270
All right, okay. For us,

569
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,940
- the subway.
- See you.

570
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,330
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Bye!

571
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,990
Shall we go, too?

572
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,560
What was that blind date talk about earlier?

573
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
Blind date?

574
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,980
When Ji Hun saw Attorney Kang earlier at the bar,

575
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,630
he asked to be set up.

576
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,810
I heard something about her hating blind dates.

577
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,100
Ju Hyeong said so.

578
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,810
That he can't, since Attorney Kang hates blind dates.

579
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,150
Look at this guy...

580
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,370
It's not true?

581
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,150
- No, it's true.
- Right?

582
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,250
She seems that way.

583
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,560
What's that in your hand?

584
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,800
French fries.

585
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,150
What?

586
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,670
I saw you enjoying them earlier.

587
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,540
You couldn't even eat lately with your morning sickness.

588
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,510
So, this whole bag is fries?

589
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,600
Yeah.

590
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,920
Are you crazy?

591
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,760
That's enough to last a week!

592
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,930
Yeah. Okay, got it.

593
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,000
Let me know if you need anything else.

594
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,570
And tell me how it turns out.

595
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,690
Okay.

596
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,450
Was that a friend?

597
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,600
Yes. Lately, a lot of my friends have things going on.

598
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,210
They keep calling to ask legal stuff.

599
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,570
Are you very close to them?

600
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,820
I'm pretty close to them.

601
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,310
Then, don't follow up on how it turns out.

602
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,810
Pardon?

603
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,510
If you can erase it all from your memory, even better.

604
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,870
Why?

605
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,380
Because it can create distance.

606
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,540
But we're friends. Shouldn't I check in on how they're doing?

607
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,420
Won't it be even more alienating if I act indifferently?

608
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,300
If it's something bad, being indifferent helps the relationship.

609
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,580
They're asking you now because it's urgent.

610
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,130
But in the end, no one wants to be around someone

611
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,720
who knows about their bad moments.

612
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,110
Is that so?

613
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,370
Did you not enjoy the reunion earlier?

614
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,610
- Do I look like I didn't?
- A little?

615
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,160
That's odd. I'm pretty happy right now.

616
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,030
Why do I look like I didn't?

617
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,840
You look happy now.

618
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,480
But why did you tell them I hate blind dates?

619
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,280
If your friends even remember,

620
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,540
you must've really enjoyed your time with me in Hong Kong.

621
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,560
I'm not sure what you mean.

622
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,010
I heard everything earlier.

623
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,410
- Well, about that...
- So,

624
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,300
what are some moments you enjoyed so much?

625
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,650
Hey, do you...

626
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,690
want to grab something to eat?

627
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,070
Sure.

628
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,980
Thank you.

629
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,380
Take a look at the menu.

630
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,150
Do you have any recommendations here?

631
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,550
You speak English?

632
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,770
I can't understand you.

633
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,230
You don't speak Cantonese?

634
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,060
Noodles or rice?

635
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,950
This fried egg is good. This is a pork chop.

636
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,950
Rice bowls are good, too. Okay.

637
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,570
Is beef noodle soup okay?

638
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,460
Yes, sounds good.

639
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,510
This is steak.

640
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,910
Oh, you meant the "Sweet Sweet" dish! Okay.

641
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,020
Please wait a moment.

642
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,720
Your pronunciation is really good.

643
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,480
I've been all over the place for lessons since I was young.

644
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,960
I majored in piano.

645
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,000
I actually came here for a performance gig to fill in for a friend.

646
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,490
I guess you know a lot of Chinese characters, too.

647
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,990
Oh, law books have a lot of them. Right?

648
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,150
Oh, no.

649
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,640
It's because I studied them for years with worksheets as a kid.

650
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,530
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

651
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,950
- Yes.
- How did you find this place?

652
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,420
"Comrades: Almost a Love Story."

653
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,700
Someone said it looked like a place from that movie.

654
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,760
Oh, you don't like Hong Kong films?

655
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't really know much about them.

656
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,820
Wait a second.

657
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,450
These are all the places from the movie.

658
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,270
You're going to visit all of these places?

659
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,540
Wow. Where are we right now?

660
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,510
We're at the gang's base.

661
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,690
Here's your Sweet Sweet dishes!

662
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,640
This one's for the lady, and this one's for the gentleman.

663
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,750
Looks delicious!

664
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,580
♫  In a sea of unfamiliar lights  ♫

665
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,120
Stop, stop!

666
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,900
Stop!

667
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,300
♫  You stood out, shining so brightly  ♫

668
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,350
♫  What began as coincidence  ♫

669
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:44,930
♫  I hope we are meant to be wrapped in fate  ♫

670
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:54,970
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

671
00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:01,460
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

672
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:11,150
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

673
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:19,700
♫  That it was nice to meet you, and I liked you  ♫

674
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,670
Shall we go?

675
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:34,000
♫  You still approach me with gentle warmth  ♫

676
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:45,100
♫  You and I from back then, if we ever meet again  ♫

677
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,470
♫  I want to say to you  ♫

678
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:59,490
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

679
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:05,480
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

680
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,770
So...

681
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,520
do you think we'll see each other when we're back in Seoul?

682
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,300
We agreed to see each other again when we got to Seoul.

683
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,790
We haven't really decided for sure yet, have we?

684
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,540
We could just be on a high of being on a trip.

685
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:39,800
♫  Though you may not want to hear this  ♫

686
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:47,920
♫  These are the words I've kept in my heart  ♫

687
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:56,220
♫  I've liked you since then  ♫

688
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,560
So, I'm asking you which moment you enjoyed.

689
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,950
Everything I just mentioned.

690
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,650
I told you because you asked what moment I enjoyed.

691
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,000
- Everything?
- Yes.

692
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,380
Come on.

693
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,320
How come you don't even remember this?

694
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,260
I've had this on forever. You couldn't see this?

695
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,680
- You seriously didn't see this?
- Stop shaking your hand.

696
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,710
How could I not know this? I bought it for you.

697
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,990
- Let's go.
- Yes.

698
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,780
The defendant is accused of aiding and abetting

699
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:15,840
voice phishing fraud committed by unidentified individuals.

700
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,260
Defense Counsel,

701
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,480
please state your opinion on the charges and evidence.

702
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,430
We deny the charges and agree to the evidence submitted

703
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,510
but deny its implication of guilt.

704
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,690
Understood.

705
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,440
We'll proceed with the evidence review.

706
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,320
Okay, the evidence review is complete.

707
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,480
Prosecution, your sentencing recommendation?

708
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,050
Yes, Counsel?

709
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,870
We'd like to conduct an examination of the defendant.

710
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,140
An examination of the defendant?

711
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,070
I forgot to ask that.

712
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,950
But do you really need to?

713
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,780
Why don't you just cover it in your closing?

714
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,830
Still, I'd appreciate the opportunity to let the defendant explain

715
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,010
what happened in her own words.

716
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,400
When you first received the loan text,

717
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,870
you thought it was from a real bank. Right?

718
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,930
Yes.

719
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,950
When the person pretending to be a bank employee said

720
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,620
they'd create a transaction history to get you the loan,

721
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,770
you believed it?

722
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,890
Yes, I didn't know it was a scam,

723
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,520
even while I was being investigated by the police.

724
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,040
You didn't gain anything from this in the end, correct?

725
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,060
No, in the end, I didn't even get the loan.

726
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,290
I got nothing for this.

727
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,560
You were also deceived by the one impersonating Deputy Baek Jeong Hyeon, correct?

728
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,710
Yes, I think so.

729
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,650
That is all.

730
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,760
Prosecutor, would you like a cross-examination?

731
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,020
Yes, I'll just ask one question.

732
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,180
Defendant,

733
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,670
you asked the unidentified individual if this was voice phishing, correct?

734
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,210
Yes, I did.

735
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,080
That is all.

736
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,680
I'd like a re-direct examination.

737
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,650
Please keep it short.

738
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,720
When you asked that question,

739
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,880
he said it wasn't voice phishing

740
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,720
and said to forget it if you don't want a loan. Right?

741
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,870
Yes, he clearly denied it.

742
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,630
The reason you asked if it was voice phishing

743
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,220
was because you suspected they might ask you for money.

744
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,530
Yes, that's right.

745
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,490
I briefly worried that they might try to extort money from me.

746
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,550
But they didn't ask me for money, so I assumed it was legit.

747
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,020
Rather, they said they'd give me their money

748
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,980
to build my transaction history, so I was grateful.

749
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,340
- That is all.
- Defendant, please return to your seat.

750
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,980
Prosecutor, give us your sentencing recommendation.

751
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,520
Okay.

752
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:57,620
We request a fine of 15 million won for the defendant.

753
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,730
Defense Counsel, give us your closing statement.

754
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,740
The defendant, Do Mi Gyeong, was in serious financial hardship.

755
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,250
So the loan ad that promised approval despite

756
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,330
low credit must have been appealing.

757
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,920
More than just appealing, it probably felt like her only hope.

758
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,040
I agree with the prosecution's intent to prevent voice phishing

759
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,190
by catching and punishing the cash mules

760
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,250
since the ringleaders are hard to catch.

761
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,400
However, nitpicking her question, "Is this voice phishing?"

762
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,180
and using it as a pretext to apply the legal theory of dolus eventualis

763
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,300
to forcefully label the defendant as an accomplice

764
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,830
when she didn't even know she was a cash mule

765
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,510
is not appropriate.

766
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,940
The defendant was also deceived into making the withdrawals.

767
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,280
There are transcripts of the call in the evidence records.

768
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,810
Don't you know this as well, Prosecutor?

769
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,700
Isn't that why you asked for a relatively low penalty?

770
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,040
You might think, "How could anyone not know?"

771
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,500
But not everyone understands the structure of voice phishing.

772
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,730
It's possible not to know and be deceived as a result.

773
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,830
But you can't call that a crime.

774
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,280
Thus, please recognize that the defendant

775
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,980
had no intent to assist in fraud,

776
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,580
and find her not guilty.

777
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,680
That is all.

778
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,160
Second, careful review.

779
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,290
1. A serious reason for termination of contrakt...

780
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,650
Stuff like this. This, I spotted one.

781
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,390
It's "contract," not "contrakt."

782
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,340
See what I mean, okay?

783
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm sorry.

784
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,910
Please double-check before submitting.

785
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,990
I'll be watching closely next time.

786
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,620
All right, next.

787
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,550
I'm sorry. Forgive me for being late.

788
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,840
Are you joining us today, Advisor?

789
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,420
I wanted to sit in, too. Am I not allowed?

790
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,450
No, no. We were just getting started.

791
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,230
Oh, okay.

792
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,640
All right. In a contract for buying and selling a pension property,

793
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,950
you wrote that whether the BBQ area remains

794
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,310
is an essential part of the agreement. Right?

795
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,990
Yes. In Korea, a BBQ area is essential

796
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,090
when renting a pension.

797
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,960
So, if the BBQ area is gone,

798
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,990
I thought terminating the contract was valid.

799
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,950
Correct. Applause.

800
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,700
Thank you.

801
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,850
- Or is it?
- Pardon?

802
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:44,990
What do others think?

803
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,010
I thought the contract should still stand.

804
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,240
A pension's primary business is lodging.

805
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,000
So, I viewed everything else as secondary.

806
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,920
I think the ratio of the BBQ area

807
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,580
to the total lot size matters,

808
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,070
but that data wasn't provided.

809
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,550
Area ratio?

810
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,840
That's quite an interesting perspective.

811
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,530
Or it may be completely irrelevant.

812
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,120
What about you, Intern?

813
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,690
I think the key is whether the value

814
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,730
of the BBQ area was factored

815
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,630
into the price at signing.

816
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:24,790
That's good, but no one mentioned the mistake of motive.

817
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,660
I'm sure you all learned it.

818
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,620
Motive?

819
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,210
- Yes, Advisor?
- I learned it.

820
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,410
Wow, you're in big trouble in this case, Interns.

821
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,410
If the Advisor knows this, and she didn't study law,

822
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,270
we've got a problem here. Don't we?

823
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:42,650
By tomorrow, prepare 10 precedent cases on the mistake of motive.

824
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,140
No duplicates, okay?

825
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,050
Okay...

826
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,100
Attorney?

827
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,740
Yes, Advisor? What is it now?

828
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,540
I also went to law school.

829
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,990
Oh, really?

830
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,560
Then, please bring 10 by tomorrow as well, Advisor.

831
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,730
- Pardon?
- By tomorrow.

832
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,610
- But I—
- With no overlap.

833
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,780
- Wait—
- All right, next.

834
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,390
Attorney, I...

835
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,810
Wait, well, gosh...

836
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,910
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

837
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,570
Gosh, he's so intense.

838
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,530
- Goodness. Working hard.
- You keep getting this wrong.

839
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,980
Gosh.

840
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,490
Goodness.

841
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:42,750
Was the Advisor here, too?

842
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,460
Yeah, but she ran away.

843
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,500
- Why?
- Because I gave her homework.

844
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

845
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,040
Enjoy.

846
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,630
I said not to overuse your highlighters.

847
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,030
Did you read this case, too?

848
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,570
Oh, yes. We read it.

849
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,360
But that case was obviously a scam.

850
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,140
Do people really fall for such a scam?

851
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,800
Are they that stupid?

852
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,260
That case felt a bit fishy to me, too. Wasn't it obvious?

853
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,780
Yeah. Getting scammed like that is on them.

854
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,380
Anyone can be tricked.

855
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,190
So... even you interns should be careful.

856
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:30,910
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

857
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,810
Looks good.

858
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,940
What brings you to contact me first?

859
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,640
I'm sorry.

860
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,610
I brought the final revised blueprints, the construction breakdown,

861
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,440
and the contract.

862
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,450
I asked for these a while ago.

863
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,750
How could you bring them now?

864
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,440
I'm sorry. I'm ashamed.

865
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,650
Even if you curse me out, I'll take it.

866
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,770
Even so, how could I curse at you?

867
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,560
I need to add this for the progress payment appraisal.

868
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,630
Am I too late?

869
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,400
The appraisal is already finished.

870
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,850
It's too late to add anything now.

871
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,490
Well...

872
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,730
For this...

873
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:37,060
Every time I think about not getting paid for this, I just burn with anger.

874
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,130
I kept avoiding it because I didn't want to think about it,

875
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,110
and ended up like this.

876
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,070
I'm really sorry.

877
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,810
What else did you need to add?

878
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,540
Oh, that...

879
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,110
The ceiling roof was originally to be a deck plate, but we changed it—

880
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,610
I already included that.

881
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:04,890
You did, Attorney?

882
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,740
Yes. The construction details listed "deck plate,"

883
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,080
but when I looked it up, it looked different from the site.

884
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,460
Here, you can look at this.

885
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,180
So, I added that to the appraisal.

886
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,550
Oh, and the stairs too.

887
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,320
I added those as well.

888
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,240
I noticed there were two types of stair rebar placement drawings.

889
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,750
The latter one had a different rebar count,

890
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,550
so I included that in the appraisal, too.

891
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,520
I don't think I saw the staircase rebar placement drawing.

892
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,620
Here's the rebar placement drawing.

893
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,640
We have records showing we sent it to the defendant.

894
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,070
Thank you, Attorney.

895
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:46,040
Seriously, how did you notice all that just from those documents?

896
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:51,400
That's why I need you to pick up when I call you.

897
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,300
I know it's hard emotionally,

898
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,980
but you need to get your construction payment to feel better.

899
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,600
There's no other way to resolve this. Right?

900
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,470
I'll also do my best to the end.

901
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,660
Yes.

902
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,940
Thank you, Attorney.

903
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,530
Thank you.

904
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,460
Oh, this is nice, too.

905
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,440
Should I get off first?

906
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

907
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,280
Hello.

908
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

909
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,960
Should we put these here?

910
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,360
That looks heavy. Let me take that.

911
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,950
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

912
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,420
What is all this?

913
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,210
Just a small gift for Lunar New Year.

914
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,210
I'll leave them here. Everyone, take one.

915
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

916
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,590
Happy Lunar New Year.

917
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,210
- Happy Lunar New Year.
- Happy Lunar New Year.

918
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,730
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

919
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,510
- So, how is it?
- It's pretty big.

920
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,860
It's pretty amazing.

921
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,660
Wow, is it fruit?

922
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,020
- Open it quickly!
- Maybe it's Korean beef?

923
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,850
What is that?

924
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,820
All right, I will open it.

925
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,920
Gosh, that scared me!

926
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,420
Gosh, you scared me...

927
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,040
Whoa... it's alive.

928
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,710
What did she get scared of?

929
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,800
Was it from seeing this, or from seeing me?

930
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,690
- Advisor, heading home?
- Hello.

931
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,340
Yes.

932
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,410
Why did you bring all this for us?

933
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,020
Oh, it's just a small Lunar New Year's gift.

934
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,820
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

935
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,340
Sure.

936
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:27,270
I'm sorry I haven't been able to refer you many cases.

937
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,210
I should do more

938
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:33,410
to make you feel like I'm part of the firm.

939
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,450
I'm sure you'll take better care of us from now on.

940
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,740
Advisor! Thank you for the gift.

941
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,230
Oh, it's nothing.

942
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,710
Just a small Lunar New Year's gift.

943
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,110
I'll enjoy the lobster!

944
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,970
Yes, happy Lunar New Year.

945
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,630
- Happy Lunar New Year.
- Yes.

946
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,070
Oh, Ms. Kim, thank you for the gift!

947
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:06,240
Can't believe you gave us lobster. Thank you so much!

948
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,930
Yes, Happy Lunar New Year!

949
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,550
- Happy Lunar New Year.
- Yes.

950
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,620
I'll be off now.

951
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,700
Yes. Go ahead.

952
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,620
Happy Lunar New Year.

953
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,700
Yes, you, too.

954
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,440
Please add avocado, too.

955
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,970
I'll take honey oat for the bread.

956
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,550
And please add shrimp and cheese.

957
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,810
American cheese, please.

958
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,280
I'll have 30 cm of the same.

959
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,170
Wow.

960
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,280
Hey, this is good. It's nice.

961
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,130
Hey, are you all going home for the holidays?

962
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,660
- Of course.
- Really?

963
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,300
Hey, you won't get nagged anymore about having a baby now.

964
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,780
I haven't told them yet.

965
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,220
- What?
- Why's that such a secret?

966
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,010
I'll tell them.

967
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,740
I should finally escape the nagging completely.

968
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,000
I already escaped the "When are you getting married" talk.

969
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,940
If I can escape the "When are you having a baby" talk,

970
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,580
it'll be the end of all nagging.

971
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,910
So, do your families all ask why you're not getting married?

972
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,210
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

973
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,860
- You've never heard that?
- I haven't.

974
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,390
Hey, you may be the youngest here,

975
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,650
but you're getting to the age you'll start hearing it.

976
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,130
My parents don't nag me about stuff like that.

977
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,210
For my family, my dad is always the one.

978
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,300
Same.

979
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,020
When my mom starts, my dad always gives a final word.

980
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,550
Me, too. Wow, we're exactly the same.

981
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,570
I'm jealous. I don't have a dad.

982
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,300
Geez...

983
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,290
Don't joke about stuff like that.

984
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,780
- Ha Sang Ki, seriously, don't do that.
- Ow, that hurts.

985
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,450
Father!

986
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,420
What are you, a kid?

987
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,330
Hey, it's freezing!

988
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,580
Gosh, it's cold.

989
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,580
I guess we'll see each other after the holidays.

990
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,800
- Get some good rest, everyone.
- Yeah.

991
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,850
Don't cry, missing me.

992
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,430
- Hurry up and go.
- I'm off.

993
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,690
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

994
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,870
Gosh, it's cold.

995
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,210
What? What is it?

996
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,940
It's nothing.

997
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,790
Lobster!

998
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,950
- What's with you?
- Lobster.

999
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,370
My Ji Seok loves it.

1000
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,530
Don't you have any thoughts about marriage?

1001
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:56,760
Why are you so shocked?

1002
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,060
What's with you? Mom, you're not like this.

1003
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,020
I can't even ask you that?

1004
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,310
Dad.

1005
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,800
Don't you want to get married?

1006
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,650
Dad!

1007
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,610
Mom, when is Jung Ki coming?

1008
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,360
He said he's coming tomorrow.

1009
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,000
- Where are you going, Mom?
- I have to go to work.

1010
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,400
- But it's the Lunar New Year.
- We're busier on Lunar New Year's.

1011
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,410
Make sure to put that in the fridge.

1012
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:43,060
- Okay.
- I'm heading out.

1013
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,900
Gosh, this is such great news!

1014
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,890
I did well, right?

1015
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,190
Will you have a second child right away?

1016
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,870
What? This is my first. Why talk about a second child?

1017
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:11,720
Think of your age. Why wouldn't we talk about a second child?

1018
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,880
Dad.

1019
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,960
How will you work after the baby comes?

1020
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,790
Can you take maternity leave or parental leave?

1021
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,320
Come on. She's an attorney. Why worry about that?

1022
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,390
Gosh. All of you, be quiet!

1023
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:25,580
I'll handle it myself.

1024
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:29,860
Uncle, buy us ice cream!

1025
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,740
- Please buy us some.
- Hey!

1026
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,130
Uncle! Uncle! Buy us ice cream!

1027
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,660
Okay, Uncle will buy you ice cream.

1028
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,600
Go andsit over there. I'll buy it for you soon.

1029
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,410
Hey, Chang Won.

1030
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,600
Yes?

1031
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,680
I'll call you later.

1032
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,420
Read this over

1033
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,980
and try to argue my case as if you're my attorney.

1034
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,620
- Argue your case?
- Pretend you're in court and give it a shot.

1035
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,770
- Right now?
- Yeah, now.

1036
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,510
Do I have to pay you a retainer fee?

1037
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,610
No, it's not like that, but...

1038
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:10,220
Come on, you do this all the time. It should be easy for you.

1039
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,420
Aigoo, it looks delicious.

1040
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,800
- Looks so good.
- Looks delicious.

1041
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,910
What time should we go to your aunt's house tomorrow?

1042
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:33,930
I think I need to go into the firm tomorrow.

1043
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,750
Are you that busy?

1044
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,320
Well, I just have a bunch of little things to take care of.

1045
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,380
Yes.

1046
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,230
What are you doing here?

1047
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,920
I thought you'd be spending the entire break with your parents.

1048
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,440
There's not much more to do at home.

1049
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,380
I guess I've become a full-fledged attorney.

1050
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:01,070
I feel most at ease being at the office.

1051
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,300
What about you?

1052
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,710
I've been a full-fledged attorney for a while now.

1053
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:21,010
Do you... want to go eat?

1054
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,700
Sounds good.

1055
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,640
This way?

1056
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,380
Here?

1057
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,940
But don't you smell something savory in the air?

1058
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,650
I was frying pancakes all day.

1059
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,420
Doesn't your family make pancakes?

1060
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,230
We make dumplings.

1061
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,070
Dumplings.

1062
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:43,320
Don't I smell like dumplings?

1063
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,200
Dumplings? Dumplings don't leave a smell.

1064
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,920
Dumplings do leave a smell, like a stew.

1065
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,690
Oh, did you have dumpling stew?

1066
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,060
We had dumpling stew, and...

1067
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,190
Wow, can't believe it's empty here.

1068
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:04,100
Yeah, nothing's open.

1069
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,130
Maybe there's something near Gangnam Station.

1070
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:09,790
Wow, Gangnam Station.

1071
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:13,970
I know a 24-hour place there.

1072
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,930
The day you stood me up,

1073
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:19,080
I went there alone to eat because it was so cold.

1074
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,480
That place is still open.

1075
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,190
Every time I walk by it, I still get mad.

1076
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,250
That's why I couldn't find you.

1077
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,920
Pardon?

1078
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,690
Well...

1079
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,570
I went to Gangnam Station, too.

1080
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:37,640
Liar.

1081
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,690
Do you think I'm you? Why would I lie?

1082
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,250
Why are you telling me this now?

1083
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:46,450
Well, I missed the timing to say it.

1084
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,100
It's still unbelievable.

1085
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,300
How could you think that I was canceling?

1086
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,310
We definitely promised to see each other again,

1087
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:01,790
but you asked again if we'd see each other again.

1088
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:05,300
For me, that was basically a confession.

1089
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,130
We were about to part ways,

1090
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:09,560
but even though you said we should meet in Seoul,

1091
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,230
you never asked me to date you.

1092
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,350
Next time, tell me clearly so I understand.

1093
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,720
Next time when?

1094
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,950
Right now?

1095
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,390
Is this clear enough for you?

1096
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,360
Do you take me for a fool?

1097
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,200
♫  You stood out, shining so brightly  ♫

1098
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,380
♫  What began as coincidence  ♫

1099
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:27,430
♫  I hope we are meant to be wrapped in fate  ♫

1100
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:37,620

1101

♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

1102
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:52,700
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

1103
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,600
So what do you want to eat?

1104
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:00,830
An açaí bowl.

1105
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,010
An açaí bowl?

1106
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,140
What the...

1107
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,770
What's this?

1108
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,170
What brings you here?

1109
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,910
What is this? Did you guys make plans without me?

1110
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,350
Don't be ridiculous.

1111
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:16,840
Why are you here? What about your husband?

1112
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,350
He's sleeping at home.

1113
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,690
Wait, wait, wait.

1114
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,880
So, did we run into each other by coincidence?

1115
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,760
Why is he acting all excited?

1116
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,680
It's exciting! It feels like fate!

1117
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,090
It's nice, and it's snowing!

1118
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,650
I can't believe nothing is open.

1119
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,990
I thought you said it was open 24 hours.

1120
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:39,840
- I didn't say 365 days a year.
- Geez.

1121
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:46,830
Hey.

1122
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,290
What are you all doing here?

1123
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,470
What's this?

1124
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,760
What... What's with you two?

1125
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,320
Did you two make plans separately?

1126
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,340
N-No. I came here first,

1127
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,400
and Ju Hyeong was at the office, too.

1128
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,650
No, I was coming to the office,

1129
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,830
and she was standing out in front.

1130
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:04,230
- What are you saying?
- Suspicious.

1131
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,560
Hey, forget it. Let's just eat.

1132
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,420
- I'll have this one.
- Yeah.

1133
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,770
I thought two pizzas would be too much, but it worked out. Let's eat.

1134
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,150
Hey. Aren't you curious why we're here?

1135
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:15,630
Isn't it obvious?

1136
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,590
Hey, I forgot to take a photo. Wait.

1137
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:20,220
I took one. I'll send it to you later.

1138
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:22,600
But I have my own vibe.

1139
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,220
I took a good one.

1140
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,380
Thanks.

1141
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,940
It feels nice to be back in the lounge.

1142
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,710
Yeah.

1143
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:41,250
I feel most comfortable here.

1144
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,150
The snow is really coming down.

1145
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,840
Yeah, Mom.

1146
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,950
What?

What do you mean you don't have it?

1153
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,710
You got what I sent through President Park!

1154
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,010
No way...

1155
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:53,700
Your father was in a holding cell.

1156
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,650
Are you okay? You're going through a big ordeal.

1157
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,430
You're not thinking of representing me, are you?

1158
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:00,950
Dad!

1159
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:04,290
Don't come anymore, okay?

1160
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,410
Wait, do you believe this contract is real?

1161
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,900
This is Hui Ji's dad.

1162
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,050
Aren't you treating him too much like any client?

1163
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,690
This is an attorney visit.

1164
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:18,420
Please tell him to come out. Please.
