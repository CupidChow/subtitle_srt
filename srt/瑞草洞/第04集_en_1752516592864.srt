CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,210
Who's representing the plaintiff?

4
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,380
I'm Ahn Juhyeong

5
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,460
with Law Group Hyungmin,
attorney for plaintiff Cha Jeongho.

6
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,380
Who's representing the defendant?

7
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,050
Are you the party in question?

8
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,140
Yes.

9
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,810
I'm…

10
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,730
Park Sujeong.

11
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,980
Okay, please take a seat.

12
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,110
The plaintiff is filing only for divorce,

13
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,790
and the defendant is countersuing
for alimony and asset division.

14
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,910
You do agree to the divorce, correct?

15
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,580
Yes.

16
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,630
Defendant,

17
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,470
there's no specific reason
or basis provided for the countersuit,

18
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,640
so the plaintiff has nothing
to respond to right now.

19
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,810
Please have that part prepared
by the next court date.

20
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,480
And the plaintiff
will respond accordingly.

21
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,270
Yes, Your Honor.

22
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
Defendant,

23
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,900
you can't be crying already.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,490
This is just the first trial.

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,990
Then, we'll continue this trial later.

26
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,450
The next court date
will be on the 19th of December…

28
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,500
Hey.

29
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,420
Do you know why this dish
is called <i>jjimdak</i> and not <i>dakjjim?</i>

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,340
Why?

31
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,220
I don't know. I was asking you.

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,340
I mean, it's different

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,100
- from <i>galbijjim </i>and <i>agujjim</i>.
- Idiot.

34
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,890
Hey, did you change your phone case?

35
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,190
Of course, you'd pick that one.

36
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,230
Where did you get it?
My grandfather would love one too.

37
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,360
You punk.

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,990
Hey, this thing's great.
It can hold everything.

39
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,650
Are you going to cut this forever?

40
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm chopping it up,
so we can eat it with a spoon.

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,530
Yeah, chop it up into bits
so it's easier for Grandpa Sanggi to eat.

42
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,240
That's enough nonsense, you brat!

43
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,460
Attorney Ha?

44
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,710
Hello, Director!

45
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,290
I had some business nearby
and just grabbed a bite here.

46
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,050
- I see!
- Enjoy your meal.

47
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,760
Have a good day, Attorney Ha.

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,880
I'll be in touch. All right.

49
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,100
Gosh, what a warm smile.
How about doing that for me too?

50
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,390
I am doing it, you punk.

51
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,680
What more do you want?

52
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,100
It's all ready now.

53
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,190
Let's eat.

54
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,690
Okay.

55
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,570
- You saw me earlier, right?
- I didn't.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,450
I didn't say where though.

57
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,500
I'm sure it was family court.
It's the only place I went to today.

58
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,040
Gosh, you're so confident.
You really didn't see me?

59
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,800
What's with you?

60
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,760
Sorry about that. Excuse us.

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,930
Damn it. Is it because it's winter again?

62
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,060
Your snot's hanging out. It's gross.

63
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,850
Hey, we're eating here. That's nasty.

64
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,390
- This cut-up stuff better be good.
- Try it.

65
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,810
- So delicious.
- You little…

66
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,360
Want some? The cucumbers too?

67
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,150
That was good.

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,070
- Which cafe should we go to?
- I'm going to visit the clinic.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,870
- Okay, bye.
- All right, later.

70
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,830
- So which cafe?
- I'm busy too, so I'm off.

71
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,290
You too?

72
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,670
Hey, where should we go?

73
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,250
I was thinking of this spot.

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,550
Huiji. You're coming, right?

75
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,380
What? I'm busy too. Bye.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
What?

77
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,300
It's just the two of us.

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,770
This wasn't expected.

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,430
Let's go to that spot.

81
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,000
DIVORCE

82
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,050
PLAINTIFF CHA JEONGHO
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

83
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,290
Hello, Attorney Ahn.

84
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,910
Hello. We had the divorce trial
this morning.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,210
How did it go?

86
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,040
<i>There wasn't much progress.</i>

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,000
<i>The judge told the defendant</i>
<i>to provide a specific reason or basis,</i>

88
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,550
<i>so they'll probably submit that</i>
<i>by the next trial.</i>

89
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,380
She didn't write anything down,

90
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,010
because there's no reason
to ask for alimony.

91
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,060
She didn't say anything weird, right?

92
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,930
No, nothing out of the ordinary.

93
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,480
<i>I guess we'll just wait then</i>
<i>and see what she submits.</i>

94
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,940
Good work.

95
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,780
Thank you. Goodbye.

96
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,730
You saw me earlier, right?

97
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,230
I didn't.

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,200
He's impossible to figure out.

99
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,130
Since when do you drink hot coffee?

100
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,670
I lowered my standards for you.

101
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,970
Sitting here like this

102
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,100
makes it seem like
we're the only ones with nothing to do.

103
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,350
They're just acting super busy.

104
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,350
We're on the same page for once.

105
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,350
I dumbed down
the conversation quality for you.

106
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,650
Thank you very much.

107
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,040
I recently saw my father
since he was in the area.

108
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Right.

109
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,330
He started going on
about Hanguk Group again.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,380
Seriously, I'm so sick of it.

111
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,550
Is he still pushing you
to be their in-house counsel?

112
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,930
Actually, he didn't bring it up this time.

113
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,010
That's good progress.

114
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,640
- Hey.
- What?

115
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,890
What does your father do?

116
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,810
- My father? Why?
- What do you mean "Why?"

117
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,560
You know about my father,
but I don't know about yours.

118
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,310
Then, you can continue to not know.

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,900
Come on. What does he do?

120
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Hey!

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,070
What does your father do?

122
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,650
He's taking it easy. He's retired.

123
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Really?

124
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,530
Tell him to get some rest.

125
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,920
- You always turn up at this time of year.
- I know, right?

126
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,180
They're typical seasonal allergies,
so I'll prescribe your usual meds.

127
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,140
- The meds last time were fine, right?
- Yes, they helped.

128
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,890
I'll prescribe the same ones then.

129
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,640
You're not pregnant or anything, right?

130
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,310
No, I'm not.

131
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Here you go.

132
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,440
Okay, wait just a moment.

133
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,530
Okay.

134
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,760
SELF-SERVICE MOTEL

135
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,870
The marriage certificate

136
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,080
- should be under that.
- I see.

137
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,080
DEATH CERTIFICATE
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

138
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,670
It seems the victim passed
about nine months ago.

139
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,300
Was that on the same day as the accident?

140
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,470
Yes, they said she died instantly.

141
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,840
- And the perpetrator?
- Song?

142
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,930
Yes.

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,350
He died the next day.

144
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,270
How did you learn
that the perpetrator was drunk driving?

145
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,730
The police told me.

146
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,690
He was drunk enough to lose his license.

147
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,650
- I see.
- It's weird, isn't it?

148
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,490
The driver was wasted and crashed the car,

149
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,410
but while the passenger died instantly,

150
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,950
he stuck around one more day.

151
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,960
Yes. By the way…

152
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,880
Did the victim have alcohol
in her system as well?

153
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,590
Yes, it was at a similar level.

154
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,630
Now that hear it, it's pretty ridiculous.

155
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
What do you mean?

156
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,180
They were both drunk.
One drove and one was a passenger.

157
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,600
They were both in the wrong.

158
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,770
But since he drove, he's the perpetrator.

159
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,980
And she died as a passenger,

160
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,320
so she's the victim.

161
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,030
I mean, thanks to that,

162
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,950
I can file for damages against him.

163
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,700
Yes, I guess you could see it that way.

164
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,790
How do I file for damages?

165
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,870
Right.

166
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,330
If you decide to file for damages,

167
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,920
you can demand compensation

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,050
from Song Yeongcheol
for your wife's death.

169
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,590
But he's dead.

170
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,340
Yes, that's right.

171
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,010
So we would file the claim
against his family,

172
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,430
who are his legal heirs.

173
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,720
I see.

174
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,520
So it's the people left behind
suing each other.

175
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Yes.

176
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,110
Also, as you mentioned,

177
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,030
your wife was responsible
for enabling the drunk driving,

178
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,490
so compensation will be reduced
because of that.

179
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,410
Don't say she's my wife.
Just call her the victim.

180
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
No.

181
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,540
I'm the victim here.

182
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,370
Sir?

183
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,710
Do you know where the crash happened?

184
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,380
Right outside a motel strip.

185
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,880
They were in such a hurry

186
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,890
that they didn't slow down
after getting there.

187
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Right, so…

188
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,230
There are two claims
you can file for compensation.

189
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,320
One for the affair
and one for your wife's death.

190
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,360
Is there anything you know
about the perpetrators' family?

191
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,700
Like who his legal heir is?

192
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,280
He has a wife, a daughter, and a son.

193
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,620
That bastard had kids.

194
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,170
Then, we'll proceed by naming his wife
and children as defendants.

195
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,620
in the lawsuit.

196
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,420
I heard both his kids
aren't even 10 years old yet.

197
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,670
Should we leave them out?

198
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,850
Let's include them.

199
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,020
If you only file against his wife,

200
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,150
your claim is limited
three-sevenths of the full amount.

201
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,860
And as I mentioned before,

202
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,230
if we consider the reduction
from the victim's aiding of drunk driving,

203
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,360
you'll be looking at even less.

204
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,410
Without the kids, the amount is too low.

205
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,740
Okay, let's do that.

206
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,700
Please file it right away.

207
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,950
I will, sir.

208
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,520
PREGNANCY TEST

209
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,860
Why is everyone so down?

210
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,200
Why?

211
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,910
What should we do?
Want to get drunk after work?

212
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,910
- No.
- No.

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,540
Yeah, I didn't want to either.

214
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,550
I'm a little tired.
Who even drinks these days?

215
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,880
I told you to stay quiet.

216
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,050
When?

217
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,130
I just did.

218
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
What?

219
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,430
- Hello.
- Hello.

220
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,850
- We meet again.
- Yes.

221
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,150
Don't mind me.
Please relax and eat.

222
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,870
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

223
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,330
Wait. You two are close now?

224
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,040
We ran into each other a few times.

225
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,170
Look at you.
You're such a social butterfly.

226
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm getting competitive.

227
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,210
Step it up, Changwon!
I need to work harder.

228
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,180
Did you call me, sir?

229
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,180
This is the lawyer I mentioned.

230
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,350
Of all the attorneys at our firm,
he's the perfect fit.

231
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,810
- You know, we occupy this whole building.
- Right.

232
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,730
Say hello to Chairman Jang Gwanggi.

233
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,400
Hello, I'm Cho Changwon.

234
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,320
Yes, nice to meet you.

235
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,490
You're pretty handsome.

236
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,530
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,620
He's got a real knack for conversation.

238
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,250
Your son won't be bored at all.

239
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,750
So…

240
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,380
I have a favor to ask.

241
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,840
I have a son

242
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,840
that I can't just ignore.

243
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,430
He keeps complaining

244
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,350
about how tough life is
in the detention center.

245
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,810
Just until his trial's done,

246
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,890
can you keep him company?

247
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,650
Yes, sir.

248
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,110
It's nothing big. It's just a quick visit
for an hour each day.

249
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,450
The chairman's son
has been wrongly accused,

250
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,030
so he's currently in custody.

251
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,830
But life in detention is tough. Poor kid.

252
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,370
So are you saying
we're taking on his case?

253
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
No.

254
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,220
That's being handled by another firm,
so don't worry about it.

255
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Just go and talk about what's going on
in the world for an hour.

256
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,980
Okay.

257
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,610
WRITTEN STATEMENT

258
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,980
PLAINTIFF CHA JEONGHO
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

259
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,490
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

260
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,290
I'm coming in.

261
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,790
Hey.

262
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,920
You said you'd trade your divorce case
for my sale proceeds case.

263
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
- What happened?
- Oh, that.

264
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,630
I talked with Mr. Na,
but I decided to just keep it.

265
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,220
What the hell?
You got my hopes up for nothing.

266
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,180
That sales proceeds case is so difficult.

267
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,640
If you're stuck, bring it over.
I'll help you.

268
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,600
Why did you want to switch at first?

269
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,400
- You said I'd find out once I started.
- It's nothing.

270
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,070
What? Fine.

271
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,030
I'll need your help later. See you.

272
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,960
You're a little late.

273
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,130
Yes, I was stuck in traffic.

274
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,350
Did she submit this?

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,190
Yes. It's a written statement
submitted by Park Sujeong.

276
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,230
She wrote down a lot.

277
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,110
What does it say?

278
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,870
It says you were physically
and verbally abusive during the marriage.

279
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,620
DEFENDANT WAS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED

280
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,210
DEFENDANT WAS VERBALLY ABUSED

281
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,510
This is it? Where's the evidence?

282
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,630
She didn't submit any evidence.

283
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,220
There's no actual evidence then?

284
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,400
Did you assault her?

285
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,530
Does it matter? There's no evidence.

286
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,200
If it's true, now is the time to speak up.

287
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,700
That way, I can respond properly.

288
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,370
It's not true.

289
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,920
Even according to her,
it was just one time, not multiple.

290
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,330
So not even once?

291
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,380
No.

292
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,050
Not by my standards.

293
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,890
- What about verbal abuse?
- I didn't do that either.

294
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,020
Not by my standards.

295
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
All right.

296
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,160
I'll submit a written statement
firmly denying everything on that premise.

297
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,250
What? You don't believe me?

298
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,120
Whether I believe you or not
isn't that important.

299
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,170
How is that not important?

300
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,510
How can I let someone represent me
if they don't believe me?

301
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,850
My job is to help you properly exercise
your right to defend yourself.

302
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,520
What I believe
doesn't change how I do my job.

303
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,150
So don't worry about that.

304
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,720
Since the plaintiff's wife
died instantly in the accident,

305
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,760
there's no basis for a claim
against the defendant's husband.

306
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,770
A deceased person
can't be granted any legal rights.

307
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,900
The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled

308
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,400
that even in cases of instant death,
the right to claim damages

309
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,490
is still recognized in that brief moment.

310
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,530
Kim Minkyung knew
Mr. Song was drunk driving

311
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,450
but turned a blind eye to it,

312
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,200
so that fault reduces the payout.

313
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,990
That said,
the plaintiff's claim for damages

314
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,910
has nothing to do with drunk driving.

315
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,420
The claim also includes
compensation for the affair,

316
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,050
so that needs to be assessed separately.

317
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,340
Okay, all of that
is already in the written submission,

318
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,550
so let's leave it there.

319
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,680
The defendants haven't renounced
their inheritance, correct?

320
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,770
No, Your Honor. The house and other assets
are under Mr. Song's name,

321
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,110
so the defendants couldn't renounce it
based on their living conditions.

322
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,320
In this case, neither the plaintiff
nor the defendants

323
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,820
are the real parties here.

324
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,780
If anything,
they're all just victims of the affair.

325
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Let's do this.

326
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,460
We'll schedule a preparatory hearing,

327
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,460
and I'll try to mediate directly then,

328
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,470
so make sure both the plaintiff
and the defendants attend.

329
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,800
But we'll exclude the defendants
who are minors.

330
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,350
Just have Lee Sujin attend.

331
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,850
Yes, Your Honor.
I'll talk to the plaintiff.

332
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,070
We've actually discussed this before,
but I'm not sure if she will come.

333
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,320
Well then,

334
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,690
please do your best to persuade her.

335
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,200
Yes, Your Honor.

336
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,070
The same goes for plaintiff's counsel.

337
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,370
Yes, Your Honor. I will.

338
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,330
Let's go home.

339
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,090
And I got everything.

340
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,390
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

341
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
PRESIDENT KIM

342
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,730
Hello?

343
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,150
Me? I'm clocking out.

344
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,280
Yeah.

345
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,800
Dad, what brings you here?

346
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,630
I just happened
to be passing by your office.

347
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,350
And you weren't circling the block
for the tenth time?

348
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,220
Hey, your dad's not that sweet, okay?

349
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,440
Put your seat belt on.

350
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,450
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

351
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,510
Aren't you exhausted
from working late every day?

352
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,720
You've been so busy
since you became a lawyer.

353
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,680
No, I'm okay.

354
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,390
I enjoy the work.

355
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,060
I have to put in the hours now
to learn fast.

356
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,940
Hey, it's not like
we live far away or anything.

357
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,190
We're a stone's throw away,
so visit more often.

358
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,230
Your mom misses you.

359
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,240
If she misses me, she should just call.

360
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,700
You know your mom's the shy type.

361
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,830
Since when?

362
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,370
She figures you're busy. That's why.

363
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,750
I know.

364
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,210
I liked it more
when you played piano.

365
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,380
You came home more often
and didn't work this late.

366
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,970
Don't most parents prefer
their kids to be lawyers?

367
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,430
If this is what you want,
that's all that matters to us.

368
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Then, we're good.

369
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,320
But are you sure
this is what you wanted to do?

370
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,780
I've wondered if you suddenly
went into law because of me.

371
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,240
It's been weighing on me.

372
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,450
You're so full of yourself.

373
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,670
I'm not that sweet, you know.

374
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,630
Then, we're good.

375
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,710
Are you coming for memorial rites?

376
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,300
It's already been 25 years
since your parents passed.

377
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,930
Yeah, I'll be there.

378
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,740
- Thanks.
- Sure.

379
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,790
Go on and get some rest.

380
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,540
Okay. Drive safe, Dad.

381
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,520
Anyone here
for the 10:00 a.m. case?

382
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,320
Cha Jeongho and Park Sujeong?
Okay, please come in.

383
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,470
CASE NUMBER 2024-154671
CHA, PARK

384
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,690
Defendant, your claims are well-organized,

385
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,650
but you haven't submitted any evidence.

386
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,910
Do you have anything
to support the allegations of abuse?

387
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,080
Maybe photos of injuries

388
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,330
or an audio recording of the verbal abuse?

389
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,380
- Please submit them if you have any.
- Do I…

390
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,500
have to submit those?

391
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,840
If you don't submit anything,
there won't be any evidence.

392
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,430
We can't accept your claims then.

393
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,640
Defendant, do you have
any evidence to submit?

394
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,690
No, I don't.

395
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,570
The plaintiff has submitted

396
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,370
a written statement
strongly denying the abuse claims.

397
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,160
You've received that, correct?

398
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,210
- Yes.
- But you're saying you have no evidence.

399
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Is that correct?

400
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Yes.

401
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
Your Honor.

402
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,680
As we've already stated
in our previous brief,

403
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,680
there was no physical or verbal abuse.

404
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,480
The defendant has nothing more,

405
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,440
so we ask you end proceedings
and move to judgment.

406
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,230
We can't end proceedings
at this stage just yet.

407
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,780
It seems the evidence review
for damages is almost done.

408
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,450
Let's try another round of mediation.

409
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,830
If it doesn't work this time,
we'll resume proceedings…

410
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,750
MENSTRUAL CYCLE

411
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Hey, Munjeong.

412
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,300
Hey.

413
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,520
- Where are the others?
- Their trials have them a ways off.

414
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,230
Even Juhyeong?

415
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,190
I saw him at family court this morning.

416
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,310
You saw him earlier?

417
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,940
Yeah, just from behind.

418
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,480
Really?
He said he won't be able to grab lunch.

419
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,030
I guess Juhyeong
takes on his friends' cases too.

420
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
When I saw him, it seemed like
he knew his client pretty well.

421
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,660
I doubt it.

422
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,330
That's actually
the one type of case he won't do.

423
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,500
Really?

424
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,590
Why do you look so down?

425
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,050
Should we get dessert after?

426
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,100
Why? I'm fine.

427
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,350
Do I look tired?

428
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,480
Dessert sounds good though.

429
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,810
- What do you want to eat?
- Pasta and…

430
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,190
FIND MY CASE

431
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,320
PARK SUJEONG

432
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,870
DIVORCE
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

433
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,200
I was right.

434
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,620
TRIAL DATE
MEDIATION DATE

435
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,120
A mediation date has been set.

436
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,300
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

437
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,760
ATTORNEY IN CHARGE
AHN JUHYEONG

438
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,130
"Plaintiff's counsel"?

439
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,090
Not Park Sujeong's counsel?

440
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,130
- Hi.
- Hello.

441
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,380
You look miserable this morning.

442
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,720
I guess I knew
someone would pick a fight this early.

443
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,120
I saw you were handling
Park Sujeong's divorce case.

444
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,290
Are you okay?

445
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,010
What are you so surprised about?

446
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,260
We ran into each other that day

447
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,760
when you walked by
and pretended not to know me.

448
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,390
How did you know she was Sujeong?

449
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,100
Well, I just happened to by chance.

450
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,480
Why would you take that case?
Just because you were told to?

451
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,400
It's just work. Same as any other case.
I do what they give me.

452
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,740
How is that the same?

453
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,530
I thought you were representing her
for old times' sake.

454
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,660
What's so different about it?

455
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,870
Just because you act like an amateur
doesn't mean everyone else does.

456
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,380
What you're doing

457
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,340
isn't being professional.

458
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,800
It's being stupid.

459
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,380
Then, I should've whined and said,

460
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,470
"I can't take the case
because she's my ex"?

461
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,970
Yes, you should have.

462
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,720
But you don't even know to say that,
so it's stupid.

463
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,230
You can say those things all you want.

464
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,020
But I've never worked like that.

465
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,820
Do the others know?

466
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,370
No, I didn't tell anyone.

467
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,550
INVALIDITY OF DEFENDANT'S ABUSE CLAIMS

468
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
WRITTEN STATEMENT

469
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,370
It's so good.

470
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,870
Here.

471
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,790
- We should've went to eat pork cutlets.
- Why? This is good.

472
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,750
This is going to make your sweater smell.

473
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,960
Yeah, that is true.

474
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,430
Is it good?

475
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,160
- I have to go in here.
- Okay.

476
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,990
I'll be right back.

477
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Okay, I'll be right here.

478
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,330
Don't come in. It'll be embarrassing.

479
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,920
Okay. You're going to be late. Go on in.

480
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,880
I'll be right back.

481
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,800
- I'll be quick.
- Okay, already.

482
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,890
Just have a seat.

483
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,550
How have you been?

484
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,220
Let's avoid any personal talk.

485
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,020
Did you have to stay on this case?

486
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,070
You should've hired a lawyer too.

487
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,110
Why keep showing up in person?

488
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,530
Let's just talk about the case.

489
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,990
Right now, I'm not Ahn Juhyeong.
I'm just Cha Jeongho's attorney.

490
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,380
You should drop the case.

491
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,010
Just hand it off
to another lawyer at your firm.

492
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,310
Why should I let you

493
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,640
find out that my marriage is a mess?

494
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,270
Why should I?

495
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,740
Sujeong,

496
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,700
do everything you can.

497
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,200
Submit all the evidence you have.

498
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,260
I don't have any.

499
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,360
Then, let's end this today.

500
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,990
If you drop all your claims,
we can wrap things up right now.

501
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,420
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

502
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,580
- Hello.
- How can I help you?

503
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,750
I'm here for a visit.

504
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,220
Okay, you've been confirmed.

505
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Thank you.

506
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,650
Hello. I'm here for a visit.

507
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,160
One moment, please.

508
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,620
Okay. Here you go.

509
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,500
Sir,

510
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,120
you can head to Room 5.

511
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,680
ROOM 5

512
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,010
Hello, Mr. Jang Sugil.

513
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,270
I'm Attorney Cho Changwon.

514
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,150
Right. Damn it. I wanted them
to send a girl, not some guy.

515
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,270
You seem pretty disappointed.

516
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,820
But I'm considered
the prettiest one at our firm.

517
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,870
Yeah, I doubt that.

518
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,040
Well, you can come out
and see for yourself.

519
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,000
So what should we talk about?

520
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,000
Talk about what? Goddamn it.

521
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,090
I just wanted a female lawyer
to shoot the breeze with. Not a guy…

522
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,720
Seriously…

523
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,100
Fill me in on yesterday's
Champions League game then.

524
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,890
- Who won?
- The Champions League?

525
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,060
I don't watch soccer.

526
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,690
Unbelievable.

527
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,320
What kind of idiot did they send?

528
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,150
Then, how about this?

529
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,360
You were arrested for stock manipulation.
Let's talk about the case.

530
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,820
I'll talk about the case

531
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,780
with my lawyer
who's actually representing me.

532
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,120
You're not here to represent me.

533
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,210
You think you're here as a lawyer?

534
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,500
You're a loser keeping me company.

535
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,510
When does this end?

536
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,650
- Where are you coming back from?
- I had a trial. You too?

537
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,490
No, I…

538
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
had a prison visit.

539
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
I see.

540
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,750
What is it?

541
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,170
What?

542
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,340
It's just I've never seen you
with such a serious expression before.

543
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,010
Really?

544
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,350
Or are you not upset
and just out of energy?

545
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,430
What, is something wrong?

546
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
No.

547
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,350
I'm just bored
because nothing's going on at all.

548
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,940
Man, I wish I could take on
an exciting case for once.

549
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,650
Something that feels
worth doing.

550
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,990
What kind of case
was that prison visit for?

551
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,070
Oh, that.

552
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,780
Some stock manipulation.

553
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,620
There must be a lot of victims then.

554
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,160
The problem is,
no one knows if there's a lot or not.

555
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,130
You didn't get the records yet?

556
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,590
Yeah, I got them. Of course, I did.

557
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,510
But why do I feel so gloomy?

558
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,340
Everyone's been so down.
Maybe I caught it too.

559
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,890
Yeah, everyone's been looking down lately.

560
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,560
- Just in case…
- Yes?

561
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,270
If they ask something
that's difficult to answer, I'll help out.

562
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,690
So don't worry too much.

563
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,860
Okay, thank you.

564
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,780
All rise.

565
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,590
Please be seated.

566
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,840
I know this must be a difficult case
for you to attend in person today,

567
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,930
so I'd like to thank both parties
for making the time to be here.

568
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,890
Given the nature of this case,

569
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,150
both sides were, in a way,
victims of the affair.

570
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,730
So we felt it was best to help you
reach an agreement peacefully

571
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,400
without causing further harm.

572
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,360
That's why we called you here today.

573
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,870
We know this is painful,

574
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,290
and we hope you understand
the court deeply regrets

575
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,330
having you to appear in person as well.

576
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,420
Let's try to wrap this up
through mediation today.

577
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,260
Yes, I'll do that.

578
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,640
Did you really regret it?

579
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,650
Do you really understand how painful

580
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
this is for us?

581
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,150
We sincerely hope this can be resolved,

582
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,700
so both of you can move on
and start anew--

583
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,120
Move on?

584
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,210
Peacefully without causing further harm?

585
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,130
You think that's possible?

586
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,550
Do you think settling with him

587
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,010
will fix everything?

588
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,050
Geez.

589
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,600
If I had just

590
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,720
given up my inheritance,

591
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,850
I wouldn't have had to go through
the ordeal of paying damages

592
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,110
to my husband's mistress.

593
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,530
But I have two kids to feed.

594
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,740
And we need that house
under Song Yeongcheol's name to survive.

595
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
I was…

596
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,330
so pathetic
that I couldn't give up my inheritance.

597
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,590
You have no idea how it feels
to suffer this humiliation.

598
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,430
That's why instead of leaving it
to the court,

599
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,350
we brought both parties here
to settle it themselves.

600
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,850
So please try to stay calm.

601
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,390
Are you saying

602
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,900
if I handle things myself and settle,
I'll get a fresh start?

603
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,440
Do you think he feels at peace right now?

604
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,660
I mean,

605
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,580
if this were something I did,

606
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,460
I'd take full responsibility.

607
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:14,010
But I didn't do any of this!

608
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,640
There's no way

609
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,270
that I can personally

610
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,570
hand over the money
to my husband's mistress.

611
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,610
So please, just give a verdict.

612
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,030
Just take it from me by force.

613
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:40,200
I absolutely cannot bring myself
to personally pay them.

614
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,680
This is driving me crazy.

615
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,980
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

616
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,910
This will confirm
that the divorce finalized

617
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,990
and there are no remaining claims

618
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,330
for anything owed,
such as alimony or asset division.

620
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,530
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

621
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,950
So in this case,
there likely will be one more trial date.

622
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,830
If things wrap up then,
they'll set the date for the verdict.

623
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,160
Yes, I understand.

624
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,210
Excuse me. Thank you for your time.

625
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,800
Does someone like you

626
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,050
even understand how someone like me feels?

627
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,020
Let's go now.

628
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,480
People like you
are born into nice families

629
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,730
and go to expensive law schools,

630
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,520
where it's easier
to become a lawyer.

631
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,400
How could you even relate
to something like this?

632
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,950
You named my kids as defendants!

633
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,120
You shouldn't live your life like that.

634
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:45,990
Let's go.

635
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,000
I looked you up to see
what kind of person you were.

636
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,210
You're not the only one
who looked into things!

637
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,220
- Attorney Ha.
- Yes?

638
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,050
- Let's just go.
- Yes, let's go.

639
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,410
The case ended in your favor,
so you won't need to come in anymore.

640
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,210
How could I not show up
after hearing such good news?

641
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,390
It's nothing much.
Just a gift certificate.

642
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,270
I wanted to show my thanks.

643
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,690
- So please take it.
- No, it's okay.

644
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,980
Come on.

645
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,650
Take it!

646
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,320
You pulled off a clean win.

647
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,280
Yes, thank you.

648
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,380
I'm so glad I had you take the case.

649
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,840
I made

650
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,760
a specific request
when I talked to Mr. Na.

651
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,810
I asked for you
to be put on my case.

652
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,560
- Me?
- Yes.

653
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,690
You, Attorney Ahn Juhyeong.

654
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,750
I figured if she had to deal with her ex,
it would make her uncomfortable.

655
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,120
It looks like I was right.

656
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,750
You look very surprised.

657
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,590
I see.

658
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,300
- You came to me on purpose?
- Yes.

659
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,890
I came here on purpose to buy you.

660
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,270
We're getting divorced anyway.

661
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,350
What's the point of being polite?
It does no good for me.

662
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,860
How did you find out about me?

663
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,150
What?

664
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,570
Afraid Sujeong talked about you?

665
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,280
How did you find out?

666
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,330
Remember Jung Jihun?

667
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,450
Sujeong's friend?

668
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,120
He's always been a nuisance.

669
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,420
He's foolish and doesn't have
a filter when he talks.

670
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,840
He once got drunk in front of me
and started talking about you.

671
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,880
You don't know him?

672
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,640
Not really.

673
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,100
It doesn't ring a bell.

674
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,690
Really?

675
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Then,

676
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,190

710
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,910
Excuse me.

711
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,540
Juhyeong already left. You should go.

712
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,150
I crossed the line.

713
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,820
Why did I do that?

714
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,580
INMATE NAME: JANG SUGIL

715
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,170
<i>You think you're here as a lawyer?</i>

716
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,920
<i>You're a loser keeping me company.</i>

717
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,720
<i>People like you</i>
<i>are born into nice families</i>

718
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,100
<i>and go to expensive law schools,</i>

719
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,640
<i>where it's easier</i>
<i>to become a lawyer.</i>

720
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,600
<i>How could you even relate</i>
<i>to something like this?</i>

721
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,120
<i>Are you okay?</i>

722
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,300
<i>Now, you're not Cha Jeongho's attorney</i>
<i>and just Ahn Juhyeong, right?</i>

723
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:14,620
Law and The City

724
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:48,200
Law and The City

725
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,410
<i>I crossed the line. I'm sorry.</i>

726
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,620
What do you need
that fancy law license for?

727
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,620
Who are you, Mister?

728
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,750
<i>We're too young</i>
<i>to be criminally responsible.</i>

729
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,040
That would make me
too scared to have kids.

730
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,460
He always brings girls here
to woo them.

731
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,800
<i>What do you do to woo them?</i>

732
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,670
<i>But it won't work for Huiji.</i>

733
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,720
<i>Juhyeong, I'm a busy person too.</i>

734
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,430
- Attorney Ha Sanggi?
<i>- I bet someone got him that job.</i>

735
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,890
<i>Having fun playing a commoner?</i>

736
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:14,970
<i>Actually…</i>

737
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,770
<i>Why don't you have a meal with me?</i>

738
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:19,810
<i>A promise is a promise.</i>

739
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,990
