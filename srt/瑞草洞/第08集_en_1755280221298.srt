1
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,040
Mom.

2
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,200
Mom, what's going on?

3
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,430
Your dad was about to go to work, and the police suddenly came and arrested him.

4
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,520
Why would they arrest Dad? On what charge?

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,860
Actually, your dad got sued and

6
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,280
was being investigated.

7
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,900
What?

8
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,070
Then, you should've told me!

9
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,450
The accusations were just too absurd.

10
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,290
I didn't want you to worry for no reason.

11
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,150
What was the charge?

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,940
Fraud.

13
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,890
Fraud?

14
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,820
It must be a misunderstanding. He'll be released soon.

15
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,590
There's no way he'd do something like that.

16
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,140
Fraud of all things?

17
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,220
There's no way.

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,650
- Where are you?
- I'll call you back.

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,290
Hello.

20
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,460
What brings you here?

21
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,010
I'm here to meet a detainee.

22
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,120
Is this an attorney visitation or a family visit?

23
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,110
A family visit.

24
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,490
Mr. Kim Myeong Ho is refusing to meet you.

25
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,440
Pardon? He refused?

26
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,590
Does he know who came?

27
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,070
Yes, he agreed to come out when I said it was family.

28
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,970
But he declined when I said it was his daughter.

29
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,060
What? It's not like that, right?

30
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,240
It isn't, right?

31
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,980
Yeah, I always had faith in you, President Shin.

32
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,790
So, please give me at least my money back. Okay?

33
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,900
What do you mean you don't have it?

34
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,100
You got what I sent through President Park!

35
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,070
No.

36
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,060
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.

37
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,260
Please, I'm begging you.

38
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,660
No... that's not it.

39
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,440
Hui Ji.

40
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,460
Don't worry.

41
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,010
I'll get that money back, no matter what.

42
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,320
I'll put it all back again.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
No way...

44
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,070
Non-extendable period.

45
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,790
Attorneys must always be very careful with non-extendable periods.

46
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,200
Whether it's an appeal period or an objection period,

47
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,200
being late by even a minute is irreversible.

48
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,500
Understand?

49
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,570
- Yes.
- Yes.

50
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,880
W-Why are you looking at me?

51
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,460
You didn't submit your assignment.

52
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,740
I did! I emailed it to you.

53
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,320
The deadline was yesterday, but you submitted it past midnight at 12:05 a.m.

54
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,380
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

55
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,310
Advisor.

56
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,340
Oh, yes.

57
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,290
Can we talk for a second?

58
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,230
- Of course. You guys keep working.
- Okay.

59
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,150
Shall we go inside?

60
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,680
Would you like to take a seat?

61
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,050
No, no.

62
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,740
This isn't a sit-down conversation.

63
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,690
I'm just a bit uncomfortable with

64
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,930
how often you keep calling Attorney Ha away.

65
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,500
I would like you to stop calling him away.

66
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,560
Oh, that? Tomorrow is the last day.

67
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,230
It's true that I asked him for help at first,

68
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,110
but now, I think he enjoys it more.

69
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,040
He looks after them often.

70
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,810
Since it's good for the students,

71
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,450
and he seems to enjoy it,

72
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,610
please allow us to continue just a little longer. Please?

73
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,630
Is that what Attorney Ha said? That he enjoys this?

74
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,890
Do you want to go and watch?

75
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,310
No, no. Why would I do that?

76
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,510
Okay. I understand.

77
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,060
Okay, then. I'll head out first.

78
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,940
I was in the middle of listening, so...

79
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,800
Applause.

80
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,220
All of your assignments have failed.

81
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,400
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

82
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,640
Come on, you said the ruling would be in our favor.

83
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,170
In this case, what kind of property are we dealing with?

84
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,890
Farmland, right?

85
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,640
What does the Korean Constitution say about farmland?

86
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,830
Gyeongja Yujeon.

87
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,520
It means "Farmland may only be owned by farmers."

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,790
So, even if you won the trial,

89
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,550
you can't reclaim the land unless you're a farmer.

90
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,900
So, for this assignment,

91
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,460
you had to consider not only how to win

92
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,270
but also how to legally own the land.

93
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,650
If you think winning is everything,

94
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,370
you won't become a good attorney.

95
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
- Yes.
- Okay.

96
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,030
Let's be good friends.

97
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,750
I can't put it here.

98
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,030
Yes?

99
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,850
Attorney Jo, the decision for the voice phishing case came out.

100
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,080
The defendant was found guilty.

101
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,200
- Ms. Do Mi Gyeong's case?
- Yes.

102
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,370
She was fined 10 million won.

103
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,880
Okay, got it.

104
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,000
What the hell? This is unbelievable.

105
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,050
You are back, Attorney Kang.

106
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,710
Yes. I'm sorry for taking the morning off on short notice.

107
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,920
It's okay, no worries.

108
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,450
Is everything okay now?

109
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,890
Yes, thanks to you, it's all good now.

110
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,840
I'm glad to hear that.

111
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,260
Attorney, are you expecting a complaint to come through?

112
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,550
A fax came in under your name.

113
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,480
Oh, yes. Thank you.

114
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,340
I don't know what crypto you're referring to.

115
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,350
I never received any money.

116
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,300
Weren't you dealing with Ms. Choi Seong Mi?

117
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,600
I'll get that money back, no matter what.

118
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,150
I'll put it all back again.

119
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,480
Oh, you're back again.

120
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,820
Family visitation hours are over.

121
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,140
This is an attorney visit.

122
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,800
Please tell him to come out. Please.

123
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,780
Oh, okay.

124
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,840
Why did you come all the way here?

125
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,390
It's not even a big deal.

126
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,180
It's the same scheme you fell for yourself, Dad.

127
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,070
How did you know that?

128
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,010
You're not thinking of representing me, are you?

129
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,700
Hui Ji...

130
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
absolutely not. Listen to me.

131
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,050
That's what I came out to tell you.

132
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,770
It wasn't this, right?

133
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,920
When you said you'd put things back, no matter what,

134
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,600
you didn't mean this. Right?

135
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,510
I really don't know anything about this.

136
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,650
There must be some misunderstanding.

137
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,240
It'll get resolved soon. Don't worry.

138
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,000
Dad.

139
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,820
Don't come anymore.

140
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,940
Okay? I'll see you when I get out.

141
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,620
All right, relay this to the client.

142
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,610
Okay, thank you.

143
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,780
Aren't you close with the attorney on the 8th floor?

144
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,850
Yes, we're pretty close.

145
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,190
It appears something's going on with her family.

146
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,860
Her dad was in a holding cell.

147
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,020
Pardon?

148
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,870
I happened to see him at the station.

149
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,300
Pardon? He refused?

150
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,710
Does he know who came?

151
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,470
He agreed to come out when I said it's family.

152
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,830
But he declined when I said it was his daughter.

153
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,540
Maybe he has a criminal record.

154
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,850
They didn't seem that close.

155
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,010
I don't really know that much.

156
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,010
I guess you're not that close to her. That's good.

157
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,350
Don't get too close to her.

158
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,160
You can go.

159
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,930
- I'll do it, Mom.
- We'll hire another attorney.

160
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,100
Don't get involved.

161
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,420
What's the big deal about it? I'm an attorney.

162
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,210
If you take this case, your managing partner will find out.

163
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,160
How will you explain taking this case?

164
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,080
That your dad was arrested for fraud,

165
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,020
so you need to represent him?

166
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,600
But Dad didn't commit fraud.

167
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,260
I'll tell my managing partner that. That's enough.

168
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,410
Still, no.

169
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,300
Don't talk about this anymore.

170
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,760
We don't want you

171
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,880
getting hurt at all because of us.

172
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,840
That's how we felt when we first took you in

173
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,080
and even more so now.

174
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,260
Mom...

175
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,380
- Hello?
- Where are you? I'm currently...

176
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,090
You were here.

177
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,300
Well...

178
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,300
could you do me a favor?

179
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,400
If your firm can take this case on paper,

180
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,640
I'll handle all the actual work.

181
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I need you to handle physical appearances like visitations and trials.

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,140
And tell Mr. Na that it's just a distant acquaintance's case.

183
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,910
Are you okay?

184
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,400
Pardon?

185
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,940
You're going through a big ordeal.

186
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,670
It was tough at first,

187
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,360
but I'm okay now.

188
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,250
I'm sorry to ask you this.

189
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,240
I'll do it.

190
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,580
Kim Myeong Ho...

191
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,520
That's why I invest with President Kim Myeong Ho.

192
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,190
Since he's in the trading business,

193
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,800
he knows a lot about foreign crypto.

194
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,500
- President Kim does that kind of business, too?
- Yes.

195
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Please have a seat. I was telling them about your crypto investment business.

196
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
What exactly is it?

197
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,040
Oh, about that...

198
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm planning to buy some promising foreign cryptocurrencies.

199
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,370
Since I know the market well, if you invest through me,

200
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,160
I'll set up a digital wallet for you

201
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,770
and distribute profits, too.

202
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,970
That's not all.

203
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,040
If you bring other investors in,

204
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,650
he'll increase your profits. It's multi-level marketing.

205
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,250
So, if you want to invest, you have to do it through me. Okay?

206
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,740
Then, you'll increase my payout. Right?

207
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,860
Don't get ahead of yourself.

208
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,090
They don't even seem interested in investing.

209
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,880
Well, what's the expected return?

210
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,970
I don't know what crypto you're referring to.

211
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,200
I never received any money.

212
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
Weren't you dealing with Ms. Choi Seong Mi?

213
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,360
What are you talking about right now?

214
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,840
We clearly agreed to invest through Ms. Choi,

215
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,750
and she showed us the proof of the money transfer to you—

216
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,110
So, did I ever sign an investment contract with you?

217
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,350
We didn't, right?

218
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,060
What are you doing? Did you eat?

219
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,980
Oh, just something quick.

220
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,930
It feels like I haven't seen you in a while.

221
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,780
So...

222
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,360
do you have a moment?

223
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,040
Well...

224
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,680
is your dad okay?

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,230
What are you talking about?

226
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,790
I thought to keep pretending not to know,

227
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,960
but I was worried.

228
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,930
I heard your dad is being detained.

229
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,130
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,870
I happened to find out by accident.

231
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,100
My managing partner happened to see him at the police station.

232
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
Well...

233
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,720
he's been falsely accused.

234
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,700
- Falsely accused?
- Yeah, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

235
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,000
Which idiots detained him without investigating properly?

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,240
Was it the police or the prosecution?

237
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,070
Will you be able to handle this alone?

238
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,980
Ju Hyeong agreed to help me.

239
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,050
So, Ju Hyeong knows about it.

240
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,530
Yeah, it just happened to be.

241
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,800
Everyone was really worried

242
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,220
when they couldn't reach you yesterday, not just me.

243
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,510
Really? I had no idea.

244
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,340
I'll reach out to them.

245
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,910
Okay.

246
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,680
Got it.

247
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,750
Yes?

248
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,580
Attorney, Ms. Do Mi Gyeong is here.

249
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,290
Oh, okay.

250
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,140
Hello, Attorney.

251
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,520
- Hello. Please take a seat.
- Yes.

252
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,940
I was found guilty.

253
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,890
I got fined 10 million won.

254
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,280
Yes.

255
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,450
I heard as well.

256
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,970
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,790
No, don't be.

258
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,130
It was my fault.

259
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,940
I'm grateful for your help.

260
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,400
I've got nothing to offer you,

261
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,000
but I came back nevertheless

262
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,920
because I didn't understand what that said

263
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,080
about what happens if I can't pay the fine.

264
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,260
That's what I came to ask.

265
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm glad you came.

266
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,300
It says here that if you can't pay the fine,

267
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,200
you'll be imprisoned.

268
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,870
While you're there, you can work to pay off

269
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,150
100,000 won a day from your fine.

270
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,430
Then, I can pay it off with labor.

271
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,750
That's a relief.

272
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,200
When should I go in?

273
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,130
For this...

274
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,080
you don't voluntarily go in.

275
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,800
Don't worry about this fine. I'll pay it for you.

276
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,620
- Pardon?
- You don't have to worry. It's fine.

277
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,300
No, no.

278
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,230
What are you saying?

279
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,530
Gosh, I shouldn't have come.

280
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,500
I'm not giving it to you. I'm lending it to you.

281
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,100
- You can pay it back slowly.
- No, absolutely not.

282
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,170
- It's really okay. All right?
- Attorney.

283
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,110
Yes, I came asking for help.

284
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,450
But I didn't come for that kind of help.

285
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,570
I may not be book smart, but I know right from wrong.

286
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,620
Whether I have to steal or work it off,

287
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,670
I'll handle it myself.

288
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,460
Thank you for all your help so far.

289
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,130
Goodbye.

290
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,240
Ms. Kim, I'll head out first.

291
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Okay. Wait.

292
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,050
Come in for a second.

293
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,640
Yes?

294
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,750
There's a farewell party for the interns today, right?

295
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,030
Pay with this.

296
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,180
It's okay. The Advisor is already going to pay.

297
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,530
Just say you're treating and use this.

298
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,150
Thank you.

299
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,960
You seem to really enjoy teaching.

300
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,030
Your eyes were sparkling.

301
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,980
Pardon?

302
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,990
It was impressive.

303
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,720
Oh, yes.

304
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,470
Yes, well...

305
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,780
You can go.

306
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,260
Okay.

307
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,370
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

308
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,500
Should I close the door?

309
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,180
It's all right. Just leave it.

310
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,120
You're here.

311
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,780
Yes.

312
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,420
Did you have dinner?

313
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,410
Not yet.

314
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,220
Let's head out after sitting like this for a bit.

315
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,290
Did you read the complaint?

316
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,610
You said it's your father's case, right?

317
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,320
Yes.

318
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,770
If I take this case, even if just on paper,

319
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,190
I'll end up learning a lot more about you than you might like.

320
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,600
Will you still be comfortable with me even if that happens?

321
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,950
Of course. I'll be fine.

322
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,340
My parents passed away in an accident when I was little

323
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,700
so my aunt and uncle raised me as their own.

324
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,780
That's why my dad and I have different last names.

325
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,780
I don't care if you find out things like this.

326
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,100
If you're okay, I am, too.

327
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,730
I thought I'd prepared for...

328
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,200
something like this ever since I became an attorney.

329
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,030
But it's not as easy as I thought.

330
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,470
Don't try to carry it all alone.

331
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,200
Isn't that why you told me about it?

332
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,720
Hello. Nice to meet you for the first time.

333
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,280
My name is An Ju Hyeong.

334
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,790
Hello.

335
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,170
I heard you work with Hui Ji.

336
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,570
Yes.

337
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,830
Technically, we're not at the same firm. Feel free to speak to me openly.

338
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,120
T-That doesn't matter.

339
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,600
As long as Hui Ji doesn't handle this case.

340
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,370
Let's start by talking about the charity event.

341
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,070
Can you tell me what happened with Choi Seong Mi?

342
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,960
It was an unfamiliar setting, so I felt awkward there.

343
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,660
And President Choi wasn't next to me, either.

344
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
Hello.

345
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,730
President Kim has everything set up solidly,

346
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,030
so I have no worries.

347
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,540
Isn't that right, President?

348
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,290
Yes.

349
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,520
Thanks to President Choi, our business got some breathing room as well.

350
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,250
They are also interested in international trade.

351
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,120
If I introduce them, you have to take care of them. Okay?

352
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,960
Of course.

353
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,630
Then, you'll adjust my transaction fee rate as well. Right?

354
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes, I'll do that.

355
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,400
But you have to deal with me first. Okay?

356
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,580
President Choi is good at what she does.

357
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,160
You can trust her and do deals with her.

358
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,680
I wonder if buttering her up at the time was misunderstood.

359
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,320
So, what exactly are they accusing me of?

360
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,570
The charge is investment fraud.

361
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,300
That you colluded with Choi Seong Mi

362
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,690
to promote a fake multi-level crypto investment scheme.

363
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,080
Choi Seong Mi says she doesn't know about it

364
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,260
and claims you were the one leading it.

365
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,460
President Choi, how could she...

366
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,910
When did you first meet Choi Seong Mi?

367
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,690
About two years ago?

368
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,630
I met her while doing business with her.

369
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,540
There's a record of 900 million won being transferred to you. What was that?

370
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,630
She once urgently asked for a loan.

371
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,750
So, I took her goods as collateral

372
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,150
and lent it under the company's name and got it repaid.

373
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,640
Did you write a loan agreement?

374
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,000
- Yes.
- Do you still have it?

375
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,320
Not anymore.

376
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,200
I returned it since she repaid the loan.

377
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,940
What about the transaction history when you gave her the loan?

378
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,620
I lent it to her in cash.

379
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,570
Nine hundred million won in cash?

380
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,020
Yes.

381
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,060
I see.

382
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,550
I'm sorry if I made you worry.

383
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,350
Don't apologize.

384
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,710
Just focus on yourself. Don't worry about us.

385
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,770
Yeah.

386
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,770
Hey, Jo Chang Won—

387
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,230
What's with your reaction? Did you know about this already?

388
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,350
Well...

389
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,020
Yeah, I did, but Hui Ji didn't tell me.

390
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,680
I found out by accident.

391
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,240
If you knew, you should've given us a heads-up.

392
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,080
How could I talk about something like that?

393
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,970
Why didn't you say anything?

394
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,650
How much have you told them?

395
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,560
I told them everything.

396
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,120
All right, okay.

397
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,420
Is there anything we can help with?

398
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,180
Why ask? Of course, we should help.

399
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,940
That's why I asked.

400
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,560
Yeah, we should help, too.

401
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,930
Great. Let's work together.

402
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,850
All right, group intelligence.

403
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,560
Fighting!

404
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,550
Kim Myeong Ho says he's only known me for two years?

405
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,830
Yes. And he said you were the only one he knew at that event.

406
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,660
Look here. The weather was awful that day.

407
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,210
But Kim Myeong Ho insisted I come

408
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,070
because people with money would be coming.

409
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,270
What do you think that means?

410
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,490
What does it mean?

411
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,810
It means, "Let's try to get some money."

412
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,950
Back in 2019, I think?

413
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,840
We had plans to launch a crypto business together.

414
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,430
He said he'd do it alone this time

415
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:46,500
and promised to pay me a commission if I bring in some investments.

416
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,580
If it were that kind of event, he could've done it alone.

417
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,900
Why would he have you come when he'd have to pay you commission?

418
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,190
You don't get investments by just talking alone.

419
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,760
You need someone to hype it up next to you.

420
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
If you have someone saying they also invested, even better.

421
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,010
I'm in here because I agreed to help him with that.

422
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,970
Gosh, I shouldn't have said I invested, too.

423
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,360
Even if all of that's true,

424
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,320
you were the one recommending the investment.

425
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,940
At the very least, doesn't it make you an accomplice to fraud?

426
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,130
I had no idea the whole crypto business was non-existent!

427
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,210
That's why I even asked the investors for a kickback.

428
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,040
To give me a share of the earnings they get from Kim Myeong Ho.

429
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,930
Only then will I connect them.

430
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,500
So, who do you think is telling the truth?

431
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,310
Kim Myeong Ho or me?

432
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm here to prove that Kim Myeong Ho is telling the truth.

433
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,470
Did you go to see her?

434
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,130
What did Choi Seong Mi say?

435
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,060
Yeah. She seemed bewildered when I said your dad

436
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,000
only met her two years ago.

437
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,220
She said they prepared for a crypto business together back in 2019.

438
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,160
Oh, really? Hang on. Here you go.

439
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,590
Seems to be true that your dad was preparing a crypto business in 2019.

440
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,300
Yeah. That was when he was trying to invest in crypto.

441
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,800
That's how he got scammed.

442
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,480
If you look here,

443
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,120
there's even a partnership contract from back then.

444
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Did you verify the seal on this contract?

445
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,490
Yeah, I did.

446
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,670
It matches Hui Ji's dad's official corporate seal.

447
00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:00,280
The victims' statements also align with Choi Seong Mi's version.

448
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,900
Hey, Hui Ji, based on just the evidence,

449
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,770
Choi Seong Mi's story sounds more plausible than your dad's.

450
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,300
Timeline-wise,

451
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,800
your dad got scammed while working with her in a crypto business.

452
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,520
The real issue is

453
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,800
whether your dad made that kind of offer again

454
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,850
to Choi Seong Mi recently...

455
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,870
That's the core issue. Right?

456
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,540
Wait, do you believe this contract is real?

457
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,280
We have to consider the possibility.

458
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,840
But my dad said he didn't know Choi Seong Mi back then.

459
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,180
Then, he must not know about this contract.

460
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,580
First, the seal matches,

461
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,940
and the context fits for the existence of this contract.

462
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,840
If you look here,

463
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,100
his transactions with her first appeared around two years ago.

464
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,420
Nothing in 2022.

465
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,430
His first transaction took place in 2023.

466
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,810
It's weird that he'd do business with someone

467
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,450
he'd never had any transactions.

468
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,660
And no transactions since, either.

469
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,000
These are only circumstantial evidence.

470
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,900
But we can still look more into the context.

471
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,630
There may come a point where he has to admit guilt.

472
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,350
Then, you know how denying this

473
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,410
objective evidence could affect sentencing.

474
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,610
You need to stay level-headed.

475
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,430
Okay, how about we keep both possibilities open and go from there?

476
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,390
Yes. Hui Ji makes sense, and so does Ju Hyeong.

477
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,800
Then, for now,

478
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,640
let's object to the contract being admitted as evidence.

479
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Once we agree to it, it's hard to take it back.

480
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,190
I'll write the formal objection, so let's go with that.

481
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,040
Okay.

482
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,310
Hey.

483
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,500
This is Hui Ji's dad.

484
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,240
Aren't you treating him too much like any other client?

485
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,430
If I treat him differently, that's even worse.

486
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,540
- Still...
- I haven't concluded yet, either.

487
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,580
I'm saying that's what the evidence shows so far.

488
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,090
Hey.

489
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,380
Senior.

490
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,460
You look exhausted. Are you okay?

491
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,620
Yeah, I'm fine.

492
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,440
I heard you worked late last night, too.

493
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,210
Yeah, I was catching up on a bunch of work at once.

494
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,580
Yes, this is Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

495
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,870
You're Mr. Lee Sang Hun, right?

496
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,760
I'll finalize that draft and send it to you today.

497
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,180
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

498
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,100
Oh, right...

499
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,870
It's the summary.

500
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,200
The victims contacted me.

501
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,820
- They contacted you directly?
- Yeah.

502
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,180
They said if we want to reduce your dad's sentence,

503
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,830
we'd better pay a settlement fast.

504
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,480
Let's hear from Kim Myeong Ho's counsel regarding the evidence.

505
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,300
You're objecting to the statements from the victims and Choi Seong Mi

506
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,700
and also to the contract?

507
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,640
- Yes.
- All right, your objection is noted.

508
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,950
Prosecutor, please proceed with arranging witness examination accordingly.

509
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,010
Yes, Your Honor.

510
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,070
Then, the next hearing will be held on March 18, 2025, at 4:00 p.m.

511
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,550
for witness questioning.

512
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,980
Ms. Choi Seong Mi is also a defendant,

513
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,610
but we'll examine her as a witness.

514
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,150
The victims will follow after.

515
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,550
I don't want Hui Ji to come to court.

516
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,070
May I ask why?

517
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,930
I'm wondering if it's relevant to the truth of the case.

518
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,650
If any of what Choi Seong Mi is saying is true,

519
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,190
please tell me now

520
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,920
so I can prepare accordingly.

521
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,060
It's not like that.

522
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,900
Then, why don't you want Kang Hui Ji present?

523
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,070
No, it's not like that. Please, I'm begging you.

524
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,710
Please...

525
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,000
President Shin...

526
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,650
Do you know how it feels to show your daughter

527
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,250
a side of yourself you're ashamed of?

528
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,970
Is my dad okay?

529
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,930
He worries a lot about you.

530
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,180
He doesn't want you to come to the hearings.

531
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,260
Of course.

532
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,280
He's always worried about me.

533
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,830
It was upsetting because I assessed the situation too coldheartedly. Right?

534
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,650
No.

535
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,030
I know all of that was for my dad's sake.

536
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,680
I don't get how something like this could happen again.

537
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:56,220
Back then, he must have struggled so much on his own.

538
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,180
People flocked to him, fearing they'd lose their money.

539
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,830
He couldn't bear it and ended up shutting down his business.

540
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,990
Even after he closed the business,

541
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,950
I noticed that the company stayed registered in the records.

542
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:13,150
My dad really cherished his company.

543
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,180
Maybe because he named it after me.

544
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,090
That's why he used the

545
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,600
same corporate name again when he restarted his business.

546
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,480
Did you ever revisit that case after becoming an attorney?

547
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,470
I didn't really want to look into it

548
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,580
because I thought it'd be painful to wonder

549
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,380
if I could've stopped it then

550
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,370
if I knew what I know now.

551
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:58,780
It looks like your dad did keep cash on hand at the company.

552
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,120
I went through years of account records,

553
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,850
and there were frequent large cash withdrawals.

554
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,200
So, the claim about loaning money in cash makes sense somewhat.

555
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,360
He didn't receive the investment money,

556
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,790
but he got back the money he loaned out.

557
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,950
- Hello?
- Seriously, do you know what time it is?

558
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,000
This is Mr. Lee Sang Hun, right?

559
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,850
"I'll get it to you today, I'll get it to you today."

560
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,200
You've been saying that for days now!

561
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,380
I'm sorry. I'll get it to you today—

562
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,360
I'll send it as soon as I finish it. I'm sorry.

563
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,280
Yes, I'm really sorry.

564
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,720
What's going on?

565
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,940
I have something urgent to take care of. I'll take off first.

566
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,110
Hui Ji! Hui Ji!

567
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,980
At least, eat before you go...

568
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,940
Gosh, I don't think she even took a bite.

569
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,200
Yes?

570
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,870
Are you very busy?

571
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,910
Yeah, Senior. What's up?

572
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,130
Just because.

573
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,560
It's an embezzlement case.

574
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,210
Yeah.

575
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,840
Move.

576
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,290
What?

577
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,930
Let's take a look...

578
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,300
You're organizing the list of claims to submit with the complainant's opinion, right?

579
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,910
- Yeah, that's right.
- Move.

580
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,760
I said, move. Hurry up.

581
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,490
Gosh.

582
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,450
I can do it.

583
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,250
Leave it to me.

584
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,310
It's better for you to go and talk about your father's case.

585
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,730
Hurry up and go!

586
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,030
Thanks, Senior.

587
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,800
Let's break it down one by one.

588
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,710
If Choi Seong Mi's story is true, versus if Hui Ji's dad's story is true.

589
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,030
If Choi Seong Mi is right,

590
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,280
she tried a similar business with your father before.

591
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
And this time, she persuaded people to invest

592
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,520
while he explained the business structure to the victims.

593
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
And the past contract is the evidence for that.

594
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,150
The victims' statements also count as evidence.

595
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,150
Since they match Choi Seong Mi's story.

596
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,660
Gosh, you're right.

597
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,720
So, the problem is the victims' testimonies.

598
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,580
If Hui Ji's dad's story is right, what about the victim's statements?

599
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,630
Then, the victims aren't victims.

600
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,780
- What?
- If my dad is right,

601
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,360
those testimonies are false.

602
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,070
That means the victims are no longer just victims.

603
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,040
Let's try meeting them.

604
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,280
- Right now?
- Yeah.

605
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,740
Where did you first meet Kim Myeong Ho?

606
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,160
While doing volunteer work.

607
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,370
Do the two of you also run businesses?

608
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:18,350
No, we just have regular jobs.

609
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,060
Well...

610
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,410
The volunteer organization chaired by

611
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,660
Kim Myeong Ho is for businesspeople, though.

612
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,050
The organization that CEO Kim chairs was formed recently.

613
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,930
We met at another volunteer activity.

614
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,870
Are you happy now?

615
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,170
He said it would give us a lot of earnings

616
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,660
and to send the money through Choi Seong Mi.

617
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,830
Choi Seong Mi used that as an excuse

618
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,540
to ask for kickbacks from us.

619
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,390
So, why didn't you send the money directly to Kim Myeong Ho?

620
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,830
You knew Choi Seong Mi very briefly

621
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,860
and she even demanded kickbacks, yet you still accepted her terms?

622
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,710
What are you doing right now?

623
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,890
We thought you were going to talk about a settlement.

624
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,710
If Hui Ji's dad is telling the truth,

625
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,980
what about that 2019 contract?

626
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,480
Back then, he must have struggled so much on his own.

627
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,920
He couldn't bear it and ended up shutting down his business.

628
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,390
Kang Hui Ji said her father was scammed and closed the business,

629
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,460
then restarted it about four or five years ago.

630
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,760
You mean, he signed a contract when he was about to close his business?

631
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,270
When did you first meet Choi Seong Mi?

632
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,960
About two years ago?

633
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,320
If he got acquainted with Choi Seong Mi only recently, as Hui Ji's dad said,

634
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,480
would she know about his business closing in the past?

635
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,890
Right. She wouldn't know what happened back then if they met recently.

636
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,530
Choi Seong Mi is lying.

637
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,760
But why are the victims also lying?

638
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,310
That's what I don't understand.

639
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,500
Who says that we're lying?

640
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,160
Did she say you'd get your money back

641
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,100
by accusing Kim Myeong Ho of being a fraudster?

642
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,680
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

643
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,720
Getting your money back like that

644
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,140
won't resolve the pain you feel.

645
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,710
You'll become the deceiver instead of the deceived.

646
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,190
How I feel doesn't matter.

647
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,170
Right now, the money matters.

648
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,280
Let's go.

649
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,070
I beg you.

650
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,680
Please tell the truth.

651
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,430
I'm sorry.

652
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,710
Are you okay?

653
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,230
Yeah.

654
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,330
Come on, tell me.

655
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,650
It's just that...

656
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,760
I feel like I'm seeing my family from the past.

657
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,790
I've seen how painful it is to be the one deceived

658
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,310
rather than the one deceiving.

659
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:23,920
Losing your lifetime savings at once is unbearable.

660
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:29,150
At that point, people want their money back

661
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:33,090
more than they want the scammer punished.

662
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,260
You've been through a lot, Hui Ji.

663
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,150
Everyone's probably waiting for us.

664
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,530
Should we buy some late-night snacks?

665
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,530
- Let's do that.
- All right. My treat.

666
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,980
What do you want to eat?

667
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,230
What do you want to eat, Unni?

668
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,010
Here. Let me take a look.

669
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,640
- Hey, Chang Won.
- Yeah?

670
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,030
Look at the one from two years ago.

671
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,710
Okay. Hey, Ju Hyeong.

672
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,920
If you look at this...

673
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,550
Gosh, this is...

674
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,040
Yeah, it was around then.

675
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,340
Let's go.

676
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,260
Okay. Eat this first.

677
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,030
Hey.

678
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,500
Attorney Jo. Attorney Jo!

679
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,590
What is it?

680
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,920
I think this way is much better.

681
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,820
This and this.

682
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,630
It's correct.

683
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,910
This one's right for now.

684
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,280
That is all.

685
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,850
Kim Myeong Ho's counsel, your cross-examination.

686
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,500
Yes.

687
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,680
Witness, you said you planned a crypto business with the defendant in 2019,

688
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,090
and the defendant asked you for help to do it again.

689
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,660
Is that correct?

690
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,110
Yes, that's correct.

691
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,480
On the left is the supposed contract from back then.

692
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,640
On the right is a recent tax invoice from Kim Myeong Ho's company.

693
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,120
The business registration numbers are the same, right?

694
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,190
Yes, I would assume so.

695
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,650
Witness, were you aware that

696
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,550
Kim Myeong Ho's company had closed in July 2019?

697
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,170
Closed?

698
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,000
Here's a tax invoice from January 11, 2019.

699
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,230
That registration number disappeared when the company closed,

700
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,270
and from October 2020, a new number was used.

701
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,790
So, how could a contract written in 2019

702
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,730
have a number that only appeared in 2020.

703
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,140
You borrowed 900 million won from Kim Myeong Ho's company, right?

704
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,060
You needed to repay that to get your collateral back,

705
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,170
but you had no money, so you scammed

706
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,220
the victims for 900 million won under the pretense of investment. Correct?

707
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,900
- No, that's not true.
- Witness,

708
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,460
after you repaid your loan,

709
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,400
you got the IOU back from Kim Myeong Ho. Right?

710
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,770
Did you create a copy of the seal from the IOU and forge that contract?

711
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,260
In order to frame defendant Kim Myeong Ho?

712
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,310
No, I didn't!

713
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,290
I wonder if there's any credibility to the witness's testimony.

714
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,120
That is all.

715
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,000
The witness told police that the defendant, Kim Myeong Ho,

716
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,020
urged you to invest in the crypto business. Right?

717
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,890
Yes.

718
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:19,260
You saw how Choi Seong Mi's lies were exposed earlier. Right?

719
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,370
Is what you told the police true?

720
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,400
The credibility of Choi Seong Mi's testimony is destroyed.

721
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,200
Think carefully and don't add perjury charges to yourself.

722
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,960
Let me ask again.

723
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,860
Is it true?

724
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,780
Witness, why did you lie?

725
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,820
- Counsel.
- She said she'd get my money back first!

726
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:07,520
She said she'd give my money back first if I did what she said.

727
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,890
So, you knowingly framed Kim Myeong Ho

728
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,100
when you knew Choi Seong Mi was the culprit?

729
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,340
At first, I didn't.

730
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,300
At first, I really thought I invested with CEO Kim.

731
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:22,340
But thinking back, CEO Kim never even mentioned crypto.

732
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,350
All he did was just go along with what Choi Seong Mi said.

733
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,310
So, when you confronted Choi Seong Mi,

734
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,500
did she tell you to frame Kim Myeong Ho?

735
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,610
When I asked her what happened,

736
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,970
she said she had no money to pay us back.

737
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,420
Even if she went to prison, we wouldn't get our money back.

738
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,990
She said to listen to her if we want to get some money back.

739
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,860
I didn't know things would go this far.

740
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,870
I'm sorry.

741
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,900
Hi.

742
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,990
- What is this?
- Get in.

743
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,570
Your struggles are over today.

744
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,260
Hurry up and get in.

745
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,940
Hey, a different attorney got in earlier, and it was so awkward.

746
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,700
We went up and down a few times.

747
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,250
We were holding the elevator.

748
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,370
Really?

749
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,290
We'll proceed with the afternoon verdict.

750
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:12,740
Case number 2025-Gohap-194.

751
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,390
Defendants Kim Myeong Ho and Choi Seong Mi.

752
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:22,340
The court sentences the defendant Choi Seong Mi to seven years in prison.

753
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:26,400
Defendant Kim Myeong Ho is found not guilty.

754
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,940
Eat up.

755
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,500
You really went through a lot.

756
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,630
Hui Ji had it the hardest.

757
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:16,470
I'm sorry that I did this again.

758
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,350
Dad.

759
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,180
You've always been a good dad.

760
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,780
Stop trying so hard and lean on me now.

761
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:41,310
Hurry up and eat. Eat up.

762
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,480
Okay?

763
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,570
It's on me today!

764
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,440
I'm paying today. Everyone eat up!

765
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,950
I picked the menu.

766
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,980
No, rather, my baby did.

767
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,540
Thank you all so much. I couldn't have done this alone.

768
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,740
Come on, it was because you did great.

769
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,600
Anyway, looking good.

770
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,760
Senior, your plate.

771
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,200
Thank you.

772
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,420
Thank you.

773
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,840
Gosh, how long do we have to play ignorant?

774
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,090
I know, right? We're attorneys. We're quick.

775
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:12,230
Yeah. So, should we wait a little longer or what?

776
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,900
A-About that...

777
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,590
If you know already, no need to say anything.

778
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,380
Today, instead of food photos,

779
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,020
I'll take photos of you two.

780
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,820
- Could you come together?
- Get close.

781
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,970
Get closer together. Okay.

782
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:41,400
All right. Two, three!

783
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,720
Gosh, you two look great together.

784
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,720
- What's up?
- Surprise!

785
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,590
- What is this?
- It's fruit.

786
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,140
You said you wanted fruit this morning.

787
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,330
Just in case, I cut up a bunch.

788
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,400
Eat it little by little whenever you want.

789
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,710
Thanks.

790
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,380
I'll be heading out.

791
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,790
Oh, right. When can you start using your maternity leave?

792
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,400
- Maternity leave?
- Yeah.

793
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,850
Do I start thinking about that already?

794
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,000
It came up while talking to the doctors.

795
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,180
It's better to plan things in advance because of our schedule.

796
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,830
I haven't thought about it.

797
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:41,270
That's okay. Think it over slowly while eating the fruit.

798
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,820
- Okay.
- Then, I'll be going.

799
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,500
See you.

800
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,760
Press one.

801
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,120
Right! Bye!

802
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,550
Maternity leave?

803
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,770
Yes, come in.

804
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:38,980
What's going on?

805
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:44,410
Mr. Na, what's the process for applying for maternity or parental leave?

806
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:48,350
Not sure. I don't think that's ever been a thing here.

807
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:49,700
Not even once?

808
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,650
No, usually people just resigned. Why?

809
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,430
Are you pregnant?

810
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,930
Yes, it's still been only a few weeks.

811
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,140
Then, you still have some time.

812
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,680
Let's talk about it again later.

813
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,020
But this is a legal right.

814
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:10,400
Is this something to discuss later?

815
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:15,090
Come on, you know how this works.

816
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,290
How many cases are you handling right now?

817
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,800
About 50.

818
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,060
What do we do with those?

819
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,350
Should Attorney An and I split them 25 each

820
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,780
when we already have 50 each?

821
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,450
And it's not easy to hire a temporary attorney for just three or six months.

822
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,260
Not that I want to, either.

823
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:34,260
You know clients don't like it when their attorney keeps changing.

824
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,190
That's true, but this is my legal right.

825
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,920
I know it's your right, Attorney Bae.

826
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:43,930
Okay, I'll seriously consider it.

827
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,340
Since we have some time, let's discuss it again later.

828
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,390
Yes, this is Na Kyeong Min.

829
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,590
Yes, yes.

830
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,720
I sent that to you yesterday.

831
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,110
Yes, I sent you an email.

832
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:06,360
Well, I understand, but if you say it like that...

833
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,940
Yes.

834
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,880
- Will you arrange that tomorrow?
- Oh, sorry!

835
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,030
Yes, I think it's best to coordinate during your visit.

836
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,030
Yes. Okay.

837
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:17,470
All right.

838
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,710
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

839
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,640
Yes, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

840
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,530
He's not available right now.

841
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,090
Yes, sorry about that.

No, I'll handle it.

Your mom's not feeling well today, so I'm covering for her.

Are you confused because you have an office at the law firm?
