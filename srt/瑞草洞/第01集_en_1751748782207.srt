Through the courts and procuratorates

Right side door

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,450
Going to Dahua, Jiubabo, Wuqin Station...

8
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,200
There's a man here

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,800
Wearing black suit and white shirt

10
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,970
Judging from his face, he might have slept with a tie on last night.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,850
Although it is a 30-minute commuter route by subway Line 3

12
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,810
His tired expression looked like he had walked for three years.

13
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,190
Even if I doze off due to fatigue

14
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,190
Professional office workers who still open their eyes at the previous stop

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,660
Seocho-dong has more legal firms than restaurants

16
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,120
That's where he works.

"Everyone has a resignation letter in their heart"

19
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,750
He is full of the atmosphere of an office worker who seems to shout like this

20
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,170
Damn, it's so cold

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,382
But he will still do his assigned work without complaint.

22
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,467
A model employee

23
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,806
Most employed lawyers only last five years before they open their own businesses.

24
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,518
Or transform into a corporate lawyer and a new record in Seocho-dong is just around the corner

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,070
Although the end of get off work time is infinitely far away, he always keeps to the working time on time

26
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,700
I am a salaried lawyer with my ninth year of assistant experience!

27
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,410
(Assistant lawyers are employed by legal entities and receive monthly salaries)

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,200
Man dreams of the end of get off work that never seems to come

29
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,200
Entering the elevator of Hongmin Building

30
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,330
A short sigh like a yawn

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,010
You came really early

32
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,840
At this time, the man spoke to someone

33
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,350
Aren't you tired of all the noise so early in the morning?

34
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,930
I'm noisy because I'm tired.

35
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,810
I have a meeting in the morning.

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,770
That's why I dragged myself out. It's hard.

37
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,730
But on the way I received a message saying that the meeting was delayed by some time?

38
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
8:35

39
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,150
Humans don't know manners.

42
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
You are here. Hello.

43
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,460
Good morning

(Lawyer An Zhouheng)

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,870
Oh my god, I really don't want to do this

46
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,850
Hello

47
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,230
Open your eyes.

48
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,650
What time did you go home yesterday? Two o'clock

49
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,280
Hey good morning everyone

50
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,490
Why are you hanging around here without a briefcase?

51
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,740
I've been here for a long time

52
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,750
I had a meeting in the morning and I managed to drag myself out.

53
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,790
I received a message that the meeting was delayed.

54
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,040
What time? 8:35

55
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,800
Oh my god! Humans have no manners.

56
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,340
There were three people taking the elevator but you only pressed your own floor.

57
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,220
Like you...

58
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,270
I'll help you press it next time

59
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,890
Every time I just say

60
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,060
At least I still have to say

61
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,150
Really

62
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,190
Is Wenting going to court today? No matter if she is there or not, she can't come now.

63
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,700
Also correct

64
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,820
I'm leaving!

65
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,820
What are we going to eat for lunch?

66
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,700
Wen Ting said yesterday that she wanted to eat bean sprout hangover soup

67
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,040
What are we going to eat?

68
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,620
See you on the fifth floor!

71
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,210
Makes people upset

72
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,750
very good!

73
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,550
Earned money? Earned money

74

How much do you earn? 8800 won

75
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,490
The defendant did not kill the victim

76
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,240
The third person at the scene is the real criminal.

77
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,080
Your Honor

78
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,750
The defendant did not kill the victim

79
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,330
At the crime scene

80
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,460
In addition to the defendant and the victim, there are others

81
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,750
This third person is the real criminal.

82
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,260
A witness who can reveal all the truth...

83
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,550

(Second year)

88
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm so depressed.

89
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,180
I didn't hit anyone.

90
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,350
Only get beaten

91
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,180
I am so wronged

92
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,440
real…

93
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,270
It's really unfair.

94
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,720
(Third year)

95
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,940
I didn't sue for money.

96
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,490
That young man is really bad.

97
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,610
I just want him to gain some social experience.

98
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,240
So please just take it easy.

99
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,750
But at least you still have to get the money for the goods.

100
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,460
Oh my god, no need

101
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,960
I don't need that money

102
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,710
Look at this, Your Honor.

103
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,840
How am I supposed to pay for this?

104
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,470
Damn, you lost?

105
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,220
Didn't you say not to worry?

106
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,730
Do you know what will happen if I don't get that money, little brat?

107
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,060
How can we win if the product is in that state?

108
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,690
What did you say, brat?

109
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,770
You... Purser!

110
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,820

112
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,970
Really delicious

113
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,930
Boss, another bottle of soju.

114
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,100
tasty

115
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,650
Auntie, give me some more meat

116
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,230
Your chicken feet are here.

(ninth year)

118
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,540
Although I must stand on the client's side in court

119
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,630
But that doesn't mean I have to be their friend.

120
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,920
It took me nine years to understand that.

121
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,260
(Today's court session schedule)

122
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,240
come on!

123
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,790
Your Honor

124
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,250
The witness who can reveal the truth is just outside the door.

125
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,090
Your Honor

126
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,260
I request to call the witness in this case.

127
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,010
Go to the next case

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,680
2024 General Civil Case No. 3923

129
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,150
Who is the plaintiff's attorney?

130
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,200
Attorney An Zhouheng of Jingmin Law Firm attended the hearing as the plaintiff's attorney.

131
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,240
This part has been recorded in the last written document.

132
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,040

Dear?

134
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,720
Please sit down and speak into the microphone

135

(Defendant's seat, Plaintiff's seat)

137
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,650
This lawyer...

138
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,110
Are you the defendant's attorney?

139
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,570
yes

140
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,360
Book…

141
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,530
This litigation attorney is about this case...

142
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,830
Request to call witnesses

143
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,060
Okay, please go back today and submit a request to subpoena a witness.

144
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,060
What?

145
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,480
but…

146
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,770
The witness is here today so what?

147
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,400
Now there is no stenographer, no time, nothing.

148
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,950
Your Honor!

149
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,450
Could you at least explain why I'm calling for witnesses?

150
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,130
I have dozens of hearings today alone.

151
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,670
Even if you explain it now, I can't remember it.

152
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,090
Please submit written information

153
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,970
The next court session is on January 14 at 4 p.m.

154
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,090
May I?

155
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,470
It's the plaintiff's agent, no problem.

156
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
What about the defendant's attorney?

157
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,100
What?

158
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,310
Yes, sorry, please wait.

159
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,360
What number did he say?

160
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
14th 14th…

161
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,660
Yeah, I should be able to.

162
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,550
sorry

163
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,810
Don't learn defense from TV dramas

164
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,020
Come early and learn from the previous hearing.

165
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,770
Yes, thank you.

166
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,230
Because no one told me this.

167
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,440
I'm not saying this for your thanks.

168
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,820
It's because you delayed the trial.

169
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,490
Besides, that drama was a criminal case and this case is a civil lawsuit.

170
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,950
If you want to watch it, you have to find the right type

171
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,590
I will email you after I have sorted out the information.

172
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,350
yes

173
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,850
What?

174
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,190
No, I'm taking the subway.

175
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,270
It's very quiet today.

176
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,190
Anyway... please come early

177
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,690
It's a representative!

178
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,860
yes

179
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,620
Right?

180
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,700
Lawyer An, you are late!

181
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,100
This is the Techcle case that was sentenced last week.

182
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,100
There is also the judgment of the Seoul Comprehensive Case

183
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,270
You won both cases.

184
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,810
Congratulations! Good

185
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,240
This is the verdict of the Park Jung-won case.

186
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,860
The case was lost.

187
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,410
Okay, thank you.

188
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,830
The representative said there is a case of violence that needs your consultation.

189
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,290
Now?

190
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,960
Are you busy?

191
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,630
No, of course I have to do what he tells me to do.

192
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,760
I'll be there soon

193

(Representative lawyer of Luo Jingmin)

195
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,110
Lawyer An treated me the same way.

196
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,450
Don't worry, at least he does a good job.

197
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,410
Do lawyers not care so much about winning or losing?

198
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,090
Damn it!

199
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,170
(Reject the plaintiff's request)

200
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,300
What a jerk.

201
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,390
yes

202
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,800
Please do that.

203
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,010
OK, thanks

204
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
yes?

205
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,060
Good transfer in

206
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,480
Hello, I am Lawyer Liu Dongxu

207
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,120
Thanks for your hard work

208
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,000
Please review and analyze this.

209
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,000
Representative... Can it be finished by tonight?

210
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,920
Okay, tomorrow night.

211
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,390
Oh my god, I'm so annoyed

212
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,730
It's a lot of work, right? I've asked them to give out bonuses.

213
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,030
You'll get it. Where are you going?

214
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,660
(Haozhan Law Firm, one million)

215
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,030
Before tonight?

216
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
Before lunch

217
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,290
good

218
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,390
Does Lawyer Zhao have a consultation case now?

219
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,060
But I have a meeting in ten minutes.

220
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,850
Just finish it in ten minutes.

221
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,140
Anyway, the streets of Seocho-dong are full of cats and dogs.

222
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,560
If he doesn't hire a lawyer, he should leave immediately.

223
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,730
What?

224
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,450
I see

225
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,370
I am always asked to do this kind of chore

226
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,960
Don't you have any solution?

227
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,010
No, it's a bit...

228
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,180
This is the governor of our district.

229
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,680
She would go with me wherever I went for consultations

230
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,480
Our commander is very good at judging people.

231
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,940
lawyer

232
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,450
yes?

233
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,030
Your luck is very good.

234
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Yeah?

235
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,830
Very good looking

236
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,040
Entrust them with the job.

237
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,880
You will definitely win

238
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,210
Oh my god!

239
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,590
She said she will definitely win the case, lawyer!

240
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,050
But…

241
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,260
How good is my luck?

242
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,430
I do often hear people say that I have beautiful ears. Can you help me take a look at my ears?

243
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,700
The court session is tomorrow?

244
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,700
I thought about it for too long so it's a bit late

245
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
So that's it

246
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,870
The result of your first trial was a stay of sentencing.

247
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,160
It is a crime of injury rather than violence.

248
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,370
In April…

249
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Postponement of sentencing

250
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,550
You confessed at the first trial, why do you want to appeal?

251
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,260
I didn't actually hit him.

252
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,930
Why did you admit it at the first trial?

253
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,510
I'm afraid things will get out of hand.

254
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,890
Anyway, judging by the wind direction at the time, everyone seemed to believe what the other person said.

255
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,230
So I'm just going to admit it and get it over with.

256
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,360
After all, I have to work

257
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,570
Mr. Park Kyung-hyun, are you a celebrity? Because I don't know many celebrities.

258
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,070
No

259
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,830
no

260
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,950
I am not

261
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,330
So what else is going to happen?

262
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,380
I felt very scared.

263
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,760
But then I thought about it and I felt that this was not right

264
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
So I want to reveal the truth

265
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,930
Only then will I come here

266
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,350
Otherwise, why would I do this now?

267
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,640
You just want to reveal the truth

268
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,190
Okay, let's just leave it like that.

269
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,520
How did you get to know the victim?

270
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,270
yes…

271
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,860
I am a tax accountant and he is my regular customer.

272
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,080
We had an argument about the handling fee so he insisted that I was violent towards him

273
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,750
Did the fee change midway?

274
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,870
No

275
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,920
That's just his one-sided statement.

276
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,770
As you can see, I don't have many clients.

277
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,070
So every customer is precious to me.

278
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,610
Why would I want to beat up my clients anyway?

279
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,450
OK, I know you plead not guilty.

280
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,580
We will make a copy of the evidence records and contact you after reviewing them.

281
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,630
that's all?

282
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
right

283
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,560
How many?

284
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,680
Please go here

285
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,560
Please sit here and sort it out!

286
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,440
What is this? A funeral?

287
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,990
oh

288
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,990
Pei Wenting hasn't come yet

289
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,450
Who knows what she'll say if we eat first?

290
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,570
Oh my god

291
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,330
Welcome Hello

292
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,880
How many people? My companion is inside.

293
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
good

294
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,380
Eat it

295
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,550
Really, hurry up.

296
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,670
It makes us have to look at other people's eyes

297
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,010
Boss, everyone is here!

298
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,430
You were late this morning too, right?

299
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,260
I'm not you. I'm going to court.

300
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,060
Really? Why are you late every day?

301
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,350
Do you know what time I arrived? I had a meeting in the morning...

302
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,940
Strictly speaking, I don't think I was late

303
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,030
Why do we have to follow working hours when the off-work hours are not fixed?

304
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,360
That's just a general principle.

305
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
Don't you have fixed working hours? Only we have

306
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,490
What's the price increase here?

307
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,660
Even this is more than our meal budget. Where should we go next?

308
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,630
Your meal fee is so low, it's still 8,000 won?

309
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,500
If it's over 8,000, just use Dongxu's company card like last time.

310
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,380
I have to consider other people's expressions, so just brush mine.

311
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,720
Do you have a company card now?

312
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,680
Oh my god, when I was with you, I didn't even have money for meals. The treatment has become much better.

313
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,220
No, I mean I paid out of my own pocket.

314
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,220
Am I doing this for money?

315
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,480
You do it for the money.

316
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,480
Yes, you are amazing.

317
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,020
Why would you immediately jump to a higher position just because you are paid a little more?

318
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,780
Please change jobs or start your own business.

319
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,580
Auntie, please give us more carrot cubes.

320
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,950
Do you want to make back your money by eating carrot cubes?

321
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,580
Eat first and then order. I will finish it.

322
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,130
Is that all right? Please give us more carrot cubes. Sinch has finished eating.

323
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,350
I want to get off work already

324
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,600
Are you afraid that others don't know you are a grandfather?

325
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,940
Are you drinking Guoba soup?

326
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
Thanks

327
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,690
It's weird that you guys drink iced Americano when the weather is so cold

328
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,030
You will really freeze to death in the end.

329
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,530
What did you drink today?

330
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,360
Strawberry Yogurt Smoothie

331
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,490
It's not suitable for you, don't drink that kind of stuff

332
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,990
Don't force yourself to drink coffee

333
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,290
That's cheating your body.

334
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,830
Should I call you grandpa too?

335
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,790
Is it OK to just write it here?

336
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,630
What is he doing? What if you don't drop the lawsuit?

337
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,460
You have to trust me so we can reach a settlement.

338
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,840
Oh my god, that's so simple.

339
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,130
You are here again. Stay quiet.

340
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,800
Everyone here is a lawyer, just stay quiet.

341
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,010
changwon

342
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,310
I really don't understand how a casual person like you can get full marks in the exam

343
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,940
So I took the bar exam five times before I finally passed.

344
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,480
Well done! We are the best in Changwon…

345
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,030
minister

346
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,820
How are you?

347
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,360
The capitalist smile that I hate so much

348
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,370
Oh my god, I should have contacted you first. I'm sorry.

349
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,700
Is there a way for visually impaired people to commit violence?

350
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,290
Of course they have the means to commit violence and kill people

351
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,130
Is this a lack of bias or a waiver of defense?

352
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,050
Visually impaired people are not blind.

353
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,340
Many people can sense light and see outlines

354
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,970
That’s why we’re writing this!

355
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,140
Okay, time for us to go, huh?

356
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
But…

357
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,560
By the way, you haven't forgotten tonight, have you?

358
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,020
Um, I have a blind date, can I go later?

359
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,560
Go again? You should stop too.

360
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,110
What time? 6:30

361
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,150
Then let's meet at eight o'clock, okay?

362
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,030
You only need an hour or two anyway, right?

363
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,740
this…

364
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,490
If I am satisfied with the other person, I might stay longer.

365
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,670
How? What?

366
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,090
Yes, that's possible.

367
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,380
Why are you laughing?

368
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,880
You obviously want to laugh too.

369
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,970
Wanna make a bet?

370
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,340
I bet he is not satisfied with the other party 10,000 won

371
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,970
I bet 10,000 won too. I'm the same.

372
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,810
What's going on? This betting can't be established.

373
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,560
Then I bet that he is satisfied with the other party.

374
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,850
You have to bet on the opposite to win big money

375

She's like a moth to a flame again.

376
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,770
And you

377
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,480
Why do you continue to go on blind dates when you are obviously not satisfied every time?

378
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,730
In my opinion

379
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,570
Your chances of success on a blind date are lower than winning the lottery

380
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,660
At least someone really won the lottery

381
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,030
I might also meet my destined one.

382
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,210
Really

383
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,130
This is the funniest thing you've said this year... No, this is the funniest thing you've said

384
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,750
What do you mean by destiny? It's too bad for you.

385
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,460
Have you ever had that experience?

386
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,880
Yeah once

387
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,050
Although it is not a blind date, what is it?

388
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,350
Uh... dreaming!

You want to beat someone up for money?

397

Stop talking nonsense!

398
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,620
You can't do this to me!

399
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,040
Kim Seung Guk!

400
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,910
What are you doing Kim Seungkook?

401
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,670
Why? Because I'm a regular customer.

402
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,050
So that day I carefully asked him for a discount on the handling fee.

403
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,260
But he suddenly got excited and started throwing things around

404
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,140
Is it that difficult for me to say that the handling fee is cheaper?

405
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,810
Why do you keep playing tricks on me? Why?

406
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,770
I instinctively picked up my phone and called the emergency number but couldn't get through

407
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,400
So I ran to the phone in the office

408
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,570
Pick up the phone and call the police

409
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,700
He ended up hanging up the phone.

410
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,330
Later I found out that I couldn't make an emergency call.

411
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,670
Because I accidentally pressed the record button

412
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,630
Let me go!

413
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,430
I didn't actually hit him.

414
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,350
But then I thought about it and I felt that this was not right

415
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,520
So I want to reveal the truth

416
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,690
Oh my god, then I have to go and see the scene?

417
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,910
Looks like I have to go.

418

right

428
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,760
My friend is afraid that I will be unhappy because of that incident

429
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,890
Want me to change my mood and help me do it again

430
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,760
But I don't know

431
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,390
yes

432
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,390
I sit on the sofa

433
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
good

434
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,870
You put it right in front of me.

435
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,500
This space is entirely in my head

00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,590
yes

437
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,350
I've seen all the evidence.

438
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,180
You were found guilty despite your plea of innocence at the first trial.

439
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,310
What is the evidence?

440
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,820
Broken objects and photos of the scene

441
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,860
Photos of the parts that were subjected to violence, and audio recordings of the violence

442
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,490
The recording and photos are consistent with the victim's testimony.

443
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,570
So that's it

444
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
I think he was recording.

445
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,710
You talk to him casually.

446
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
right

447
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,790
He is a frequent visitor...

448
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,420
We are about the same age, so I speak more casually.

449
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,470
You can probably tell from the recording.

450
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,720
He seems to be destroying things himself

451
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,680
Then he said some weird things as if I did something to him

452
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,600
And made the sound of hitting myself

453
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,060
Are you saying that Mr. Kim Seung-guk is directing and acting in the film himself?

454
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,150
right

455
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,230
Because he keeps saying weird things.

456
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,530
So I told him to stop talking nonsense.

457
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,490
I pushed him too.

458
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,330
But why didn't you say this this morning?

459
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,460
Are you going to listen to me?

460
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,250
About half a year ago

461
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,710
He often said that he was almost driven to death by money.

462
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,840
Judging from his tax return, his situation is indeed not good.

463
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,760
Then it makes sense for him to ask for a discount on the handling fee.

464
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,600
No that...

465
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,480
He never said that kind of thing. In fact, that day...

466
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,280
You didn't come to me about tax matters.

467
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:44,490
Are you saying he came here and pretended to be assaulted and then recorded the incident?

468
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
That's right.

469
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,830
I have no reason to hit him.

470
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,680
It's six o'clock

471
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,600
I'm taking blood pressure medicine. Sorry, please wait a moment.

472
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,310
good

473
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,200
Can I use the restroom?

474
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Of course

475
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,090
The restroom is here, please.

476
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,510
Okay, thank you.

477
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,370
Which one to start?

478
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,200
Anyway, start first and then continue

479
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,250
So... I kind of...

480
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,210
But you have to drink what Dongxu wants to drink.

481
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,500
Anyway, you can reach 900 million

482
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,920
I think it's ok. It tastes good.

483
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,040
But it doesn't mean I have to drink with you.

484
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,670
If you hit... This is your last day

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,380

00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,130

487
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Really? What?

488
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,550
"I'll be late"

489
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,680
What?

490
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,270
What? It seems he is very satisfied with this blind date

491
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,640
Not in trouble? Really?

492
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,730
I sent him a message

493
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,650
Isn't it because the journey is too far? Is it possible?

494
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,940
I had a great time today

495
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,230
Me too

496
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,110
We didn't get to talk much.

497
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,900
What a shame

498
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,410
I'll contact you again

499
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,580

00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,080
Turn it again like this.

507
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,580
Enough! Got it

508
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,750
Are you still blogging? That "Lawyer's Table"?

509
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,290
Right?

510
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,090
Are you a grandfather? Who blogs now? Everyone uses social media

511
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,920
But we got a lot of sponsorship.

512
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,890
At most, it's just a free meal.

513
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,720

What's wrong with you? What happened?

518
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,650
How's that? Didn't you say you might be late?

519
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
Well, I'm late.

520
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,570

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,490

00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,620
Hello!

525
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,330
What happened? Why is 100 yuan missing?

526
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,210
I am the one who sent the money for the transfer fee

527
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,470
Oh my god

528
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,510
If the blind date wasn't that good, you should have come earlier. Why did you arrive only now?

529
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,430
You have to come earlier than the protagonist, it doesn't matter

530
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,720
Okay, pick up your glass and raise it to celebrate

531
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,060
It's not something worth celebrating, just drink it. Of course, resigning is worth celebrating. Cheers!

That's why I suggested coming here. I agree that the taste is great.

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,470
You should open your business. You've been here for too long.

544
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,220
If you're still here next year I'm going to tell the TV guys

545
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,060
"Lawyer who worked as an assistant for ten years"

546
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,730
It's too troublesome to open a business. She hasn't opened a business yet. We are in the same period.

547
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,190
I passed the exam a year later than you and have been a litigator for only a short time.

548
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,730
I have been a lawyer for a long time in the public sector and also in the corporate sector.

549
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,570
But why did you switch to being a litigator?

550
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,450
Because organized life is not for me

551
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,450
Anyone can see that you are not suited to organized life

552
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,240
How come it took you four years to figure that out?

553
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,370
Do you think opening a business is troublesome?

554
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,830
Of course you don't think so?

555
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,960
All have to start from scratch

556
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,920
And there is the possibility of bankruptcy

557
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,050
It's annoying to be a paralegal and just do what you're told. Don't you want to do things the way you want?

558
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,590
If I open a business, will anyone give me a case?

559
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,140
At that time, we have to accept everything. How can we choose?

560
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,430
But at least you can turn down jobs you really don't want to do.

561
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,890
It's still easiest to do what you're told.

562
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,770
Now I am finally getting started with my job and feel comfortable

563
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,650
Salary comes in on time

564
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,780
So this feels like...

565
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,340
Watch out! Quick!

566
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
quick!

567
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,340
run!

568
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,250
Well, now you're going to end your life as an assistant lawyer.

569
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,170
Opening your own business

570
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
quick!

571
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,180
To win! Come on!

572
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,260
I don't want

573
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,230
"I don't want to"? What?

574
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,480
The point is not that the problem is that the bomb exploded

575
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,530
I thought it was a war but it turned out to be just training.

576
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,110
You are wearing a down jacket. Haven't you ever been a soldier?

577
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,610
The way he explains it seems to be different every year.

578
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,780
Each time it escalates slightly and becomes more and more unreasonable

579
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,120
This is just a metaphor. What are you going to do after you leave your job?

580
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,710
I want to take a rest and think about what to do next

581
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,130
If you have a month off, what would you do?

582
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,710
What to do?

583
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,840
I will... take a month off.

584
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,880
It's too hard to come back to work. I'll just take a week off.

585
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,260
Don't pour cold water on me.

586
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,680
I will go abroad first

587
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Is it paid leave or unpaid leave?

588
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:09,400
Rather than resting, I plan to make future plans, so I don't have time to travel.

589
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Go away!

590
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,560
Such a bummer.

591
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,190
Then don't go to these crazy people

592
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,530
I'm still interested in asking myself...

593
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,030
By the way, have you found a new person for your vacancy?

594
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,910
No, although I heard there is an interview tomorrow.

595
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,700
But since I couldn't find anyone, I just left the handover information.

596
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,160
I also wrote your contact number.

597
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,830
You should have plenty of time to come and teach Dawan occasionally.

598
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,670
Okay, let's have a drink.

599
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,880

601

congratulations!

602
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,720
I want to go abroad first. Where should I go?

603
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,760
Banff, Canada Do you know Banff?

604
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,720
If you don't eat eggplant, I'll pack it up.

605
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,270
Who will I eat with?

606
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,600
Rocky Mountains with whom?

607
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,140
No one has touched the packaging yet.

608
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,230
Who am I talking to? I'm asking you who you're going with

609
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,400
It's not about who you go with.

610
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,270
Eat this up Rocky Mountains…

611
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,750

612

613

Does it smell like damn alcohol?

614
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,090
Of course

615
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,550
Did you see this?

616
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,680
What?

617
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,310
Brother Dongxu left the chat group?

618
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,890
I also subpoenaed him to ask if he got home safely.

619
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,020
But he didn't even look at it

620
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,560
That's too much. You said you wanted to meet again yesterday.

621
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,150
I asked him to leave the group.

622
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,280
Why? That's our dinner party group.

623
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,030
It would be weird if he kept it.

624
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,570
Seeing us post things he doesn't know about every day will only make him feel annoyed

625
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,870
But it shouldn't be like that.

626
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:50,000
Why keep someone who wants to leave? His heart is no longer with you anyway.

627
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,910
You are so heartless.

Including the internship period, only seven months have passed.

641
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Why are you changing jobs so soon?

642
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,290
Because I've been doing repetitive things

643
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,410
I think there is nothing to learn there.

644
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,750
I've resigned too.

645
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:44,250
Are you quitting your job before finding a new one?

646
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,670

Okay, ask.

Is that too rude? Sorry, no.

Good question

Why did I become a lawyer?

660
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,060
Because I want to solve the problems around me myself

661
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,230
So have you done it now?

Yes, I know

Why on earth would you do this?

733
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,860
Help! I made the sound of hitting myself.

734
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,820
What are you actually doing?

735
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,280
Because he keeps saying weird things.

736
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,660
So I told him to stop talking nonsense.

737
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,320
I pushed him too.

(257, Gil-eum-ro 8-lan, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul)

745
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,120
I know we drank a lot yesterday.

746
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,040
So of course I'll have soybean sprout hangover soup for lunch today

747
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,210
But why did we have the same thing for lunch yesterday?

748
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,720
Are we stupid? I knew it a long time ago.

749
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,590
Then you should say it.

750
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,550
We will eat it today, so we shouldn't eat it yesterday.

751
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,680
Because I can eat it for two days without any problem

752
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,970
I'm so annoyed. At least you should say it.

753
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,430
What? You...

754
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,020
never mind

755
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,870
When will the person who will take over Brother Dongxu arrive? Didn't he leave our phone number?

756
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,620
She contacted me and it seems she went straight to work today

757
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,870
What? Today?

758
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,500
Isn't she having an interview today?

759
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,040
She seems anxious.

760
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,880
Need money urgently? Meet later and observe for yourself

761
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,590
I made an appointment with her for dinner.

762
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,170
But I have a date with my girlfriend tonight

763
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,220
Which girlfriend? A while ago

764
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,760
The girl I passed by when I passed by Gangnam Station was so pretty

765
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,720
He was just teasing you, he didn't really want to ask you

766
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,760
I know, but I have to answer.

767
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,430
Then I told her to have a simple dinner first.

768
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,060
Wanna have a beer later?

769
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,600
Have a beer? Okay.

770
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,400
Can you drink more today after drinking so much yesterday?

771
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,570
Then don’t drink it!

772
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,820
If you dare, try a drink.

773
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,610
Obviously they will drink in the end but they keep nagging all day

774
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,870
If you have an argument with me, will you pretend not to know me?

775
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,700
This guy changed the subject again

776
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,580
Is what happened just now so serious? No

777
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,880
Do you pretend you don't know someone after you break up with them?

778
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,960
Probably not.

779
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,460
I also know the boundaries. Since we broke up, of course I won't contact each other again.

780
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,170
Right?

781
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,300
Anyway, continuing what I just said

782
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,590
After I broke up with my ex-girlfriend...

783
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,930
It's so noisy. Where is the noise coming from?

784
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,890
I just started talking about it. It's really noisy.

785
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,600
I will speak slowly

786
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,390
After I broke up with my ex-girlfriend... Don't say

787
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,520
Never mind. I won't say anything.

So is the person next to him the plaintiff?

804
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,500
I am a lawyer

805
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,130
So that's it

806
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,670
A lawyer?

807
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,920
right

808
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,130
Oh my god, I was so nervous

809
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,640
So I promised to accompany you, didn't I? And the verdict was also very smooth.

810
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,260
Thank you so much

811
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,680
I'm actually really worried.

812
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:07,520
Really? I told you not to worry, Lawyer Kang!

813
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,150
represent

814
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,940
Wait, you said you were going to hear the verdict at the central government?

815
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,990
Are you coming to the central court?

816
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,200
Say hello. This is the representative of the company that just hired me.

817
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,280
Hello

818
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,490
Hello

819
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,620
You and she are old acquaintances, so you came together to hear the verdict, right?

820
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,960
Actually, we didn't know each other.

821
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,090
I became familiar with her because I took on her case.

822
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,670
She was originally just your client?

823
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,300
That's right.

824
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,680
Then I'll go back to the office first.

825
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,220
good

826
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,300
See you later

827
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,950
You came really early. There is still some time.

828
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,910
yes

829
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,660
Here is what you said

830
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,960
That's right.

831
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,590
I have read the complaint written by Mr. Jin Chengguo

832
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,300
The address and other parts should have been covered before the photocopy was given to us.

833
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,310
But it may be a mistake by the prosecutor. I saw the address.

834
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,730
So that's it

835
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:40,030
What I have before you is Mr. Jin Chengguo's complaint.

836
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:42,110
and a copy of your resident registration form

837
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,040
I don't think it's because you are visually impaired

838
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,960
It is impossible to beat Mr. Jin Chengguo

839
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,340
If you can't see, you can't commit violence? That might be a prejudice.

840
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,220
This doesn't seem like something my lawyer would say.

841
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,390
The fact that you two lived at the same address

842
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,600
I thought for a long time how to explain

843
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,520
(257, Gil-eum-ro 8-lan, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul)

844
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,020
(257, Gil-eum-ro 8-lan, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul)

845
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,160
The idea that the two are just roommates

846
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,080
It could also be a prejudice.

847
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,370
Is it cold? Yes, the traffic is very serious.

848
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,630
Wait, what does this smell like? I made something delicious.

849
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,460
We used to live together but now we live separately

850
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,300
Even if this problem occurs, they still hide their relationship

851
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,720
Spoon

852
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,720
The two of them were in a relationship but broke up

853
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,430
The most natural explanation

854
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,270
Yes, we dated.

855
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,820
Now we are indeed separated

856
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,610
I didn't mean to hide it. Sorry.

857
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,110
No, you concealed it on purpose.

858
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:08,660
If the relationship is one that has ended, then the motive for violence is sufficient.

859
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,700
Did you hit him because he broke up with you?

860
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,790
I didn't hit him!

861
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,420
It was because I broke up that Chengguo did this.

862
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,050
Let me make this clearer.

863
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:29,720
Because I asked him to pay back the money I borrowed from him during our relationship.

864
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,180
That's how things turn out.

865
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,430
But I guess you didn't write a promissory note.

866
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,480
I didn't intend to ask him to pay it back when I lent him the money

867
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,070
Because I live in Chengguo, I can just treat the money I borrowed from him as rent.

868
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,480
But from a certain point on, the amount started to grow

869
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,900
Why do I have to pay you back that money?

870
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,360
If you continue like this, this is the only thing I can do.

871
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,240
The content has become more real

872
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,120
Quite reasonable and well motivated

873
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,290
That really happened and I have the account details.

874
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:58,920
If it's true

875
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,290
You'll say it at the beginning

876
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,600
Then we have to make it public that we are gay.

877
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,900
I'm out but Seungkook isn't

878
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,040
Did you confess directly because you felt sorry for Mr. Kim Seung-guk?

879
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,960
That's right.

880
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,340
But you appealed?

881
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,970
If you don't appeal, it's just like you said.

882
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,220
The case will end with a stay of sentencing.

883
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,100
There is no need to disclose Mr. Kim Seung-guk's sexual orientation

884
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,640
I'm curious as to why you changed your mind.

885
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,950
Even if the judgment is only postponed, your tax accountant license will be revoked according to the Tax Accountant Law, right?

886
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,740
Yeah, but that’s…

887
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:16,540
You may feel that losing your tax accountant license to protect him is too high a price to pay.

888
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,250
Or even if you did hit him

889
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:22,170
But still can't afford to have their tax accountant license revoked

890
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,630
It must be one of the two.

891
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,970
I wanted to forgive him one last time.

892
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,470
But the price of forgiving him is too high.

893
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,230
I can't bear to have my license revoked.

894
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:42,100
Sorry lawyer

895
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,480
I said the reason I appealed

896
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:52,360
Just to reveal the truth this statement is a bit exaggerated

897
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:57,660
It's not an exaggeration

898
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,580
It's a lie

899
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,000
Although I don't know where to start the lie

900
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,340
Lawyer An

901
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,300
You should go to court.

902
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,430
Get up

903
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,360
You confessed everything at the first trial.

904
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,700
Now he's appealing his innocence?

905
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,700
Right, lawyer?

906
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,820
That's right

907
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,580
Really? I understand. Please state the reasons for your appeal.

908
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,580
If based on the facts of the public prosecution and the facts confessed in the original trial

909
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,790
This case is about the defendant, who is a tax accountant, and the victim, who is a client.

910
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,670
Injury case caused by dispute over handling fee

911
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,090
However, this is not true

912
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,260
The two parties have never had a dispute over the handling fee

913
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,850
The defendant did not commit violence or harm the victim.

914
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,640
Therefore, the original judgment was illegal due to the factual errors.

915
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,520
(Dock)

916
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,110
This means that the defendant admitted all the facts of the prosecution at the first instance.

917
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:12,320
Now the truth is completely different?

918
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,650
The defendant wanted to avoid making things worse.

919
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,570
So I admitted all the charges.

920
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,080
But he's now appealing in the hope of uncovering the truth

921
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,700
I understand. Prosecutor, please state your opinion.

922
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,750
Please dismiss the defendant's appeal

923
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,460
Okay, then conduct an evidence investigation.

924
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,300
Shouldn't both parties have any special opinions on the evidence in the first trial?

925
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,600
According to the victim's statement, the defendant

926
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,360
Suddenly started throwing things around

927
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,940
Why do you keep playing tricks on me? Why?

928
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,860
You want to beat someone up for money?

929
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:58,570
You wanna hit me?

930
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,450
Stop talking nonsense!

931
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:08,290
This thing is called a laptop for the visually impaired

932
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,710
More precisely, it is a braille display machine.

933
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:13,550
It is not only a high-priced item with a price tag of over 6 million won

934
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:18,340
Without it, the defendant, who is visually impaired, would not only encounter many inconveniences in life

935
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,510
There are also great obstacles when working as a tax accountant

936
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,430
Therefore, the defendant had no reason to throw it out personally.

937
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,980
You can't do this to me!

938
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,270
Hello

939
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:33,070
Kim Seung Guk!

940
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,990
(Disease name: Blindness of both eyes)

941
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,870
The defendant is a visually impaired person who cannot even perceive light

942
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,950
The restroom is here, please.

943
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,540
Such a defendant cannot be accurately shot.

944
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,790
The victim's hand holding the microphone

945
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,130
In addition, unless it is not affected by gravity

946
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,550
It is impossible to make the microphone go away just by hitting the hand holding it.

947
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:01,220
Fly to the mirror on the screen

948
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,770
Hello

949
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,310
He grabbed the microphone and threw it away! My testimony was wrong.

950
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,110
Are you the victim?

951
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,610
Mr. Kim Seung-guk?

952
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:17,780
That's right.

953
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,200
You will be able to speak in a moment. Please keep quiet.

954
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,570
If you do this again, I will throw you out of court.

955
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,660
Lawyer, please continue.

956
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,670
This is the defendant's previous home address.

957
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:40,800
However, this address is the same as the victim's home address.

958
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,470
The accused and the victim...

959
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,480
More than just a simple tax accountant-client relationship

960
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,890
No... please sit down

961
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,100
No! Wait! Please sit down.

962
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,860
Wait, please calm down.

963
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,530
Mr. Jin Chengguo, this is your last warning.

964
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,200
They are both...

965
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,580
A close friendship where you can even live together

966
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:26,890
The defendant lent money to the victim numerous times while living with him.

967
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:30,060
The total amount is over 80 million won, which is a lot of money.

968
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,770
The core of the case is money after all

969
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,650
The problem is not the fees but the large loans

970
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,980
Why do I have to pay you back that money?

971
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,480
If you continue like this...

972
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,860
The victim who refused to pay the money back after being asked by the defendant

973
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:45,450
Decided to pretend to be assaulted

974
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:46,870
Start recording

975
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,740
You want to beat someone up for money?

976
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,240
You wanna hit me?

977
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:52,790
Don't move!

978
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,800
Why on earth would you do this?

979
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,220
stop!

980
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,890
Help…

981
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:13,680
However, due to the original trial

982
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:16,150
The defendant admitted to injuring the victim

983
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:18,770
Illegal acts that lead to errors in fact finding

984
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,730
Therefore, we request to revoke the original judgment.

985
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,030
Change the defendant's verdict to not guilty

986
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,530
Mr. Kim Seung-guk

987
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,330
You can speak now. Do you have anything to say?

988
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,210
No

989
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,820
Then I'll leave

990
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:13,160
Thank you for believing me.

991
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,380
I never believed you

992
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,960
I am simply creating the most favorable facts for you from the available evidence.

993
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:28,680
But what you revealed...

994
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,930
Who knows the truth?

995
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,850
Did I reveal the truth or create a fake lie?

996
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,140
That only you know

997
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,730
in addition…

998
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:47,150
Thank you for your understanding, Chengguo

999
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,530
Because even if I don't say it, I can still defend myself

1000
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,490
My work is over here

1001
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,700
The decision is yours.

1002
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,960
So we won't go to the verdict.

1003
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,250
I'm leaving.

1004
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,120
(Main text reason)

1005
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,130
Oh my god

1006
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,430
(Confirm the facts before next week)

1007
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,310
(Special handover matters)

1008
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,990
It’s a small world

1009
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,080
(Ask lawyer An Zhouheng about difficult cases)

1010
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,090
You've become a good lawyer.

1011
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,940
Let's go! Move!

1012
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,150
Scare me, knock on the door.

1013
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,190
Let's go! Move!

1014
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,570
Wait a minute, let me dry my hair first

1015
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:58,450
Hurry up! Your hair will dry quickly if you leave it alone!

1016
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,240
It's winter now and I'll catch a cold

1017
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,250
Do they have no concept of time or no concept at all?

1018
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:06,170
Us? You guys are here

1019
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:07,710
What?

1020
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:09,880
What's going on?

1021
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,050
What about the newcomers?

1022
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,670
She said she had some stuff to sort out so she would go straight over.

1023
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,800
Yeah?

1024
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,430
What's your expression? Are you hungry?

1025
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,560
No, hurry up. Zhou Heng is hungry.

1026
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,730
I said no, I walked fast without you telling me.

1027
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,650
Are you hungry? I said no.

1028
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:37,570
it's beautiful

1029
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:43,290
Please give us three beers and a roast chicken

1030
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,410
And a side of sausage and chips

1031
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,210
You said you were hungry, give us a sausage pizza too.

1032
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,880
Good thing I'm hungry.

1033
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:52,670
He came very quickly.

1034
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,590
Another beer please. Another beer here.

1035
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:58,590
hey-hey

1036
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,050
You haven't even started yet. We just arrived.

1037
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,180
Why do we need to order three side dishes?

1038
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,640
You'll finish it anyway, right?

1039
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,180
You don't order what I want to eat.

1040
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,230
We can just order two dishes with beer.

1041
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,400
Getting into a fight so soon?

1042
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,060
Waste of money... Thanks

1043
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,900
I really don't understand Pei Wenting

1044
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:17,780
Cheers

1045
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,530
Cheers! Cheers!

1046
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,700
cheers!

1047
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,040
What's wrong with him?

1048
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,130
He said he was hungry

1049
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,760
So that's it

1050
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,710
Get rid of it!

1051
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,930
It should be her, right?

1052
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,690
Over here!

1053
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,160
etc.

1056

We have been together

1057
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,530
Hong Kong? Oh my god.

1058
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:51,330
Do you know me? He doesn't remember me?

1059
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:55,910
This is similar to my case. I didn't pay the money back so I went to the other party's house.

1060
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,080
I feel uncomfortable after watching this, okay?

1061
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:01,670
It's completely different. I'm only responsible for the lawsuit and I won't pursue the person at home.

1062
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,340
Are you still a lawyer?

Are you interested in merging? You think I'm a bad guy?

1065
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,720
Don't understand why I took this case?

1066
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,890
You should at least feel uncomfortable, right? That's enough.

1067
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:16,770
What does she know? Is he crazy or evil?
