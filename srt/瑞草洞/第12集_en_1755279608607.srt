2
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,700
You haven't eaten, right?

3
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,480
Hey! Bring some food here, too.

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,180
Okay.

5
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,500
Did he have an existing condition?

6
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,740
No.

7
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,500
He was so healthy.

8
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I didn't think he'd suddenly pass like this.

9
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,330
Have some.

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,090
He had a big family.

11
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,580
No, they're all village residents.

12
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,050
He has a son, but he's in the US.

13
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,210
Until he arrives,

14
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,620
everyone is claiming to be the chief mourner now.

15
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,830
Did the village residents prepare all this?

16
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,580
Yes.

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,810
There's no one in our village who hasn't received his help.

18
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,930
Even though it didn't concern him,

19
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,870
he was so diligent and worked so hard to care for everyone.

20
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,490
If it weren't for him,

21
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,750
I would've never tried to get back the family land.

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,410
I don't know where it starts or ends.

23
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,480
The stolen land is a lot larger than you think.

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,650
Pardon?

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,530
I found the cadastral map from the Japanese colonial period.

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,380
Mr. Han In Su owned the land beyond the stream.

27
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,840
The land back there was ours, too?

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,230
Yes.

29
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,090
But what's the point?

30
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,030
Mr. Park is gone now.

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,790
No one would volunteer to help us.

32
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,550
Please enjoy your meal before you go.

33
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,540
Thank you so much for hearing Mr. Park out.

34
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,260
He must've been an amazing person.

35
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,550
I quit.

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,590
Find another associate attorney.

37
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,240
What are you doing right now, Attorney Jo?

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,320
It's exactly as I said just now.

39
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,640
Fine. Forget about Director Jang's case.

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,130
No.

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,980
It's not just about this case.

42
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,970
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

43
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,340
I...

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,780
can't work here any longer.

45
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,130
What are you doing out of the blue?

46
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,570
Do you think work is child's play?

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Well...

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,680
You can't suddenly do this.

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,030
There's a notice period when you quit.

50
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,750
We have to hire a replacement, do a handover,

51
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,040
and take legal steps—

52
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,490
Were there legal steps when I joined?

53
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,340
You didn't even give me an employment contract.

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,940
So, you were upset about that. Gosh.

55
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,670
Yes. Let's talk it out since we're attorneys.

56
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,480
Have a seat there.

57
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,350
Okay, then.

58
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,940
Work only until I hire someone new, then.

59
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,740
I don't want to.

60
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,700
I didn't know you were so firm, Attorney Jo.

61
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,830
If so...

62
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,540
Give me just 10 days.

63
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,500
- A week.
- Okay. A week. Thank you.

64
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,180
You must've been through a lot, Attorney Ha.

65
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm sure Ms. Kim didn't give you that case

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,540
just so you can get him a lesser sentence through extenuation.

67
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,230
She must care since he's her foundation's scholarship student.

68
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,980
Are you attending today, too?

69
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,880
I want to take the class, too.

70
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,330
Is that okay?

71
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,810
Are you getting a doctoral degree?

72
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,250
Oh, this? No, I'm not.

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,200
I recommend it. Highly recommend it.

74
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,920
Attorney Ha, fighting.

75
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,410
­

76
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,300
Yes.

77
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,410
Oh, Attorney Ha.

78
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,730
Ms. Kim.

79
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,320
Have a seat here.

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,120
Okay.

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,880
What brings you here?

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
Well...

83
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,350
The foundation you run...

84
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,850
is called "Seed Foundation," right?

85
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,700
Yes, that's right.

86
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,230
How did you hear about it?

87
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,510
It looks like you didn't just hear about it.

88
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,750
Well...

89
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,690
Thanks to you, without taking a leave of absence,

90
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,490
I was able to graduate from law school.

91
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,020
I think that was my first time

92
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,090
I was able to focus on my studies only.

93
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,140
Thank you so much.

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,270
If it weren't for you,

95
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,620
I never would've dreamed of this.

96
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,970
It took me way too long to thank you since I didn't know.

97
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,270
Thank you so much.

98
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,940
Gosh, sit now. Sit.

99
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,380
I'm the one who is grateful to see you doing well.

100
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,410
Did you know?

101
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,500
Of course.

102
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,060
When I found out you were at a law firm in my building,

103
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,400
I was so thrilled.

104
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,460
You should've told me, then.

105
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,250
What would've been the point?

106
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,680
You don't have to know about me, anyway.

107
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,450
I thought I remembered everyone who helped me,

108
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,050
but it's embarrassing that I had no clue.

109
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,570
I have so many favors to return.

110
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,820
You don't have to return anything to me.

111
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,900
You'll be returning a favor by living well like you do now.

112
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,710
Right. And...

113
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,590
just like you helped me,

114
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,180
I'd like to help someone.

115
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,180
He grew up in an orphanage.

116
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,630
I want to give him money so he can go to college.

117
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,180
But I don't want him to know it's from me.

118
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,720
I want to support him through your foundation.

119
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
You knew someone like that?

120
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,980
Our foundation will help him directly, then.

121
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,390
No. I want to help him.

122
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,620
And well, now...

123
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,210
I do have some money, Ms. Kim.

124
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,890
Actually...

125
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,260
I didn't know why I've been saving so desperately.

126
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,920
I want to spend it well now.

127
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,620
Okay. Let's do that.

128
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,910
It's hot in here.

129
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,290
Let's forget about that case.

130
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,950
I saw the summary.

131
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,890
If we do all this,

132
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,210
I'd owe the court quite a lot in the civil lawsuit and delivery fees.

133
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,220
This is for the better.

134
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,890
Mr. Park is gone, but we still have our clients.

135
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,150
We can definitely proceed.

136
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,140
You said there would be a lot of plaintiffs and defendants.

137
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,840
It'd get too complicated, and it'd take too long.

138
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,530
It'd take several years to finish.

139
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,980
We shouldn't take it. Just forget about it.

140
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,950
All right.

141
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,970
I knew you'd say that.

142
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,440
Do you only do what benefits you?

143
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,410
Who else would do this but me?

144
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,690
I'm doing it because someone needs to.

145
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,600
Since the burden of proof is on the plaintiff,

146
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,440
they need to overcome reasonable doubt,

147
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,540
but they aren't able to do that.

148
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,510
Please dismiss the plaintiff's complaint.

149
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,900
You didn't use to feel uncomfortable with stuff like this.

150
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,450
I was never uncomfortable.

151
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,100
I was just used to feeling uncomfortable.

152
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,220
Attorney An, should I put away the cadastral map in the conference room?

153
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,540
Don't put it away. Bring it to my office.

154
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,140
Okay, got it.

155
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,730
And...

156
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,840
please bring me Ms. Shin's files from the Deus GA case, too.

157
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
Okay.

158
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,250
­

159
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,200
Let's go.

160
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,950
Let's start with the case with a ruling.

161
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,830
2025-Gohap-7430.

162
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,260
A murder case.

163
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,470
Defendant Jeong Sun Ja.

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,310
Mom...

165
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,010
Here's the ruling.

166
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,500
Ruling summary.

167
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,780
Defendant Jeong Sun Ja is sentenced to three years in jail.

168
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,760
However,

169
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,170
starting on the ruling date,

170
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,870
she will be on probation for five years.

171
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,970
Thank you...

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,170
for hearing me out, Attorney.

173
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,390
I decided to quit my job.

174
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,860
I applied to become a career prosecutor.

175
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,870
I'll prepare for the exam.

176
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,510
- Prosecutor?
- Yes.

177
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,860
You hate prosecutors. Why all of a sudden?

178
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,890
That's why I want to try.

179
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,020
I won't become a prosecutor like that.

180
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,380
How long have you been thinking about this?

181
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,260
It hasn't been that long.

182
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,680
But I couldn't do this job once I started thinking about it.

183
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,470
I think you'd be good. It suits you.

184
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,270
Thank you. You're the best.

185
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,110
Why aren't you guys saying anything? Huh?

186
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,310
Are you disappointed?

187
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,640
- Prosecutor Jo Chang Won doesn't sound great.
- I know.

188
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,210
It'd be annoying to meet him in a trial, right?

189
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,150
Didn't your partner say anything?

190
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,040
He yelled at me when I quit, too.

191
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,240
So what if he did? I'm quitting.

192
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,840
Until when will you be working there, then?

193
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,830
Until this week.

194
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,680
- So soon?
- Yeah.

195
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,450
Worked out that way.

196
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,170
I applied to the doctoral program, too.

197
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,930
- You ended up applying.
- Yes.

198
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,850
Did you want to become a professor?

199
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,680
Yes.

200
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,800
You worked hard on teaching the interns. It must've suited you well.

201
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,270
- What about your job, then?
- Well,

202
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,450
I won't be able to keep it.

203
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,730
You're quitting, too?

204
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,370
My professor said he won't hire me if I keep working

205
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,830
while in the program.

206
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,000
I have an interview tomorrow, too.

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,150
What interview?

208
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,340
An in-house attorney position opened up.

209
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,870
I'll switch jobs if I get it.

210
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,440
When I think about having the baby,

211
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,600
I don't think I can continue to work here.

212
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,660
You didn't get maternity leave, did you?

213
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,510
That's one reason.

214
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,650
And the company will provide better welfare after giving birth, too.

215
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,330
I'll be working late a lot less, too.

216
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,610
You struggle to work in organizations.

217
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,530
Isn't that why you came here?

218
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,580
It's better that I endure the stress.

219
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,760
But it's incredibly competitive.

220
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,680
I won't be able to work there if I don't make it.

221
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,530
I'll just quit, then.

222
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,900
This is no good.

223
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,290
Ma'am, we'll have a bottle of soju.

224
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,970
Okay.

225
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,480
Everyone must've had a lot of concerns.

226
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,900
To be honest, there's something I couldn't bring up earlier.

227
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,600
What is it?

228
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,870
I'm thinking of doing public defense cases full-time.

229
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,320
Full-time?

230
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,460
I had a thought while working on Ms. Jeong's case.

231
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,860
If she had no one to listen to her,

232
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,500
she could've gotten a heavier punishment.

233
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,020
If it weren't for a public defender,

234
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,610
she wouldn't have had a chance to tell anyone.

235
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,200
Not all public defense cases are like that.

236
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,700
A lot of them are awful, vicious criminals.

237
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,070
I know. There will be people like that, too.

238
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,600
But I want to work for people like Ms. Jeong.

239
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,540
But that's possible only through public defense.

240
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,280
It might be much harder than you think.

241
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,660
Because you're devoted to your clients,

242
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,520
you'll also treat the unforgivable people the same.

243
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,450
I'm worried it'd be too hard on you.

244
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,220
I actually have something to say, too.

245
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,930
Ms. Bae Mun Jeong?

246
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,860
Yes.

247
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,110
Please come this way.

248
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,670
Okay.

249
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,550
You worked for a public office,

250
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,620
a company in-house attorney for a few years...

251
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,700
- A litigation attorney for quite a bit, too.
- Yes, that's correct.

252
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,160
Why did you work as a litigation attorney?

253
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,360
I wanted to meet the clients in person

254
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,970
and experience many trials, too.

255
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,410
Why are you trying to become an in-house attorney, then?

256
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,870
Once I worked as a litigation attorney,

257
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,400
I realized that working for a company is what suits me best.

258
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,150
I want to get back to it and do well.

259
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,190
Law Group Hyungmin.

260
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,880
I guess it wasn't a big firm.

261
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,320
You must've suffered a lot, then.

262
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,600
You probably had to deal with people in person.

263
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,450
I'm sorry, I'm a little late.

264
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,770
I'm Attorney Bae Mun Jeong of Law Group Hyungmin.

265
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:56,100
Attorney, please take care of the rest of the trial.

266
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,730
Let's reclaim that joy.

267
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,840
Dealing with people is pretty tough.

268
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,220
Yes, it is.

269
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,160
There will be none of that here.

270
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,870
You won't work outside or take on a new job often.

271
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,360
You just need to follow the routine and get along with us.

272
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,230
Okay. That sounds great.

273
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,580
We want someone to work with us for a long time.

274
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,700
Yes. I'm looking for a long-term job, too.

275
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,790
Sounds good.

276
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,440
Is there something you'd like to say before we finish?

277
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,820
No.

278
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,420
I don't think you need to contact me.

279
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,690
- Pardon?
- To be honest,

280
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,360
I like being a litigation attorney.

281
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,640
I like meeting people,

282
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,210
and I like attending trials.

283
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,110
I love taking on new cases, too.

284
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,150
I think that's more important to me.

285
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,860
You made time for me. I'm so sorry.

286
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,350
What?

287
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,500
How did it go?

288
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,300
- How did what go?
- The interview.

289
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,710
I won't work there.

290
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,240
What?

291
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,170
I said I won't work there.

292
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,090
I thought so.

293
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,860
Great. I'm glad you're doing this.

294
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,500
Why are you happy? Did you want me to not go there?

295
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,470
Yeah. That's not the type of work you want to do.

296
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,160
You're right.

297
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,180
- Did I really do the right thing?
- Yes.

298
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,190
You really, really did.

299
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,190
I'm so proud of you.

300
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,950
Let's eat.

301
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,280
- Water.
- I'll get you water.

302
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,000
Here's water.

303
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,620
A-Are you crying?

304
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,830
Thank you.

305
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,950
What?

306
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,750
Thank you.

307
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,090
You're ugly, Bae Mun Jeong.

308
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,980
Thank you.

309
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,910
You wanted to eat. Why are you crying?

310
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,530
Let's eat. These are all your favorites, right?

311
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,220
Yeah.

312
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,830
- Hello.
- Hello.

313
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

314
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,040
Hello.

315
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,350
- Hello.
- You came.

316
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,690
Delivery checklist.

317
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,140
Drool rash cream?

318
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,730
Temp for maternity leave?

319
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,150
How many cases are you handling right now?

320
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,790
And it's not easy to hire a temporary attorney for just three or six months.

321
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,790
Not that I want to, either.

322
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,370
I'm a new attorney mom who's on

323
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,650
a break caring for a 6-month-old.

324
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,900
My husband will be on paternity leave for a year after six months.

325
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,640
So, I'm looking for a place to work for a year.

326
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,050
It's hard to find a job that works with my timing.

327
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,990
Are there any moms in this field?

328
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,040
I've worked as an attorney at a law firm,

329
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,520
but I'm taking a break after childbirth.

330
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,050
I'm working as a maternity leave temp right now.

331
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,710
The contract ends when the child joins a daycare.

332
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,020
I think my child can adjust smoothly.

333
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,600
How many days do kids usually take to adjust?

334
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,540
I already forgot about the difficulties with the first child.

335
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,620
I can't believe I'm planning for the second one.

336
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,830
Thankfully, the results are good.

337
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's collect the eggs in two weeks.

338
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,400
I want to be back in just a year.

339
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,170
I worry if I can find a workplace

340
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,870
when my child is ready for school.

341
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,150
But it'll work out, right?

342
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,250
Is there an attorney who's looking for a temp during maternity leave?

343
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,320
Hello. I'm an associate attorney

344
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,440
who's looking for a maternity leave temp before childbirth.

345
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,380
Mr. Kwon Guk Jin, correct?

346
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,480
Yes, that's me.

347
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,120
Don't be so nervous. What brings you here?

348
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:19,660
Our new employee reported me for sexual assault.

349
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,540
Could you explain what happened?

350
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,460
Well, when a new employee joined,

351
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,490
we threw her a welcome party.

352
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,930
She ended up sitting next to me.

353
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,490
And...

354
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,090
she reported me for touching her thigh under the table.

355
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,600
Did your hand touch her thigh accidentally?

356
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,520
No, it wasn't an accident.

357
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,150
I just touched her.

358
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,300
Pardon?

359
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,970
It wasn't a mistake. I touched her.

360
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,100
Are you admitting to the charge, then?

361
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,920
Yes. It's true I did that.

362
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,380
You must be looking to lessen the sentence, then.

363
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,380
Is this your first offense?

364
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,910
First offense?

365
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,660
Are you asking if this is my first time touching someone

366
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,380
or if I've been caught and punished before?

367
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,400
I've never been caught and punished.

368
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,970
There's no CCTV, and since it was under the table,

369
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,540
no one could see it.

370
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,080
I'm looking to get acquitted this time, too.

371
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,750
You can help me, right?

372
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,320
I've never been caught. If I got caught this time,

373
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,520
it'd be kind of weird.

374
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,170
Hello?

375
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,100
Were you passing by my office by chance?

376
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,450
Yes, that's right.

377
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,350
How did you come just in time?

378
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,120
What do you mean?

379
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,830
It's nothing.

380
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,290
What is it? Tell me.

381
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,180
Are you worried about something?

382
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,020
There's a job called a public defender.

383
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,340
The court hires them.

384
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,530
They only do public defense cases

385
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,780
to help people who can't afford an attorney.

386
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,680
Hey, I know what a public defender is.

387
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,330
You want to do that?

388
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,150
Yes.

389
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,170
But I'm wondering if I'm being too idealistic.

390
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,440
I see.

391
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,270
Do you have to do it?

392
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,270
I hope you didn't do it.

393
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,090
Why?

394
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,800
I don't want you to only work with problematic people.

395
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,140
You've been framed once, too.

396
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,040
There might be people like that, too.

397
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,400
Of course, there can be.

398
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,460
I'm not sure if I'm being selfish,

399
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,170
but I don't want you to do work like that.

400
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,670
Do you think so, too?

401
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,310
Did someone else say that?

402
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,020
Yes.

403
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,030
Attorney Jo, I'll come in.

404
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,910
Okay. Come in.

405
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,860
Well, what's this?

406
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,380
Mr. Seong wants you to write defense summaries for these cases.

407
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,470
All of these?

408
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,210
Yes.

409
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,570
Okay, got it.

410
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,730
You received the case files, right?

411
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,370
You can do it, right? You have plenty of time.

412
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,270
Yes, I can do it.

413
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,000
Whoa, Attorney Jo is so determined. Seriously.

414
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,090
Gosh, there's so much to do.

415
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,520
And regarding the unjust profit return...

416
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,260
Yes.

417
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,800
Let's make a decision today.

418
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,380
Whether I'll leave or you'll follow the law.

419
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,470
What's this?

420
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,960
They're resumes for the temp position

421
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,800
that you didn't bother looking for.

422
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,180
I've done this a few times, but—

423
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,740
You never have. I'm sure they all just quit.

424
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,460
But I can't quit. I mean, I won't.

425
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,310
It's my right. Why should I?

426
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,350
But realistically—

427
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,480
Be realistic and pick among these.

428
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,250
They want to fill my position according to the labor law.

429
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,950
Good, right?

430
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,710
I'll leave, then.

431
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,830
Geez. What's wrong with her?

432
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,150
I'm looking to get acquitted this time, too.

433
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,760
I've never been caught. If I got caught this time,

434
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,720
it'd be kind of weird.

435
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,950
Thank you...

436
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,920
for hearing me out, Attorney.

437
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,920
Let's discuss the acknowledgment of the charge again.

438
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,420
Yes.

439
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,990
Yes, Attorney Ha.

440
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,410
Do you have plans this evening?

441
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,490
Well, no. Why?

442
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,770
Would you like to have dinner with me, then?

443
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,240
Okay.

444
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,730
I'll grab my stuff real quick, then.

445
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

446
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,260
- Try this, too.
- Eat, eat.

447
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,050
It's delicious.

448
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,610
By the way,

449
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,270
why did you suddenly suggest having dinner?

450
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,030
I didn't think we'd come to a place like this.

451
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,390
Well, I haven't eaten with you in a while.

452
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,300
I realized I never treated you.

453
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,260
Are you paying for this, then?

454
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,210
Of course.

455
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,870
Ms. Kim,

456
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:20,090
I decided to start the doctoral program.

457
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,810
Oh, really?

458
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,020
That's so great.

459
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,500
Will the school let you work while in the program?

460
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,080
No.

461
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,780
Huh? What will you do, then?

462
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,970
I think I'll have to quit my job.

463
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,870
Are you announcing your resignation, then?

464
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,240
Yes.

465
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,100
I feel like I'm being dumped. Was this...

466
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,880
a farewell meal?

467
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,810
Well,

468
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,750
not exactly.

469
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,360
It worked out that way. I'm sorry.

470
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,550
This isn't a proper sendoff.

471
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,730
You're free after this, right?

472
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,560
Let's go and get a drink.

473
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,390
Well, okay.

474
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,030
Wait...

475
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,740
I mean...

476
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,660
This is expensive stuff.

477
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,380
Wait, Ms. Kim...

478
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,110
Yes.

479
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,870
What brings you here, Chief?

480
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,800
Director, they're conducting a tax audit of the foundation.

481
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,530
Why all of a sudden?

482
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,350
They received a petition.

483
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,250
I think they'll be here soon, too.

484
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,600
Petition? From whom?

485
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,610
Should I give him all of this?

486
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,030
Give me everything from last year to today.

487
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,880
This is Seong Yu Deok.

488
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,340
I have a question.

489
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,480
- Take all of these.
- As for the rest...

490
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,580
It's in here.

491
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,160
Okay.

492
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,940
Put the rest of those in.

493
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,470
These are from before the merger.

494
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,910
Put them in for now.

495
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,880
Let him have them.

496
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,280
What are you investigating, exactly?

497
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,910
I'm checking if the Seed Foundation's money was

498
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,300
sent here as legal fees.

499
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,560
If we suspect other crimes like embezzlement

500
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,110
and breach of the Attorney-at-Law Act,

501
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,200
we'll report you.

502
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,230
They found it suspicious that our law firm keeps receiving money

503
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,320
as legal fees.

504
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,780
That's what the petition was about.

505
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,100
They're saying you control both companies.

506
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,030
What's going on right now?

507
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,220
Because we took legal fees from you,

508
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,680
we're in the hot seat right now.

509
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,190
Who's Lee Dong Su?

510
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,930
- Lee Dong Su?
- Yes.

511
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,550
Mr. Seong looked into it.

512
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,950
They're doing this because of the petition he submitted.

513
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,640
Are you confused because you have an office

514
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,670
at a law firm?

515
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:57,490
This is nothing. Please calm down first.

516
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,980
We did nothing wrong—

517
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,120
What's your purpose?

518
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,470
For what purpose did you merge?

519
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,940
Did you merge to pocket the money from the foundation?

520
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,910
At first, it seemed to help

521
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,920
but we ended up on the same case on opposing sides.

522
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,010
The associate attorneys formed a clique to hang out.

523
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,010
All the associate attorneys became weird after the merger.

524
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,710
There won't be any issues with the investigation.

525
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,510
You received the fees when the foundation brought a case,

526
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,120
it won't be an issue.

527
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,010
But right now,

528
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,130
the investigation isn't the only issue for you all. Right?

529
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,940
How long have you worked at our firm?

530
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,320
It's been about three and a half years.

531
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,310
You were here for a long time.

532
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,750
I've always been curious about something.

533
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,810
Okay.

534
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,330
Why did you come to our firm after working

535
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,060
for the firm downstairs?

536
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,420
Because you offered a bigger salary.

537
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,070
Is that really the only reason?

538
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,870
Yes.

539
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,950
You're such an interesting person.

540
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,790
Moving from downstairs to upstairs

541
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,810
will have you keep running into Mr. Seong.

542
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,120
It must be awkward.

543
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,240
Why did you hire someone from downstairs, then?

544
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,830
You felt uncomfortable, too.

545
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,810
Because I liked you.

546
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,970
I could tell you wouldn't do anything funny.

547
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,710
I thought we'd be on the same wavelength, too.

548
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,740
Since when did you think that?

549
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,730
Since the interview.

550
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,380
We never really talked to each other since then.

551
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,520
I see. The interview.

552
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,030
Yes.

553
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,820
The interview. What did you think?

554
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,370
I didn't think anything.

555
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,810
What did you think?

556
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,320
I didn't think anything.

557
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,040
What is there to think about?

558
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,050
Of course, it was the interview.

559
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,850
To be honest,

560
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,700
I suggested sponsoring you

561
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,630
for the doctoral degree, to make you stay a long time.

562
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,350
I really had no idea, Ms. Kim.

563
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:08,190
But you're about to leave because of my suggestion.

564
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,120
What a shame.

565
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,880
Ms. Kim,

566
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,930
thank you for everything.

567
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,300
I learned a lot from you.

568
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,700
Gosh, that's enough.

569
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,380
Let's just drink. Learn what?

570
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,700
Are we drinking all this at once?

571
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,480
- Drink at your own pace.
- It's too strong.

572
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,450
This is how I drink.

573
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,180
Well...

574
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,860
Take your time.

575
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,730
You look very tired.

576
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,760
Do you have a lot of trials tomorrow?

577
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,550
I have no trials tomorrow.

578
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,950
I'm still going to pursue becoming a public defender.

579
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,660
I know it's not easy.

580
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,970
As you said, it's so hard dealing with awful people.

581
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,980
I met one like that.

582
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,630
But still, I stuck it out until the end.

583
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,100
So, don't worry so much.

584
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,450
I know you can do well.

585
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,670
It's a very difficult job.

586
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,050
But I think you'll be best at it out of anyone I know.

587
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,910
Thank you.

588
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,700
- Ms. Kim?
- No.

589
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,420
Did you sleep well?

590
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,890
Yes. Gosh, I passed out.

591
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,820
I slept well.

592
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,690
Yes. Tell me what this is about.

593
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,560
I'll have to quit because there's something I want to try.

594
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,640
I'll apply to become a public defender.

595
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,650
I came here to tell you that.

596
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,230
Thank you for the great opportunity, Ms. Kang.

597
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,090
I suspected this.

598
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,380
I didn't think you'd become a public defender,

599
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,230
but I thought you'd want to do something like that.

600
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,760
I'm sorry I couldn't be more understanding.

601
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,600
Not at all. You've been so good to me.

602
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,980
How much longer will you work here, then?

603
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,270
I'll stay until you hire someone if you need me to.

604
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,070
I'll stay as long as possible.

605
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,840
Didn't you say you don't like staying and

606
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,470
getting paid while your heart has already left?

607
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,780
- Pardon?
- During your interview,

608
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,800
I asked you why you quit before you found a new job.

609
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,630
That was your answer then.

610
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,390
I liked your answer then.

611
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,070
I'll do my best before I leave, so it won't be a waste of salary.

612
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,980
I hired you because I liked your answer.

613
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,380
I can't tell you to do the opposite.

614
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,870
You need to study a lot for the public defender exam.

615
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,190
Study hard and make sure to pass.

616
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,860
I'll take care of things here.

617
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,940
It's sad, but let's call it quits now.

618
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,100
All right.

619
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,590
Thank you for everything, Ms. Kang.

620
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,630
Me, too.

621
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,400
I finished the appeal request for Taegwon Pipes.

622
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,900
The current status and transfer docs

623
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,500
for the 48 cases I've been on are

624
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,190
organized and saved on my desktop.

625
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,200
When you hire a new attorney, tell them to look at those.

626
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,480
Do you know an attorney you can recommend?

627
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,990
I'm having a hard time hiring.

628
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,550
Don't worry if you don't. I'll manage it.

629
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,640
Good work.

630
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,340
Let's say hello if we run into each other in court.

631
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,600
Yes. Thank you.

632
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,560
- Huh?
- Huh? What?

633
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,660
Huh? What?

634
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,690
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

635
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,990
I'll stop by the fourth floor.

636
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

637
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,960
You're quitting today, anyway.

638
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,050
Why do you suddenly ask for permission?

639
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,720
- Go.
- You go first.

640
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,980
Okay, I'll go.

641
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,460
I'll go this way.

642
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,730
Yun Su will think he's getting a scholarship

643
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,100
from our foundation through the orphanage.

644
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,570
Okay. Thank you.

645
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:38,080
Protecting someone's dream feels amazing.

646
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,710
Yes.

647
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,480
That's why I want to protect mine, too.

648
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,230
I didn't exactly want to become an attorney.

649
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,450
I think I wanted to study more.

650
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,770
The situation didn't let me study back then.

651
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,890
And I thought I'd make a lot of money as an attorney, too.

652
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,820
I didn't think I'd have time to have a dream,

653
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,930
but I have one.

654
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,570
I decided to...

655
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,740
apply for the doctoral program.

656
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,090
Really?

657
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,820
That's great. Congratulations.

658
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,740
I really wanted to let you know.

659
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,900
Thank you so much for letting me know.

660
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,590
Gosh, you're about to get even busier.

661
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,930
You have to study and work late.

662
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,160
Well, I'm quitting my job.

663
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,230
Since I found what I like,

664
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,100
I'll only focus on that.

665
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,140
- You're quitting?
- Yes.

666
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,860
Today is my last day.

667
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,010
Today is my last day, too.

668
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,810
What do you mean?

669
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,600
I'll quit being a legal advisor here.

670
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,630
I thought being in the Seocho neighborhood meant

671
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,430
I achieved my dream or something.

672
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,410
That's why I kept lingering around here.

673
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,710
I bought a building here and...

674
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:08,320
I only wanted to rent to attorneys, too.

675
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,870
But that doesn't bring any satisfaction.

676
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,600
I finally admitted it.

677
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,600
I will...

678
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,290
try becoming an attorney again.

679
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,140
Fighting!

680
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,100
You, too. Fighting!

681
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,700
I'll try to help you.

682
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,590
Sure thing.

683
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,210
I'm sorry for making you worry yesterday.

684
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:09,230
We didn't think it'd be an issue. It's okay.

685
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,590
If it did, it'd be your problem. Not ours.

686
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:19,050
Anyway, I'm worried about hiring a new associate attorney.

687
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,650
Did yours quit, too?

688
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,260
I have to hire someone new, too.

689
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,440
Well, me, too.

690
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,310
I'm not sure if I could hire someone as good as Attorney Kang.

691
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,240
Did everyone quit?

692
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,070
They were together all the time.

693
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,940
They're quitting together, too.

694
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,950
By the way, did Attorney Ha quit, too?

695
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,700
Did he find someone who pays more again?

696
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,700
No. It's not like that.

697
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,090
He's leaving to study. I suggested it.

698
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,020
Okay.

699
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,980
Are any of yours quitting?

700
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,950
I heard one of yours is pregnant.

701
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,780
Why should she quit? She can go on maternity leave.

702
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,910
I already found someone to substitute for her.

703
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,200
Why is yours quitting?

704
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,490
She wants to pursue something.

705
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:07,670
I know that associate attorneys quit eventually,

706
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,870
but we always feel sad.

707
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:15,160
They must feel sad, saying goodbye to each other, too.

708
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,260
It was nice to see them having fun together.

709
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,890
They helped me a lot, too.

710
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,330
I wanted to see you today to say goodbye, too.

711
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,420
Thanks to you,

712
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,930
I was able to live my dream briefly.

713
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,140
I couldn't have made this decision if it weren't for this experience.

714
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,100
Feel free to stay merged or go back to normal.

715
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,140
I'll assist you no matter what decision you make.

716
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,160
Are you going somewhere?

717
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,870
No. There's something I want to focus on.

718
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:15,110
I hope to see you again somewhere else.

719
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,750
Go ahead and finish your food.

720
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,600
Thank you.

721
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,370
I'll get going.

722
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,950
♫  That's not why I cried  ♫|

723
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:02,890
♫  It's just that everything felt so unfamiliar  ♫

724
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,280
♫  At the end of time that arrived before we knew it  ♫

725
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,600
♫  I catch my breath and get through the day  ♫

726
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:19,830
♫  Small but precious scenes of the street grow a bit wistful  ♫

727
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,660
Hi.

728
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:27,880
♫  To everything that scatters and disappear  ♫

729
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,640
♫  I give the names that have been forgotten  ♫

730
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,110
Don't come out. We'll go on our own.

731
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,140
You're all free now.

732
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,110
Studying at my age is tiring.

733
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,970
Don't go and stay in Seocho, then.

734
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:48,900
I'll visit often.

735
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,890
No one who says that ever does.

736
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,260
I have no choice but to visit often.

737
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,760
Gosh, how annoying.

738
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,040
You don't have to tell me when you come.

739
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,520
I'm not interested.

740
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,500
Okay.

741
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,870
- Shall we go?
- We'll go. Keep in touch.

742
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,440
I'll go.

743
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:18,900
♫  Hi, today is a good day for me  ♫

744
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,100
It's my hormones, okay?

745
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,920
Attorney An, Deus GA wants you for their appeal trial.

746
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,050
I suppose Ms. Shin appealed.

747
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,110
Since you did such a good job last time,

748
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,350
they want you again. Thanks in advance.

749
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:31,880
I won't take the Deus GA case.

750
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,400
What do you mean?

751
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,420
And I'll keep working on the Mr. Park case.

752
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,870
Excuse me?

753
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,080
What are you doing?

754
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,780
I said we should drop that case.

755
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,040
Yes.

756
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm not saying I'll work on it here.

757
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,750
Thank you for everything.

758
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,030
Are you saying you're quitting?

759
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,550
Yes.

760
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,830
I know you've been dissatisfied with me lately.

761
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:17,290
But I have a job

762
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,740
as the managing partner.

763
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,650
I know you understand that.

764
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,200
I don't think your approach is wrong.

765
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,440
Because I got used to it, I've worked for you for 10 years.

766
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,790
But now I feel uncomfortable because I'm used to it.

767
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:37,000
I'll try doing things my way.

768
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,400
- Do you mean you'll start your firm?
- Yes.

769
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,410
No matter how I tried to persuade you,

770
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,010
you won't change your mind.

771
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,440
Probably not.

772
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,510
Okay.

773
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,490
Fine.

774
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,470
Thank you for everything.

775
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,500
Thank you for everything.

776
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,530
Why did you want to see me?

777
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,010
I wanted to tell you something.

778
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,480
What is it?

779
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,050
Did the company tell you to deliver something to me again?

780
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,800
- It's not that—
- Let me ask you first, then.

781
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,790
Were you on Deus's side from the beginning?

782
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:55,080
Did you keep that a secret and pretend to listen to me?

783
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,540
I...

784
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:03,350
I trusted you and told you everything.

785
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,540
How could you be like that?

786
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,790
I'm sorry. It wasn't like that.

787
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,720
What was it, then?

788
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,770
What are you trying to tell me now?

789
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,750
I heard you're pursuing an appeal.

790
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,300
- Will you prevent me from doing that, too?
- No.

791
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:34,220
All insurance contracts are required to be signed up on the company system.

792
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,460
If they let people go home only after signing a contract, as you said,

793
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,040
many contracts must've been signed up late at night.

794
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,750
Some of them must've been under the salesperson's name.

795
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:51,170
You can prove their abuse if you submit that record.

796
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,310
Why are you suddenly doing this?

797
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,730
Because I want to correct things.

798
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,030
I'm very sorry about everything.

799
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:13,320
♫  I still remember standing there  ♫

800
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:19,080
♫  At the end of clumsy days  ♫

801
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,100
♫  But, slowly now, it feels like it's all right  ♫

802
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:34,930
♫  With a tired heart, I gave up  ♫

803
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,610
♫  Sometimes, it's nice that way  ♫

804
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,310
♫  And I can breathe again with your love  ♫

805
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:51,910
♫  Yes, a little bit closer  ♫

806

01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:04,840
♫  In the midst of your busy day  ♫

808
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,150
♫  Just smile and forget the pain  ♫

809
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:14,670
♫  Beautiful love again  ♫

810
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:19,020
♫  With your smile  ♫

811
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,550
Hold on, please.

812
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:17,000
Thank you.

813

­

814
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,880
Manager.

815
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,210
Gosh, Attorney Bae!

816
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,710
Long time no see.

817
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,500
Congratulations on your baby!

818
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,990
Thank you.

819
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,050
Attorney Bae.

820
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

821
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,700
Hello.

822
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,370
I haven't been outside for so long.

823
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,710
Hey, you came.

824
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,030
- Mr. Na.
- Is the baby doing well?

825
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,190
Have you been well?

826
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,950
Take care, then.

827
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:27,450
T-The baby's growing well...

828
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,320
He hasn't changed at all.

829
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,980
Yes.

830
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,870
Gosh. You came, Attorney Bae.

831
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,750
Long time no see. Have you been well?

832
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,790
Yes. You look amazing.

833
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:47,510
I don't. I'm about to die right now.

834
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,260
Wait for the miracle of the first birthday.

835
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,110
Things change after the first birthday.

836
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,920
Will the miracle really come?

837
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,710
Yes.

838
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,110
Anyway, I'm sorry.

839
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,000
I called you while you were on leave.

840
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,730
No. It's okay.

841
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,100
I live right nearby.

842
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,360
You're struggling with the Sumyeong ENC case?

843
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:10,420
Yes. You wrote a petition for the case.

844
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,750
But it's going differently than I expected.

845
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,580
Can I look at the record?

846
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,650
- It's this part.
- Oh, this part.

847
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,660
Where was it?

848
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,230
- This? This?
- Yes.

849
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,280
What time is the evening class rescheduled for?

850
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,720
I'm not a TA for that class, Professor.

851
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,500
- You weren't?
- No.

852
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,280
That thing. This thing.

853
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,230
Yes.

854
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:54,910
The law school class later... The contract law one.

855
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,810
Let them know I'll be five minutes late.

856
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,330
Okay, got it.

857
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:59,840
Hold on. Hold on...

858
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,480
- Kang Su Min.
- Yes.

859
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:07,990
- Kang Hyeok Chan.
- Yes.

01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,620
- Go Eun Ho.
- Yes.

861
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,830
Dong Hyo.

862
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,190
Yes.

863
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,390
- Min Ju.
- Yes.

864
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:16,270
- Seon Yeong.
- Yes.

865
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,690
- Kim Se In.
- Yes.

866
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,240
Kim Hyeong Min.

867
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,950
Yes.

868
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,140
- Na Jun Yeong.
- Yes.

869
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,150
- No Yun Seong.
- Yes.

870
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,330
- Nam Se Hun.
- Yes.

871
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,240
Mun Bo Ram.

872
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:44,400
Seriously. I told you to go without me.

873
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,140
Why? It's nice to walk together from here.

874
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,880
Isn't it hard having lunch here every day?

875
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,970
My boyfriend is a student.

876
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:58,630
I should feed him, at least.

877
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,550
Follow me.

878
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,670
I think you'll buy me something expensive today.

879
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,270
Huh? I'm not.

880
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,120
We're having tteokbokki.

881
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:11,010
­

882
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,140
Prosecutor, please request the sentence.

883
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,740
The defendant embezzled billions of the company's money,

884
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,000
but he continuously denied it.

885
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,060
In order to blame his employee for it,

886
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,320
he forced perjury on other employees.

887
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,630
He's not showing remorse at all.

888
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:03,150
His behavior is that of a heinous criminal.

889
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:04,390
As a harsh punishment,

890
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:08,200
I request a 15-year sentence.

891
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,180
Hello.

892
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:31,870
Here you go.

893
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:35,330
Attorney Kang, how many will you take today?

894
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,870
I have 17 today.

895
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,510
Drink water and wait over here.

896
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,570
Okay.

897
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,850
Don't worry, everyone. It will go well.

898
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:13,490
It will go well, ma'am. Yes.

899
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,980
Attorney An.

900
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,940
You're ready, right?

901
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,680
Yes.

902
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,240
Let's go.

903
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,070
Case Number 2026-Gahap-3784.

904
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,310
Plaintiff Han Su Cheol and the other 42.

905
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,950
Defendant Kwak Jeong Hyeon and the other nine.

906
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,810
Are you ready?

907
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,860
Yes.

908
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:45,510
Okay. Proxies, please come forward.

909
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,990
The other plaintiffs and defendants will stay in the audience.

910
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:56,670
We're starting a difficult case.

911
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,340
Who's the plaintiff's attorney?

912
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,640
Plaintiff Han Su Cheol and the other 42,

913
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,390
and their attorney, An Ju Hyeong, are present.

914
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,170
Let's go eat.

915
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,760
Was today's visit difficult, too?

916
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,870
I have a crazy jerk this time.

917
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,440
He's a total psycho.

918
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,000
How could someone be like that?

919
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,120
- You have a crazy jerk?
- Yeah.

920
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,750
Resign.

921
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,360
I can't. It's my job.

922
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,240
I'm a public servant.

923
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,760
Or join our firm.

924
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,710
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

925
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,350
You don't want to?

926
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:02,310
Everything changes, but not this.

927
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,140
This won't change.

928
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,090
Hello.

929
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,020
Can't you be more punctual?

930
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,870
I'm not even that late.

931
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,260
Something funny happened today. Want to hear about it?

932
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,740
Later. Later.

933
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,290
- You only poured yours.
- Hello.

934
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,870
Seriously.

935
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,780
You'll never change. You're so—

936
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,340
What time is it? What time is it?

937
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,470
Haven't you ordered yet?

938
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,320
Not everyone's here.

939
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,330
Is the baby doing well?

940
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:38,630
Here they are.

941
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:42,220
Do you not have a perception of time or perceptions in general?

942
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,240
It took 30 minutes for the defendant to come.

943
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,310
I met with 17 people in prison.

944
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,460
Hey, I came from Suwon.

945
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:50,040
I came out while caring for the baby, okay?

946
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,600
Let's order.

947
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,300
- Five bean sprout soups, please.
- Okay.

948

949
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,700
Let's meet halfway next time.

950
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,170
That's what I want to say.

951
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:15,900
But we've never eaten anywhere else, have we?

952
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,000
We've never been anywhere else.

953
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,800
Just come to Seocho. It's comfortable here.

954
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,340
Let's eat something fancier next time.

955
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,530
- Yes.
- Who suggested eating this today?

956
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,620
We need to get tonkatsu.

957
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,010
- Sang Ki.
- Yes?

958
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,840
Let's order bossam*.
(*Boiled pork shoulder; thinly sliced)

959
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,090
They have bossam?

960
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,570
Thank you for the meal, Oppa.

961
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:45,570
They have octopus bossam.
