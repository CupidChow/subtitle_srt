00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,100
-I think it's her.
-You're right.

4
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,860
Over here!

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Wait.

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,610
EMERGENCY ALERT

7
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,780
What? An earthquake?

8
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,200
Hi, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

9
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It's been a while.

10
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,090
Do you know me?

11
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,760
What?

12
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,300
EMERGENCY ALERT

13
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,480
Nice to meet you.

14
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,230
I'm Kim Hyungmin.

15
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,450
Don't you remember me?

16
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,620
You do look familiar.

17
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,040
You seemed shocked to know her.

18
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,840
No, the subtle tremors
were what startled me.

19
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,460
What? You felt that?

20
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,760
What are you, a seismometer? So lame.

21
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,930
Please take a seat.

22
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,930
-Okay.
-Why don't you sit here instead?

23
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,140
-Thank you.
-Sure.

24
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,810
Would you like a glass of beer?

25
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,390
Yes.

26
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,070
I was in Gwangseong Law School's
13th cohort.

27
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,400
What? Seriously?

28
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
-Ninth cohort? I saw it on the website.
-Yes.

29
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,780
I see! Nice to meet you.

30
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Thank you.

31
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,250
-Should we toast first?
-Great timing.

32
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,710
-Cheers.
-I'm all out.

33
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
You should've told us earlier then.

34
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,380
Have some of mine.

35
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,890
All right, then. Cheers!

36
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,310
-Cheers!
-Nice to meet you!

37
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,450
So, how do you know Juhyeong?

38
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,490
We were briefly together before.

39
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,620
-Here.
-Thank you.

40
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,750
You crazy bastard.
You forgot someone you dated?

41
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,750
What are you talking about?
We never dated.

42
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,420
When did I say we dated?
I said we were together.

43
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,800
We were both briefly in Hong Kong and met.

44
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,640
Gosh, you should've said that then.

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,680
He said he doesn't remember anyways.

46
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,020
Wait, Hong Kong?

47
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,390
When you went two years ago?

48
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,770
Honestly, if it was two years ago,
you should be able to remember that.

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,560
Someone this pretty
would be hard to forget.

50
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,980
Exactly.

51
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,780
This is the first time we've met.

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,120
I only saw your name
when I signed the lease agreement.

53
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,620
Right. I usually leave property matters
to the building manager.

54
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,710
I'm probably new to all of you,

55
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,960
but I've made sure to learn
who each of you are.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,250
So you all seem familiar.

57
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,010
Us?

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,130
You're the tenants in my building.

59
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,640
To me, you're my clients.

60
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,850
I think this is our first time
meeting like this as well.

61
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,480
Well, we've crossed paths before,
but we've never introduced ourselves.

62
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,070
We've introduced ourselves.
Right, Director Seong?

63
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,700
Yes, we have.

64
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,280
It was because of
Attorney Ha Sanggi, right?

65
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,660
He used to work for Mr. Seong.

66
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,080
And then, he switched
to Ms. Kim's firm upstairs.

67
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,000
That's right!

68
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,420
With someone as beautiful as her,

69
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,050
you should remember
if it was just two years ago.

70
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,380
-Wait, wasn't that around then?
-You're right.

71
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,470
What? What is it?

72
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,680
Well, the reason why
he went to Hong Kong was…

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,520
Hey, what was her name again?

74
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,730
The blind date.

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,110
Diamond Kim! Right?

76
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,780
-Thank you.
-Crystal Park. Park Sujeong.

77
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,570
Right. Crystal Park is his ex-girlfriend.

78
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,450
After they broke up, he was a mess.

79
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,580
We told him to take a trip
and he went there.

80
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,200
Her name was Sujeong,
so we nicknamed her Crystal Park.

81
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,040
How did he turn that into Diamond Kim?

82
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey! Diamond Kim, Crystal Park.
It's all the same in Korean.

83
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,260
They're totally different.
Crystal is <i>sujeong.</i>

84
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,010
And diamond is… What was it again?

85
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,390
-<i>Geum gangseok</i>.
-Thank you. Yeah, <i>geum gangseok</i>.

86
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,260
So you're saying Juhyeong's ex
was Kim Geum Gangseok?

87
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,770
I mean, Kim and <i>geum</i>
basically sound the same in Korean.

88
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,850
So it could've been Kim Gangseok.

89
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,100
Kim Gangseok?

90
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,480
What, did she sing
<i>A Letter from a Private?</i>

91
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,730
That's Kim Gwangseok.

92
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,320
I know that.

93
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,410
Did you just say her name
in front of my face?

94
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,000
Were we still
not supposed to say her name?

95
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,620
No, you said it wrong anyway,
so you're fine.

96
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,540
But seriously,
Diamond Kim was a bit ridiculous.

97
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,420
Right? Hey, Munjeong! I can't believe you.

98
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,300
How could you say her name so clearly?

99
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,300
Hey, this was your fault.

100
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,640
Yeah. This was your fault, Munjeong.

101
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,010
Are you serious?

102
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,640
You all brought it up…

103
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,100
What?

104
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,600
It's been over two years.
I can't even say her name?

105
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,440
Yeah. You don't even recall
Attorney Kang from two years ago.

106
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,110
No, we didn't meet then.

107
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,820
-It was 10 years ago, not two.
-What?

108
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,360
-What?
-10 years ago?

109
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,320
You keep saving
the important bits for last.

110
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,910
Are you a storyteller or what?

111
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,250
Right. You went to Hong Kong
while in law school too.

112
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,920
Juhyeong was a law student,
and I was still an undergrad.

113
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,510
You even said
we should meet up again in Korea.

114
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,590
I said what?

115
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,970
My gosh! You two were a thing!

116
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,930
-You were a thing!
-What is this?

117
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,060
I didn't know you had
such skills back then.

118
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,470
In any case, who cares?
He doesn't even remember.

119
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,310
So, how was Hong Kong?

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
It was so beautiful back then.

121
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,150
Which part?

122
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,240
Hey, which part?

123
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,540
But are you sure
we actually agreed to meet again?

124
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,460
Geez. And here I thought he'd remembered.

125
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,750
I mean, it's just not true.
You think I'd say that?

126
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,550
-You did.
-You said you didn't even remember.

127
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,090
Or maybe he does remember.

128
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,850
No, I don't. It's because
I would've never said that.

129
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,180
Don't worry about it.

130
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,640
Want me to get you another glass?

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,230
Then, could I have some soju?

132
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,610
Beer upsets my stomach a bit.

133
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,860
Goodness, you should've said so earlier!

134
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,530
-One soju, please!
-Thank you.

135
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,910
-Still, we just met and you offered.
-Come on! I'll take that formality and…

136
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,370
I threw it out. Okay?
No need to be so formal.

137
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,160
-You can relax.
-I will.

138
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,790
So I guess you threw away
your beer on me then.

139
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,090
What?

140
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,460
-What's wrong with you?
-It's true.

141
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,550
Gosh, don't take it that way.

142
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,880
Your glass was empty, so I shared mine.

143
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,260
Come on. We go back 10 years.

144
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,220
Ten years? Says who?

145
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,520
But what did you want to meet about today?

146
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,820
Isn't this just about
getting to know each other?

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,990
Is this just a casual get-together?

148
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,820
No, not exactly.

149
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,330
Since you're all busy people,

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,660
let's get straight to the point.

151
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,540
Yes, please.

152
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,160
Your law firms

153
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
and law office…

154
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,840
Let's merge them into one.

155
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,150
-I take Line 2 on the subway.
-What? Me too.

156
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,060
-Which way?
-I go toward Jamsil too.

157
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,360
We're this way. You?

158
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,690
-Okay.
-That way?

159
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,940
-Yes.
-See you next time!

160
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,030
-Bye!
-Good night.

161
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,490
Which way are you going?

162
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,200
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

163
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,420
It still seems
to bother Juhyeong, doesn't it?

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah.

165
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,750
I figured it was okay
to talk about her now,

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,550
so I tossed it out there.

167
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,010
But I guess not.

168
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,590
I didn't expect that at all
from someone who seems so chill.

169
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,680
Right?

170
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,350
Hey, doesn't Attorney Kang
seem like a good person?

171
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,770
Yeah, she's super friendly.

172
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,560
I almost snapped at her
earlier by accident.

173
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,690
-You're getting in just now?
-Yes, you're still up?

174
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,030
I woke up in the middle.

175
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,070
-What about dinner?
-I had dinner with my friends.

176
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,150
Okay, get some rest.

177
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,570
-Okay, good night.
-All right.

178
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,670
He doesn't remember me?

179
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,140
I mean, how could you forget
someone this cute?

180
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,850
SUPREME COURT UPDATE

181
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,440
A new precedent.

182
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,110
Let's have a look.

183
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,680
Ten years, my foot.

184
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,560
COURT, PROSECUTION OFFICE,
REGISTRATION BUREAU

185
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,320
Episode 2 More Than Meets the Eye

186
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,450
It's not much, but please enjoy.

187
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,950
Gosh, you didn't have to!
Thank you. I am in your debt.

188
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,830
I should be the one saying that.
I'm the new one here.

189
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,620
I didn't even know you were a lawyer.

190
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,790
You look as young as a student!

191
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,790
What kind of student looks like this?

192
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

193
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,730
Attorney Ahn?

194
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,690
Attorney Kang told me to give this to you.

195
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,520
She wanted to thank us
getting together for her.

196
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,280
It wasn't for her though.

197
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,030
Come on, it was. What do you mean?

198
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,660
I don't drink coffee.

199
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,370
How would Attorney Kang even know that?

200
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,620
Just take it, will you?

201
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,800
If you don't want it, fine. More for me.

202
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,140
That's why I'm asking you for help.

203
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,860
Originally, you only wanted us
to draft the seizure request,

204
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,070
so we gave you a discounted rate.

205
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,070
And I'm going with you free of charge
because I understand your situation.

206
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,740
I'm also aware, but…

207
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,990
-What's going on?
-I wouldn't be asking

208
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,990
-if I wasn't so desperate!
-Tomorrow's the asset seizure.

209
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,000
They're going to force open the door
and start tagging items,

210
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,210
so he wants a lawyer to come along too.

211
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,670
-There's really no way?
-I understand your situation,

212
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,920
but we really can't.

213
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,720
All right, then.

214
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,970
I'll see you tomorrow.

215
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,600
Mr. Eom, are you going
to the asset seizure tomorrow?

216
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,070
Yes. You don't have to worry about it.

217
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,570
What kind of person is the debtor?

218
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,320
He runs a business.
It's a classic dine and dash.

219
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,070
The lender's the real victim.

220
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,950
It seems he lent his whole fortune.

221
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,340
You're going
to the asset seizure tomorrow?

222
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,800
Yes, I do feel bad for the lender,
but I'm also curious.

223
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,300
You're going to see some ugly stuff.

224
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,220
Debtors who are cornered tend to lash out.

225
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,390
Don't go. What for?
You'll just come across trouble.

226
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,940
No, it's okay.
Word is, the debtor's actually loaded.

227
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,770
But he's hidden all his assets,
so they have no choice but to seize them.

228
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,110
Rich people aren't easy to deal with.

229
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,360
-Wait! He hasn't taken a picture yet.
-I did.

230
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,030
-What? When?
-Earlier.

231
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,410
He's fast now.

232
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,700
Hold on! It's not ready yet.

233
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,750
But if you just started yesterday,

234
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,750
you should be swamped with looking
at your own case files right now.

235
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,790
Do you have time to tag along
on some other case

236
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,840
just because you feel for them
and are curious?

237
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
You're only a first-year.

238
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,220
Yes, I've already reviewed
all my case files.

239
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,800
All of them?

240
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,510
Yes, but as I looked through,
a few parts were confusing.

241
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,680
-Can I ask you about them later?
-Why would you ask me?

242
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,270
That's what it said on the handover file.

243
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,310
It said to ask you about difficult cases.

244
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,730
-What?
-Wait.

245
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,230
That was in the handover file?

246
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,570
Yes. "Ask Ahn Juhyeong
for difficult cases."

247
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,700
"For good restaurants, ask Bae Munjeong."

248
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,580
And it said to ask Ha Sanggi
for savings accounts,

249
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
retirement plans, and tax deductions.

250
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,830
It turns out Mr. Yu
was more calculating than I thought.

251
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,750
Look at him.
He's already calling his friend "Mr. Yu."

252
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,510
Well, what about me?

253
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,640
You were…

254
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,930
I guess there was nothing.

255
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,770
Yes.

256
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,100
I was the closest to him though.

257
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,020
I brought it along just in case.
They're notes my predecessor wrote.

258
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,150
-I don't understand the part he marked.
-Let me see.

259
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,910
Gosh, look at these insane indents.

260
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,990
I know.
That firm always formats like that.

261
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,950
-Hey, Juhyeong…
-I'm in a hurry.

262
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,410
-I have to…
-Just wait a second!

263
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,830
I'm busy this afternoon too.

264
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,710
Geez.

265
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,170
It's ready.

266
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,460
Eat up.
Ask him after we're done eating.

267
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,680
-Okay.
-I want some meat.

268
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,090
-That's good.
-Here you go.

269
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,390
What are you consulting on, Juhyeong?

270
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,100
It's related to an eviction lawsuit.

271
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,310
A real estate transfer claim
through the creditor's subrogation right.

272
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,770
What? What lawsuit?

273
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,070
It's a lawsuit to evict someone
for not paying debts.

274
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,610
You made it sound too fancy.

275
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,280
Did you do that to intimidate her?

276
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,360
It's the same as mine.
Tracking someone down over unpaid loans.

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,740
It's totally different. I file lawsuits
and don't chase people to their homes.

278
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,250
Hey, hurry and eat.
You said you were busy.

279
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,750
Cooking it longer was a good idea.

280
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,300
-The flavor needs to infuse in the tofu.
-It's really good.

281
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,930
I'd be better if it simmered a bit more.

282
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,190
I forgot my phone!

283
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,490
Goodness.

284
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,830
-Bye.
-See you.

285
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,800
Later.

286
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,220
I think you might be
misremembering things.

287
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,100
-About what?
-We never made plans to meet in Seoul.

288
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,350
That wouldn't have happened.

289
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,690
Try to think carefully again.

290
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,250
That's what all the attitude was about?

291
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,430
<i>I believe I'm remembering it correctly.</i>

292
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,060
<i>This is kind of ridiculous.</i>

293
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,100
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

294
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,110
<i>Okay.</i>

295
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,110
Is he insane?

296
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,250
IS HE INSANE?

297
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,460
-Huiji, do you have a minute?
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,550
Can you sit in on a consult for me?

299
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,180
Sure.

300
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,150
Mr. Jang Hyeonseok!

301
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,990
I said no one by that name's here.

302
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,860
Are you sure he's not in there?
It's the right address.

303
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,780
Yes, it is.

304
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,870
But no one by that name lives here,
so leave.

305
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,040
We were here two days ago!

306
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,660
Look, we have documents
showing he lives here.

307
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,920
There's a court order to vacate,
and we have to enforce it today.

308
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
It makes no sense that he's suddenly gone.

309
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,260
Either way, they're not here.

310
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,130
So leave. Get out!

311
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,340
How many times do I…

312
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,680
Is he really not here?

313
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,890
-I need the restroom.
-Are you insane?

314
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,430
Get out!

315
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,980
Thank you so much.

316
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,860
I agreed to help
because of your circumstances,

317
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,200
but I can't do it next time.

318
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,120
No, I should be the one apologizing.

319
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Gosh.

320
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Hey, hang in there.

321
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Okay.

322
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,540
Thank you.

323
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,800
NEIGHBORLY SAVINGS BANK
KIM JAEWAN

324
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,010
Yes, I heard the eviction order
didn't go through today.

325
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,600
No. We went, but some stranger
answered and claimed

326
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,350
Jang Hyeonseok didn't live there.

327
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,810
Let's consider a provisional injunction
to block transfer of occupancy.

328
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,270
First, look at this
since that's what you came for.

329
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
Okay.

330
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,740
Mr. Na told me you wanted to hear
the explanation again

331
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,910
before the hearing date.

332
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,990
Yes. I'm still unclear on a few parts.

333
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,710
Right. We did go over it once by phone
before the complaint was filed.

334
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,080
Basically, you loaned him money, right?

335
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,340
Yes, he said he needed it
for a lease deposit.

336
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,340
Right, but he hasn't paid back
the principal or the interest?

337
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,050
-That's right.
-So as collateral,

338
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,890
the lease deposit was transferred to you?

339
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,510
-Yes.
-Okay.

340
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,810
In this case, the debtor's lease
should have ended first.

341
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,810
But since we acquired
the lease deposit claim,

342
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,310
they can't oppose us
with a renewed contract.

343
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,360
The original lease term has ended now,

344
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,190
so the contract is considered terminated.

345
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,820
But that doesn't mean

346
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,820
the landlord is required
to give back the deposit to us.

347
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,490
The debtor must hand over

348
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,830
the rental property to the landlord first

349
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,080
before the deposit can be returned.

350
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,700
Since that isn't happening,

351
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,870
we're exercising
our subrogation right as the creditor

352
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,000
to forcibly claim the property.

353
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,090
That's the lawsuit.

354
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,050
Right.

355
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,060
Okay.

356
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,600
This is us. And this is the debtor.

357
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,190
That's the landlord of the debtor's home.

358
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,400
-Who's this again?
-Us?

359
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,860
-The debtor.
-The debtor.

360
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,990
DEPOSIT

361
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,490
Now, once you move out,

362
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,830
the public housing corporation
can return the deposit to the bank.

363
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,790
The bank is evicting you
to get the deposit back.

364
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,960
Does that make sense?

365
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,130
Yes.

366
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,010
Since it's true
that you haven't paid the bank back,

367
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,220
so legally,
it's hard to block the lawsuit.

368
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,470
Then, does that mean
I'll just get kicked out of my house?

369
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,770
You should still fight it somehow.
At least try to buy yourself some time.

370
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,770
But the trial's tomorrow.

371
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,110
It seems cases like these
are common nowadays.

372
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,360
I heard about a similar one earlier today.

373
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,070
I heard the lawyer's office for the bank
was in this building,

374
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,200
so I came to try and plead with them.

375
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,540
I didn't even get to see their lawyer.
They turned me away at the door.

376
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,790
I'm grasping at straws,
so I came up here.

377
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,170
The floor below us?

378
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,670
Do you know the lawyers downstairs?

379
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,300
COMPLAINT FILED BY LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN
ATTORNEYS NA, AHN

380
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,340
What are you consulting on, Juhyeong?

381
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,430
It's related to an eviction lawsuit.

382
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,520
A real estate transfer claim
through the creditor's subrogation right.

383
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,850
It's a lawsuit to evict someone
for not paying debts.

384
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,530
If you're close to them,
could you ask them to drop the case?

385
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,530
The lawyers downstairs
are just doing their job

386
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,240
on behalf of the bank.

387
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,790
It's not my place to ask them to drop it.
It wouldn't be proper.

388
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,790
Right, of course.

389
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,590
Then, don't you take on
any pro bono cases?

390
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,250
I know it's shameless of me to ask.

391
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,970
I'll ask my director and get back to you.

392
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,340
-Thank you.
-No problem at all.

393
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,850
I used to take pro bono cases
because I wanted to help.

394
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,940
But once word got out,

395
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,560
everyone started showing up
asking for free help.

396
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,730
So I stopped.

397
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,780
I can see that.

398
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,360
I do feel for him.

399
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,950
But I'm afraid I can't.

400
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,800
All that fancy talk,

401
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,420
but he's just kicking people out
of public housing while acting cool.

402
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,550
COMPLAINT

403
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,440
Don't we need an appointment?

404
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,360
Don't places like this
usually take walk-ins?

405
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,570
There are so many law offices here.

406
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,070
How do we know where to go for counseling?

407
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,870
-There's too many to choose from.
-Should we try every floor?

408
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,750
-Let's skip the 6th floor.
-Why?

409
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,410
That one's a law office, not a law firm.

410
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,710
-Is there a difference?
-Doesn't it feel like a smaller operation?

411
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,190
Sixth floor…

412
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
A merger?

413
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
Some of you run law firms,

414
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,140
and others run law offices.

415
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,100
But don't most people prefer
to run a law firm if they could?

416
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,810
Law offices aren't necessarily lesser.

417
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,110
I'm well aware of that.

418
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,150
But do regular folks see it that way?

419
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,820
Probably not.

420
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,030
-Attorney Ahn, are you busy?
-Yes.

421
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,330
Attorney Kim Geoncheol left,

422
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,660
so you know we have
an open partner spot, right?

423
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,370
-Yes, I'm aware.
-Any thoughts of taking that spot?

424
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,250
-All of a sudden?
-Come on. You've been at it for 10 years.

425
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,170
Sir, don't keep adding a year
every time you bring it up.

426
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,510
It's been eight years
since I passed probation

427
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,720
and nine if you're counting by calendar.

428
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,720
Either way, you're due to go solo.

429
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,390
-Yes, well…
-Who stays an associate

430
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,850
this long in Seocho-dong?

431
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,060
No, I have no thoughts
about that right now.

432
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,980
A few years ago, you talked about
starting your own practice with me.

433
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,480
No, I like where I'm at now.

434
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,410
Really?

435
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
-Okay, don't worry about it.
-Okay.

436
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,170
But we're not a law office.
We're already a law firm.

437
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,800
So why should we do this?

438
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,760
You currently have
only two registered partners now, right?

439
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,800
Since Attorney Kim left?

440
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,430
You need at least three,
excluding associates.

441
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,220
We're planning to bring someone in soon.

442
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,440
If your firm stays non-compliant
for a few more months,

443
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,940
you'll end up paying back a ton in taxes.

444
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

445
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

446
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,370
She's coming
to the asset seizure tomorrow.

447
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,910
She's really dedicated.

448
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,500
Right? I think we made a good hire.

449
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,500
I had a great feeling about her
during the interview.

450
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,710
She's very eager to learn too.

451
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,130
You were so worried
since we only had one resume come in.

452
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,930
Exactly. We rarely get applicants.

453
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,690
I hope she doesn't leave soon
for some bigger firm though.

454
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,360
No, I don't think she will.

455
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,160
You're saying we should ditch
our current independent partners

456
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,290
and only merge
with the managing partners here?

457
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,080
If we ditch them, we'd lose headcount.
There'd be no point in merging.

458
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,830
You'd need to grow in numbers
for it to mean something.

459
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,500
With more lawyers,
the firm will look bigger.

460
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,630
And that would help with both business

461
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,720
and recruitment.

462
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,890
Ms. Kang,

463
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,310
it seemed like
finding that new hire wasn't easy.

464

LAW GROUP CHUNGGONG

465
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,390
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

466
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,650
I need more business cards.
Could you order them?

467
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,560
-Sure.
-Ms. Kim, hold on.

468
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,690
What's the matter, sir?

469
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,440
Put a hold on ordering those for now.

470
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,530
Sorry?

471
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,740
-But I only have about 20 left.
-Just wait a bit, all right?

472
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,820
You don't even use them.
Do you use them for something else?

473
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,370
-No, it's not like that.
-Exactly, so just hold off.

474
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,660
If the boss says so,
there's always a reason.

475
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,000
It's for business reasons.

476
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,630
It's not like you scout clients.

477
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,000
Yes, sir. I understand.

478
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,670
No new cards. Okay?

479
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,380
Gosh.

480
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,760
Thank you.

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,610
Hyungmin.

<i>Law Group Hyungmin.</i>

486
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,160
That will be the name of the merged firm.

487
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Well, you've already picked a name?
I have no thoughts of joining though.

488
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,790
If you merge,

489
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,790
you'll get the top four floors
of our eight-floor building.

490
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,550
A single law firm taking up
half the building with a name

491
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,340
that matches the building's?

492
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,050
It looks way more impressive, right?

493
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,930
It'll look like the firm
owns the building.

494
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
It'll be beneficial.

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,650
Law Group Hyungmin in Hyungmin Building.

497
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,320
It'll look great even on a business card.

498
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,030
Law Group Hyungmin,
located in Hyungmin Building.

499
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,780
What do you think?
It would help with business.

500
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,490
-Right, Director Seong?
-I like it.

501
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,450
It's nice.

502
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,330
-Right? I like it.
-You already operate separately.

503
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,580
So even if you merge,

504
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,340
you'll still keep
your own clients and profits.

505
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,260
Nothing really changes.

506
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,090
Except now, you look like a major firm.

507
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,260
I can't see why you'd say no.

508
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,520
Gosh, Ms. Kim.

509
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,140
You seem to know everything
about this field.

510
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,600
Are you a former lawyer?

511
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,480
I've spent my fair share of time
in Seocho-dong.

512
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,660
Let's assume we have no reason
to turn it down.

513
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,660
But what would you get out of this?

514
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,250
Me? Nothing really.

515
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,420
Then, I won't accept the offer.

516
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,710
Because I don't benefit?

517
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,380
There's no such thing as a deal
with zero upside.

518
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,260
Saying you have nothing to gain

519
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,180
just sounds like
you have something to hide from us.

520
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,640
You're lawyers through and through.

521
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,810
All right.

522
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,060
Here's the truth.

523
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,480
If your firms merge
and share the same name as the building's,

524
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,400
it'll be harder for you to move out.

525
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,830
I want to maintain
stable, long-term tenants.

526
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,670
So does that sound convincing enough?

527
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,920
Even with all of that,

528
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,920
if one of us wanted to
move somewhere else,

529
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,670
it wouldn't be impossible to open a branch

530
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,550
under the same name.

531
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,720
Well, it's not impossible,
but I'm sure it'd be a pain.

532
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,600
Make it easy to enter and hard to leave.

533
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,730
That's basic business.

534
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,690
And one more thing.

535
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,480
If you do merge,
I might throw a few cases your way.

536
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,820
Maybe often.

537
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,030
I always have a lot of lawsuits
going on around me.

538
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,950
What do you say? Would you like to merge?

539
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,160
ORDER AND GROUNDS

540
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,250
MANAGING PARTNER KANG JEONGYUN

00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780

545
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,400
Thank you.

OFFICIAL BUSINESS

547
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,000
How do you live here
and not pay your debts?

548
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,420
Hello.

549
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,840
Hello!

550
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,510
What about Mr. Eom?

551
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,520
He said he had an errand
to do early this morning.

552
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,350
I guess he'll be a little late.

553
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,310
Okay, we'll just open the door then.

554
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,320
We'll open the door
and begin the asset seizure.

555
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,150
Are you the creditor?

556
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,940
-Yes.
-Okay, right here.

557
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,990
Just sign here, please.

558
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,530
CREDITOR: SON
DEBTOR: KIM

559
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,740
And…

560
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,910
-Here.
-Are you the witness for the creditor?

561
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,080
-Yes.
-Here.

562
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,660
Please sign here.

563
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,920
Hey, Jeongsik!

564
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,290
-What?
-Put that out and come here.

565
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,880
Here, sign this.

566
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,340
-Sign it here?
-Yeah.

567
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,090
Okay.

568
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,930
All right, then. We'll open the door.

569
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,100
Okay.

570
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,740
Excuse me.

571
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,080
What are you people doing?

572
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,790
We're from
Seoul Eastern District Court.

573
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,580
According to case 2024-65123,
we'll proceed with the asset seizure.

574
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,300
-Sir, please open the door.
-You can't just barge in!

575
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,260
-Please move, sir.
-Stop it!

576
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,090
-Come on, sir!
-Sir!

577
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,010
-How dare you barge in?
-Can I leave now?

578
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,800
Hang on. You signed as a witness,
so you should at least step inside.

579
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm busy though.

580
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,430
For goodness' sake.

581
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,680
Hold on!

582
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,810
I'm done.

583
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,360
-Don't waste your energy, dear.
-Right!

584
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,610
Come in or don't! I don't care!

585
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,610
-Easy! This flooring isn't cheap.
-Please excuse us.

586
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,820
What are these fools
doing here this early?

587
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,200
-Come this way.
-Okay.

588
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,240
-Hey, upstairs…
-Pay back the money!

589
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,040
-What money?
-Pay back what you borrowed!

590
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,040
I said I would, you fool!

591
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,460
Oh, my God!

592
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,130
If that breaks, you're paying for it!

593
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,380
-Yes, we'll take care of it.
-Why are you going into the kitchen?

594
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,920
You scoundrels!

595
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,720
-Tag that silver tray too.
-What silver tray?

596
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,430
-That's not silver!
-Sir.

597
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,560
This is obstruction. Please step aside.

598
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,560
-Come on!
-That blue painting.

599
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,060
The blue one? Here it is.

600
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,150
Hey, who are you?

601
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,860
For someone looking so clean-cut,
why pull this nonsense?

602
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,200
-Get out!
-She's the creditor's witness.

603
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,110
Quiet! Get out of here!

604
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,070
What a joke!

605
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,490
Unbelievable!

606
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,250
You'll be charged with obstruction!

607
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,040
-Fine, whatever!
-Whatever? Okay!

608
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,630
Why are you opening that?

609
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,550
That's where my underwear is!
How dare you touch them, you creep?

610
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,340
-Are you a pervert?
-Don't be ridiculous!

611
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,260
-What do you want with women's underwear?
-Geez, I don't want them!

612
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,470
-Don't stick that label there!
-Yes, ma'am.

613
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,100
-My clothes are going to get ruined!
-They won't.

614
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,690
My goodness, this is unbelievable.
Why are you digging through everything?

615
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,480
-Don't tag that!
-We have to look through all of this.

616
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,320
I don't believe this!

617
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,150
-And over here…
-No, not there!

618
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,110
Gosh, there's a bunch.

619
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,120
Seriously, that's…

620
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,910
-What am I going to do?
-Sir!

621
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,170
-Yes?
-Over here!

622
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,920
-Just a moment.
-Are you nuts? Why are you opening that?

623
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,550
My goodness.

624
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,590
Why did you open that? What are you doing?

625
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,970
You can't go up! Don't!

626
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,260
My goodness!

627
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,640
-I knew it.
-Seriously, these…

628
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,650
All of these were borrowed, okay?

629
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,320
We borrowed all of these!

630
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,440
They're not mine. None of them are mine!

631
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,990
-Seriously!
-Why on earth are you doing this?

632
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,700
-What?
-What you're doing is obstruction!

633
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,870
I want to be naked in my own house!

634
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,200
So what's it to you?

635
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,960
-Put it back on!
-Put what on?

636
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,960
-Get dressed.
-Don't touch me!

637
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,340
But you touched other people's money!

638
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,090
I didn't touch a thing! Get out!

639
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,010
Yeah. That's a good idea.

640
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,260
Yeah! Let's all strip. Come on!

641
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,730
Hold on!

642
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,890
-Happy now? Satisfied?
-How dare you?

643
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,100
-Do you?
-Get out!

644
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,480
-Aren't you hot?
-Come out!

645
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,730
-Take it off! We have nothing to lose!
-Hold on!

646
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,320
Sir, is this right?

647
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,780
What else can we do
if they keep acting like that?

648
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,200
Hey! What are you doing there?

649
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,740
Who said you can use the bathroom?

650
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,910
You…

651
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,870
What are you looking at?

652
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,170
You stripped to make us look
and feel uncomfortable!

653
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,500
Well, we saw
and we were uncomfortable. Happy?

654
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,470
Gosh.

655
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,470
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

656
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,770
There must've been an accident somewhere.
Traffic was so bad.

657
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
It's okay.

658
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,900
Things happen.

659
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,400
I'm sorry.

660
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,990
It must have been really tough.

661
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,700
I'm okay.

662
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,830
Let's just go.

663
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,840
I went up to the secret room,

664
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,470
and there were tons of bags and paintings.

665
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,930
Then, I heard yelling downstairs.

666
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,720
I went down and Chairman Kim
was taking off all his clothes.

667
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,310
-Seriously…
-Gosh.

668
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,520
See? I told you not to go.

669
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,440
I told you rich people
aren't easy to deal with.

670
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,020
They have so much
and don't want to lose any of it.

671
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,940
Also, it's not something
to be so upset about.

672
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,650
Rich or not,
people just do whatever they can.

673
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,150
Come on.

674
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,410
-That doesn't mean they should.
-Exactly.

675
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,580
Where's the food?

676
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,580
I said we shouldn't come here.
The food takes forever.

677
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,040
That's because
they only start breading the pork cutlets

678
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,590
right when you order.

679
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,340
That's why it's so good.

680
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,630
I have a trial this afternoon.

681
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,220
Always acting busy.

682
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,380
You should've brought
your files like I did,

683
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,010
so you can head straight to court.

684
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,720
-What trial is it?
-You know. The real estate transfer claim.

685
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,140
The one against Jang Hyeonseok?

686
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,440
How did you know?

687
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,110
That's the case where a savings bank

688
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,320
was suing a public housing tenant
for eviction.

689
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,900
It must feel bad to work on the case.

690
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,240
Did you feel bad
during the asset seizure?

691
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,210
They both didn't pay, so we acted.
What's there to feel bad about?

692
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,170
But how did you even know
about Juhyeong's case?

693
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,250
Jang Hyeonseok came to us for a consult.

694
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,590
It turned out to be Juhyeong's case.

695
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,720
By chance?

696
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,470
Not exactly.

697
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,390
He wanted me to ask Juhyeong
to drop the case.

698
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,310
Why didn't you tell me?

699
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,730
Still, I couldn't ask you to drop it.
It's your job.

700
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,650
That's surprising.

701
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,480
I thought you were nosy
like a certain someone.

702
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,900
I guess you're not that bad.

703
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,790
Me? Are you talking about me?

704
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,500
I'm not that bad.

705
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,910
Why are you so serious?

706
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,920
I have feelings too, okay?

707
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,460
-What?
-Here are your pork cutlets.

708
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,460
Thank you. I'll take mine first.

709
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,920
Thank you.

710
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,220
-Shouldn't you eat first?
-Go on and eat.

711
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,970
See you.

712
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,890
-Bye.
-Bye.

713
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Coffee?

714
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,990
Why are you always cold to only me?

715
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,410
I was cold to only you?

716
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,240
Do you have main character syndrome?

717
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,580
If we consider the past,
I should be the one being cold.

718
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,130
But why are you doing that to me?

719
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,340
What did I do back then?

720
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,460
You said we should meet up, and then…

721
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,430
Never mind. Why bother?

722
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,560
Well, I wouldn't know
since I don't remember you that well.

723
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,230
So he's not insane? He's just a jerk?

724
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,700
Defendant? Mr. Jang Hyeonseok?

725
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Please sit.

726
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,490
You sue someone to evict them
just because they missed a payment?

727
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,450
You call yourself a lawyer?

728
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,210
Then, you can just repay them.

729
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,670
Shouldn't the court
be protecting people like me?

730
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,750
Please sit.

731
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,170
Counsel for the plaintiff,
is there any chance of a settlement?

732
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,260
No, the plaintiff won't settle
unless the full amount is repaid.

733
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,350
If I had the money, I would've paid!

734
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,770
What do you want me to do?

735
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,270
Sit down!

736
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,350
Defendant.

737
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,520
One more disrespectful outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

738
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,480
Yes, I'm sorry.

739
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,860
So Defendant, you can't repay
what you borrowed. Is that correct?

740
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,660
Yes, that's right.

741
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,200
Then, it's true.

742
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,950
So why are you getting this worked up?

743
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,460
Excuse me, sir!

744
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,550
Look, isn't there any other way?

745
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,170
Just pay back the debt.

746
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,050
But it's not like I'm refusing
to pay on purpose!

747
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,930
If you borrowed money, please repay it.

748
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,140
That's our client's stance.

749
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,770
WE REQUEST THE CLAIMS BE UPHELD

750
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,410
What a long day!

751
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:16,910
Time to go home.

752
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,040
Time to go home…

753
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,210
The kid acted out,
so I gave them a warning.

754
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,340
That's a relief.

755
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,050
Actually, we're planning
to merge floors 5 through 8.

756
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,430
So we've started clearing people out.

757
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,980
Your drink.

758
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,350
Please, continue.

759
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,860
I'll get going.

760
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,010
My goodness, I'm so tired!

761
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,070
SUPREME COURT UPDATE

762
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,450
Do they always have to
send these at night?

763
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,730
A CREDITOR OF A PUBLIC HOUSING TENANT

764
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,690
TERMINATED THE LEASE ON THEIR BEHALF

765
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,250
A CREDITOR OF A PUBLIC HOUSING TENANT

766
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,500
TERMINATED THE LEASE ON THEIR BEHALF

767
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,840
What are we supposed to do now?

768
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm here for a divorce consultation.

769
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,090
I see.

770
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,390
-Sir.
-Thank you.

771
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,690
The Supreme Court set a new precedent.
The case is exactly like ours.

772
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,310
It says going forward, it'll be harder
to evict public housing tenants

773
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,980
like Jang Hyeonseok.

774
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,320
Then, what?

775
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,070
Given this, dropping the lawsuit
would be the right move.

776
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,870
LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

777
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,540
Listen, these public housing leases
run 10, sometimes 20 years.

778
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,710
So we just sit and wait until it ends?

779
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,420
That would mean a huge loss for our bank.
Isn't there anything we can do?

780
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,050
This precedent
literally came out yesterday.

781
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,840
Jang Hyeonseok probably doesn't know,

782
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,590
and even the judge
may not be aware of it yet.

783
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,430
Then, what do we do?

784
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,560
Just because we know about this precedent

785
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,020
doesn't mean we're obligated
to bring it up.

786
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,900
-Let's proceed as is.
-Is that okay?

787
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,020
Yes, that's what we should do.

788
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,780
Act natural.

789
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,160
-Don't look here and just act natural.
-Hurry up and take it!

790
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,330
-There you go.
-Can I eat naturally?

791
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,660
No, wait!

792
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,620
-Hurry up.
-Hold on!

793
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,750
-You're taking all day!
-Help me out!

794
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:49,830
The cream is melting.

795
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,170
-Done? Can I eat the cake?
-Hold on.

796
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,050
Isn't your blog called "A Lawyer's Table?"
Why take photos of drinks then?

797
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,760
That narrow-minded mindset
won't get you far.

798
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,090
Then rename it.

799
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,560
"A Lawyer's Food and Beverage."

800
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,680
That sounds awful.

801
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:08,980
-Come on.
-What?

802
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:10,770
What?

803
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,440
No one called you.

804
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,980
-What are you so deep in thought about?
-It's nothing.

805
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,990
What do you mean "It's nothing"?

806
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,490
Even through the camera,
I can see your face is full of worry.

807
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,080
Yeah, spill it. Big bro's listening.

808
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,660
Did you have a blind date
and you liked her?

809
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,710
-How about another bet?
-There she goes again.

810
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,960
I guess you saw the precedent.

811
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,500
Isn't that what it's about?

812
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,960
Wait, you read it?

813
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,710
-It came out yesterday.
-Wait.

814
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,470
You read a precedent
that came out yesterday?

815
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,550
Is there an exam we need to take?

816
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,930
What's with you two?

817
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,060
You're dropping the case
because of it, right?

818
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,430
Nope. We're not dropping it.

819
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,520
You're not?

820
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,690
In that case,
the plaintiff was also a bank,

821
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,860
and the defendant
was a public housing tenant.

822
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,070
They used the deposit
as collateral when the loan was given.

823
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,450
-It's the exact same as yours.
-Were you shut down by the precedent?

824
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,780
-Wasn't it going to be an easy win?
-I know. I read it carefully too.

825
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,500
Wait! How did you even find out
about a precedent that came out yesterday?

826
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,750
But if you proceed,
you'll lose the case.

827
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,300
I might've lost against you,

828
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,430
but not with these two.

829
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,010
What?

830
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,970
-Did you know about it?
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

831
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,180
-Can't we win too?
-Did you see it yesterday?

832
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,900
-I guess not.
-Can we not while we eat?

833
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,570
-Not reading is normal.
-You just jumped to that conclusion.

834
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,990
He's not just a jerk.
He's a total thug.

LATEST SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

849
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,990
-You said I could play with it after you!
-It's not even yours!

850
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,750
I want to play with my friends too!

851
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,250
Don't run!
The neighbors are going to complain!

852
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,170
-Honey, stop.
-You promised I could play after you!

853
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,050
We don't even know
how long we'll be staying here.

854

-Who's that?
-Who is it?

855
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,680
Hush. Wait inside.

856
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,150
Hello.

857
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,960
They're notes my predecessor wrote.

858
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,340
I don't understand the part he marked.

859
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,340
Gosh, look at these insane indents.

860
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,510
I know.
That firm always formats like that.

861
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,890
I'm not an expert,

862
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,930
but I heard the Supreme Court
recently ruled that people like me

863
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,150
can't be kicked out anymore,
so I submitted that information.

864
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,940
There was a relevant precedent?

865
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,650
Counsel for the plaintiff,
were you aware of this?

866
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,940
-Yes.
-With this precedent,

867
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,200
it's hard to say

868
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,280
that the defendant
still has an obligation to vacate.

869
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,990
Counsel for the plaintiff,
have you had time to review this?

870
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,870
We'll take a closer look
and either withdraw the claim

871
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,330
or submit a rebuttal
before the next hearing.

872
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,420
All right, please do.

873
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,000
But it seems to me

874
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:52,050
that a withdrawal
might be your best option.

875
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,140
I'll discuss it with my client.

876
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,020
Sir, I'm sorry.

877
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,940
I became so angry during the last trial
and acted so rudely towards you.

878
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,820
I'm not usually like that.

879
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,320
No, it's all right.

880
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,070
I just didn't want to end up
out on the street.

881
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,250
We're all just doing whatever we can.

882
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,910
You didn't have
any personal animosity towards me.

883
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,790
-Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

884
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,650
You were taking too long,
so we started eating.

885
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,320
-We literally just started.
-How was your trial?

886
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:58,530
Come eat.

887
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,950
What was that, Ms. Kang?

888
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
It was pro bono.

889
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,170
Someone was focused on personal gain,
so I did some public interest work.

890
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,500
You should've officially signed on
and shown up then.

891
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,590
Are you mad I didn't show up at court?

892
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,050
I'm not mad.

893
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,260
-What happened?
-I think we should stay quiet.

894
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,980
You said you weren't that nosy.

895
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,400
But that wasn't pro bono.
That was meddling.

896
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,940
The precedent's already out.

897
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,190
It's not like I made it up.

898
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,700
-I just let things follow their course.
-Do you agree with that precedent?

899
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,870
-What?
-Do you agree with the Supreme Court?

900
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,250
Are you saying you disagree with it?

901
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,960
<i>Public housing exists to protect people</i>
<i>who have a hard time</i>

902
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,840
<i>finding homes like Jang Hyeonseok.</i>

903
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,050
You can't just kick them out so easily.

904
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,800
You think I'm the bad guy.

905
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,760
You wonder why I took this case.

906
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,930
I'm not criticizing you for taking it.

907
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,440
But you should at least
feel uneasy about it.

908
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,940
You should be aware of what you're doing.

909
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,730
You said it was "public interest work"?

910
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,400
Are you sure that really was
in the public's interest?

911
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,950
For lawyers, public interest means
defending their client's rights.

912
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,950
Making the other side
accountable for their violations.

913
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,620
That is public interest.

914
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,170
Thinking beyond that is arrogance.

915
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,130
Does that belief make you feel better?

916
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,340
It's not that thought of arrogance
holding you back.

917
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,760
You just lack the courage
to think that far.

918
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,970
It seems you're the one
who doesn't know what they're saying.

919
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,470
What do you think would happen
if I told the bank to drop the lawsuit

920
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,470
and that they can't sue anyone
who can't repay anymore?

921
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,390
What do you think
would immediately happen?

922
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,940
Less people would be kicked out
of their homes by banks.

923
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,360
Banks are going to stop lending
to people like Jang Hyeonseok.

924
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,570
The world isn't that black and white.

925
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,450
If one thing changes,
everything else related to it changes.

926
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,410
We're sorry, sir.

927
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:06,490
For now, we can't offer deposit loans
for public housing.

928
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,540
It's due to a Supreme Court precedent.

929
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,330
That was for people
who didn't repay their loans.

930
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,580
-I don't miss my interest payments.
-I'm sorry.

931
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,380
So even if awarded public housing,

932
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,880
more people won't be able to move in
because they can't cover the deposit.

933
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,930
If collateral can't be enforced,
you think banks would still lend?

934
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:26,220
That means the ones who borrow
and repay properly end up suffering.

935
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,980
And still, you're certain
this is public interest?

936
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,440
Why do you only see one side?

937
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,900
When a person loses their home,
their entire world falls apart.

938
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,320
Do you think one person's world
counts as public interest?

939
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,740
Hey, stop it.

940
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,120
-You're so loud.
-She's right.

941
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,740
Hey, cut it out!

942
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,500
You said not to act like a lawyer,
but you're doing it the most!

943
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,170
Sorry, don't mind us. Please eat. Sorry.

944
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,790
Eat before your food gets cold.

945
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,380
-Let's eat.
-Sorry.

946
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,590
We're really sorry.

947
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,520
-Have you made a decision?
-Yes.

948
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,310
Please file the withdrawal.

949
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,480
We've reviewed it internally

950
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:21,530
and decided to look for another solution.

951
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,070
I see.

952
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,950
I'll also think it over
and see if there's another way.

953
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,530
Okay.

954
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,660
Withdrawing is simple.

955
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,710
But the issue is what will follow.

956
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,880
I know.

957
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,700
-It's dragging on for a while.
-What is?

958
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,200
Come on!

959
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:15,330
You've known each other 10 years.
Let's make up.

960
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,920
Shake hands. Okay?

961
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,670
Ten years? Says who?

962
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,340
Ten years, my foot.

963
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,420
You were the one who first said that.

964
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,300
Changwon, I think we should stay quiet.

965
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:29,680
-Why am I always told to stay quiet?
-Have some dumplings.

966
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,970
Thanks.

967
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,810
You knew I liked dumplings?

968
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,290
I'm not criticizing you for taking it.

969
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,460
<i>But you should at least</i>
<i>feel uneasy about it.</i>

970
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,460
<i>You should be aware of what you're doing.</i>

971
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:10,010
When a person loses their home,
their entire world falls apart.

972
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,060
What does she know?

973
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,020
As if I haven't had those thoughts either.

974
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,950
If one thing changes,
everything else related to it changes.

975
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,590
For lawyers, public interest means
defending their client's rights.

976
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,430

Thinking beyond that is arrogance.

979
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,890
He's the most arrogant one.

AS OF TODAY, LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

THE PROCESS OF A MERGER

986

WITH JOHWA, CHUNGGONG, AND HOJEON

987
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,870
A merger?

988
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,670
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

989
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,180
Where did he run off to?

990
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,350
I BELIEVE I'M REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY

991
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,560
THIS IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS

<i>Just be honest.</i>

996
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,080
<i>You remember, don't you?</i>

997
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,040
You're still pretty though.

998
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:37,250
<i>I guess the merger really did happen.</i>

999
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,170
<i>We're all under one roof now.</i>

1000
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,470
<i>Don't get empathize.</i>

1001
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:42,640
You'll lose objectivity
and hinder your work.

1002
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,930
You don't empathize,
because you can't feel anything.

1003
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,470
<i>It's not by choice, okay?</i>

1004
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,270
-Are you really a lawyer?
-It's all on her.

1005
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:54,190
<i>Something feels off.</i>

1006
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,980
<i>Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!</i>
