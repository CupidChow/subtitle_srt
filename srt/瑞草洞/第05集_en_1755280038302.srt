1
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,200
Hi.

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,080
Oh? What brings you here?

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,990
You didn't even call.

4
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,440
Why do you look so startled?

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,320
Were you watching something naughty together?

6
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,990
You should've called before coming.

7
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,880
Did you eat dinner?

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
Probably not.

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,950
- Go and wash your hands.
- Okay.

10
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,510
- Want some snacks?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,420
Snacks? You'll lose your appetite.

12
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,650
Eat dinner first.

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,680
Did I tell you I became a chairman?

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,950
What? Chairman of what?

15
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,800
Some business friends and I started a volunteer organization.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,900
- The chairman of that.
- Whoa...

17
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,000
There he goes bragging about useless things.

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,630
You asked to meet,

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,470
but you're not saying anything. Just like old times.

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,960
Was I like this before, too?

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah, when we broke up.

22
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,540
Why did you want to see me?

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,010
The trial's over.

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,840
Just because...

25
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,950
It's been a while since I saw you, An Ju Hyeong,

26
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,600
but I don't think I actually got to talk to you.

27
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,830
Have you been well?

28
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,550
Yeah.

29
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,090
I've been doing well, as you can tell.

30
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,290
I haven't been well, as you know.

31
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm sorry... about the trial.

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,420
That was the best I could do.

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,300
I thought it'd be good to end it quickly.

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,680
I know.

35
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,360
Ending it fast was the right thing to do.

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,590
For my sake as well.

37
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,840
After how I had hurt you...

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,300
I totally deserve this, don't I?

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
No.

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,180
I didn't think that.

41
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,790
I did think it would've been better if we hadn't met

42
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,250
under such circumstances.

43
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,460
If we had met under different circumstances,

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,530
you wouldn't have even talked to me.

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,690
Park Su Jeong,

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,110
be well.

47
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,590
That's what I came to say.

48
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,970
I used to really like this side of you.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,100
Yeah.

50
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,110
I came to say goodbye, too.

51
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,530
Yeah.

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Let's not see each other again.

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,170
Especially like this.

54
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,620
If something really great happens to you down the line,

55
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,140
just send me a text or something.

56
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,930
I'll be fine.

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,690
Thanks.

58
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,290
Excuse me.

59
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,180
An Ju Hyeong left already.

60
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,230
You should leave now.

61
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,810
Could you come out for a second?

62
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,260
Well, I asked to see you becauseâ€”

63
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,630
Let me speak first.

64
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,530
I turned Park Su Jeong away.

65
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,300
When I went down after what happened yesterday,

66
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,140
she was waiting downstairs.

67
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,790
And I ended up telling her you had already left.

68
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,110
I crossed the line.

69
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,630
I'm sorry. I should've told you right away yesterday.

70
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,710
W-Why... did you do that?

71
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,520
Yeah, why did I do that...

72
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,100
I guess I didn't want you to get hurt.

73
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,800
I didn't think it'd be good for you to see her in that state.

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,930
That's why I did it.

75
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,010
You could get hurt needlessly

76
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,890
for something that's already in the past...

77
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,370
I mean, maybe not for you, I suppose.

78
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,470
So... what I'm trying to say is...

79
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,850
It is in the past.

80
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,290
You were right.

81
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,470
Taking that case was stupid.

82
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,000
I didn't feel at ease with it.

83
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,900
But I'm really okay now.

84
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,940
I wanted to tell you that.

85
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,500
So... you don't have to feel sorry.

86
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,940
I noticed you didn't have any emergency snacks last time,

87
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,360
so I just bought some for you while buying...

88
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,930
buying mine...

89
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,490
Thank you.

90
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,820
Please insert your card.

91
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,270
Choose your transaction.

92
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,580
Reading your card.

93
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,020
Enter the recipient's account number

94
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,820
and press confirm.

95
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,290
Enter the amount

96
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,220
and press confirm.

97
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,570
Transaction complete.

98
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,900
- What the...
- You scared me!

99
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,440
How come you have so much money? You don't spend your salary?

100
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Gosh, why did you sneak a peek at my account?

101
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,820
I'll sue you, I swear.

102
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,330
Sue me? Are we strangers?

103
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,770
- Security!
- Security!

104
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,920
- We have a problem here.
- There's no problem.

105
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,890
- We have a problem here, security!
- No problem at all.

106
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,640
This is good.

107
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,230
Let's have lunch here again in two Tuesdays from now.

108
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,250
Dip it in the salted shrimp. That's the best.

109
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,340
I'll eat it how I want, okay?

110
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,520
And who dips chili peppers in salted shrimp?

111
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh, right.

112
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,140
He's filthy rich. No joke.

113
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,940
It's fake news. Fake news.

114
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,530
It's not fake news.

115
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,240
Why do you still live there when you're so rich?

116
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,380
You should move now.

117
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,270
Did Old Man secretly save up that much money?

118
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,430
How is that secretly?

119
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,220
And I'm not that rich.

120
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,050
But why is Senior Sang Ki called Old Man?

121
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,350
- He acts like one, don't you think?
- Come on!

122
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,590
Not at all. He's an absolute fox.

123
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,090
What was your original nickname?

124
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,060
You probably had one in school.

125
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,300
I was "Spirit of Spring."

126
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,350
Was that supposed to be funny?

127
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,340
It wasn't funny, nor was it touching

128
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,150
or thought provoking.

129
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,870
Hey, you pay for all this.

130
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,210
You're not funny, but you're rich.

131
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,800
- You're crossing the line.
- Hey, aren't you richer, though?

132
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,700
That's my dad's money, not mine.

133
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,390
Your dad is rich?

134
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,820
My dad may be the CEO of a small, high-potential SME,

135
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,360
but he's not that rich.

136
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,350
He made some money as Hanguk Group's subcontractor.

137
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,440
If not for that, he would've gone under already.

138
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,850
How many times do I have to tell you?

139
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,310
I've never heard that before.

140
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,270
In any case, it's all your money in the end, Mr. Only Child.

141
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,810
I'm sick of that "only child" stuff.

142
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,810
Do you want to go up against the 6 million "only child" out there?

143
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,520
And you guys are all doing pretty well.

144
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,660
Who says?

145
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,330
You guys all graduated from law school.

146
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,760
Gosh, that's a dangerous comment.

147
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,300
Not everyone's well-off like you.

148
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,580
Others mistake us as such, but you know that's not the case for us.

149
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,880
Why are you getting so serious, Mr. Big Savings Account?

150
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,840
Geez, why did you have to bring up money?

151
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
You did, Attorney Jo.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,280
Yeah, I was talking to myself.

153
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,590
This damn mouth of mine.

154
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,580
My mouth is the problem.

155
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,550
Your symptoms haven't improved.

156
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,640
I couldn't take the meds you prescribed because I got pregnant.

157
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,070
Really? Congratulations.

158
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,020
Your husband must've been thrilled.

159
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm not sure yetâ€¦

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,860
I don't know if it's something to celebrate.

161
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,280
Then, I'll prescribe something safe for pregnancy.

162
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,210
Retail investors are idiots.

163
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,860
As soon as the price goes up a little,

164
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
they swarm in like rabid dogs.

165
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,500
Are you talking about me?

166
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,020
- You were a retail investor?
- Yes, of course!

167
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,820
Oh, shit.

168
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,170
That's hilarious.

169
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,930
Sorry about that.

170
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,950
- Anyway...
- Yeah?

171
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,460
As soon as trading resumes, we dump all our shares.

172
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,470
But these retail investors just gobble them up.

173
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,280
So, we make capital gains,

174
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,570
while that stock plummets into penny-stock territory.

175
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,960
Then, we do another capital reduction, rake in capital gains,

176
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,430
and repeat this cycle until the company gets delisted.

177
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,730
So, that's how I lost my money.

178
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,000
It seems like all my money went to you.

179
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,500
Do you want to partner up when I get out?

180
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,040
I'll make you rich.

181
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,250
I appreciate the thought, but I'll pass.

182
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,750
If I'm meant to make money, it'll come my way.

183
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,540
Otherwise, I'll lose my license.

184
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,070
What will you do with your precious attorney license?

185
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,560
Dammit, you're just here as an errand boy to chat with me.

186
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,740
I get to run my mouth and get paid for it.

187
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,190
I'd say that's a win.

188
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,990
Don't you think?

189
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,500
- You're totally nuts, huh?
- Huh?

190
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,410
This is why I like you, Attorney.

191
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,500
Thank you.

192
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,030
Mr. Seong,

193
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,740
how long do I have to go on these visitations?

194
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,450
Do you know how much we're being paid for those visitations?

195
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,110
If you can bring in that much business, I'll tell you.

196
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,870
Or...

197
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,750
if you get your father's company to sign an advisory retainer,

198
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,070
I'll take you off the visitation case.

199
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,130
- Never mind.
- The trial won't take long, so just keep doing it.

200
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,160
You don't have to go every day. Maybe every other day.

201
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,880
Okay, I understand.

202
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,910
Isn't this easier for you anyway?

203
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,220
You just go and hang out.

204
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,770
If I were you, I'd say, "Thank you very much" and be on my way.

205
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,500
This isn't theft. It's technically misappropriation of lost property.

206
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,310
I honestly don't remember anything.

207
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,750
Did you drink a lot that night?

208
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,770
My job-hunting wasn't going well,

209
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,440
so I went out with some friends to blow off steam.

210
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,110
I guess I went overboard.

211
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,010
Do you remember going to the convenience store?

212
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,700
I don't remember that, either,

213
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,290
but when I get drunk, I usually go there to grab one last beer.

214
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,280
So, I probably went there, but...

215
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,880
the police say the CCTV footage shows

216
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,830
that I took the watch that was there.

217
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,630
But if you took it, it should be at your house.

218
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,300
But there's nothing.

219
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,750
That's what's driving me crazy.

220
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,500
If it were at home, I could at least apologize and say

221
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,790
I mistakenly took it while drunk.

222
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,100
But that's not the case.

223
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,000
Then, at the police interview, don't accept the charges.

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Just tell them honestly that you don't remember anything.

225
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,960
But what if they think I'm lying and punish me more harshly?

226
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,180
During the police investigation,

227
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,660
they may or may not show you the CCTV footage.

228
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,000
If you say you don't remember, they'll probably show you video evidence.

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,970
It's not too late to admit guilt, then.

230
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,360
I really didn't hit them.

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,870
In over 10 years of teaching,

232
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,930
I've never used corporal punishment.

233
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,940
Are these the students' names?

234
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,790
No, they filed the complaint under the parents' names.

235
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,080
Then, do you know which kids filed the complaint?

236
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,650
Yes, I know who they are.

237
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,070
They were using the gym after school without permission,

238
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,350
so I scolded them.

239
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,550
A few days later, I got a call from the police,

240
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,140
saying I was being sued for child abuse.

241
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,900
But are seventh graders even considered children?

242
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,950
Yes, anyone under 18 is considered a child.

243
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,290
So, you're saying you only gave them a warning

244
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,320
and didn't physically discipline them. Right?

245
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,710
Yes.

246
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,750
But it says you made them get into the push-up position

247
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,320
and hit their bottoms.

248
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,470
I never did that.

249
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,350
When the police called me,

250
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,070
I wondered if I'd been too harsh with my words.

251
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,550
But when I read the complaint,

252
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,360
I was shocked by their claims.

253
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,690
I only scold students verbally.

254
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,790
Gently.

255
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,250
I see. Could you tell me the students' names?

256
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,200
I feel like they'll be on here...

257
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,270
Geez, I told you to knock!

258
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,410
Do you have a Newstagram account?

259
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,310
Huh?

260
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,500
Why don't you create your own account and check?

261
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,380
Why are you making me do it?

262
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,720
It's a hassle. I don't know the system, either.

263
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,400
And who has the time to read all the terms and conditions?

264
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,870
- Why would you read that?
- That's how you sign up.

265
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,900
Who knows what might be included there?

266
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,360
You're nuts.

267
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,740
Hwang Min Gu.

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,800
He really didn't hit them, right?

269
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,480
So, what now?

270
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Ride the wave.

271
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,310
What?

272
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,530
You know, "Friend-of-a-friend" feature. Wave surfing.

273
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,060
Friend-of-a-friend...

274
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,930
It's not "Wave." It's "Follow."

275
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,430
But I don't think those kids would've followed him.

276
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,180
Try Kim Sang Jun.

277
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,830
Nothing.

278
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,900
Nothing.

279
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,950
There's nothing.

280
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,770
Nothing. Damn it.

281
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,350
Then...

282
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,200
Then,

283
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,540
we can try this.

284
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,760
First, let's look for a student from this school.

285
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,180
Teacher, let's go here for our next school picnic.

286
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,640
_yea.na14.

287
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,090
She's probably in seventh grade.

288
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,520
Gosh, how should we respond?

289
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,420
There doesn't seem to be...

290
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,610
any boys on here.

291
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,460
She seems popular.

292
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,090
There are boys on here.

293
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,120
Joo An?

294
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,920
These are boys' profiles.

295
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,950
Wait.

296
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,870
- sangjuuun_kim?
- Kim Sang Jun.

297
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,610
Is this him?

298
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,630
I found him.

299
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,070
If you mess with us, you're done for.

300
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,300
How dare you nag us?

301
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,660
Bye-bye, Mr. Min Gu.

302
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,670
That's what you get for mouthing off.

303
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,740
Goodness.

304
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,860
eeeeminhyuk and others liked this post.

305
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,710
Lee Min Hyuk, Im Gi Hun... It's them, right?

306
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,560
Lee Min Hyeok, Im Gi Hun, Jang Seong Bin...

307
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,520
It is them.

308
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,740
Damn it, you found them.

309
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,010
- Yeah.
- Geez...

310
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,640
Then, I have to actually visit.

311
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,170
Do you want to come with me?

312
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,950
I'm leaving. Damn it...

313
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,980
Fighting.

314
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
Pass! Pass! Hey, pass!

315
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,590
Kim Sang Jun,

316
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,750
Lee Min Hyeok,

317
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,020
Im Gi Hun,

318
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,620
let's see... Jang Seong Bin,

319
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,210
and Kang Jae Ho.

320
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,170
Now that I see your faces, it is you guys.

321
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,370
Who are you, mister?

322
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,030
You're not allowed in here.

323
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,870
The same goes for you guys.

324
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,280
Kim Sang Jun, are you the ringleader?

325
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,590
How do you know my name?

326
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,840
You guys falsely accused Mr. Hwang Min Gu, right?

327
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,600
That's not true. We filed charges because he really did hit us.

328
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,720
Give me a second.

329
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,000
If you mess with us, you're done for.

330
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,560
How dare you nag us?

331
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,790
Bye-bye, Mr. Min Gu.

332
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,890
That's what you get for mouthing off.

333
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,290
Guys,

334
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,270
if you're going to commit a crime, you can't be dumb.

335
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,690
If you're this sloppy now, what will you do later?

336
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,940
You can't prove that our claims are lies with just that.

337
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,370
Well, you see, I don't have to prove that.

338
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,740
I just have to demonstrate that there's

339
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,300
reasonable doubt that Mr. Hwang hit you.

340
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,610
Even harsh words are a form of verbal punishment.

341
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,190
Then, you should've filed charges on that.

342
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,700
Why did you say he made you get into the push-up position and hit your bottom?

343
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,400
The gym was made for students to use. So, they should allow it.

344
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,490
Forbidding us from using it is unfair.

345
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,000
Then, you should've submitted a formal complaint

346
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
through the appropriate agency.

347
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,440
You can't make a false accusation. That's a serious crime.

348
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,660
What's that?

349
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,820
We're juveniles.

350
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,230
Oh, juveniles...

351
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,310
Then, you should've filed the charges under your names.

352
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,780
Why did you file under your parents' names and make them criminals?

353
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,730
And juveniles still get tried in juvenile court.

354
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,340
Community service, probation,

355
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,900
placement in custodial care, or put in a juvenile center.

356
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,830
Though I'm not sure which sentence you'll receive yet.

357
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,360
How did you even find my account?

358
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,710
There's no way you found that out yourself.

359
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,230
Why do you think that?

360
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,810
You don't look like you'd even know what Newstagram is.

361
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,020
That's harsh.

362
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,000
Do you guys know "Friend-of-a-friend" surfing?

363
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,270
- What's that?
- Don't know.

364
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,020
It's winter. Why would we go surfing?

365
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,950
I know. This guy is weird.

366
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,760
I know.

367
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,600
Saying you don't remember won't cut it.

368
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,190
He's not just saying that. He really doesn't remember.

369
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,240
You can't answer for him, Attorney.

370
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,810
You know that.

371
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,100
I really don't remember, and there's nothing at my house, either.

372
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,420
Then, I'll show you the CCTV footage.

373
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,440
Watch it and tell me how much you recall.

374
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,520
Both of you, come here.

375
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,210
Here.

376
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,720
The victim leaves the convenience store.

377
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,110
You see the small shopping bag in his right hand?

378
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,020
Are you saying the watch was in there?

379
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,700
Yes.

380
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,360
But shortly after, Moon Dong Geun enters the store.

381
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,020
Then, the victim suddenly gets up and leaves,

382
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,590
forgetting the shopping bag.

383
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,030
Then, Moon Dong Geun comes out and sits there.

384
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,640
Okay. Then, Moon Dong Geun gets up and leaves, too.

385
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,730
Soon after, the victim comes back.

386
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,350
But by then, the shopping bag is gone.

387
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,100
And he immediately reports it to the police.

388
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,130
You were the only person there during that time, Moon Dong Geun.

389
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,920
I can only conclude that you took the bag in your backpack.

390
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,230
But the footage doesn't show the exact spot.

391
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,840
Attorney, you saw the shopping bag sitting there. Right?

392
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,310
Did anyone come by during that time besides Moon Dong Geun?

393
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,740
I mean, how can you refute this?

394
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,380
Yeah, Mom. I just finished my interview.

395
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,900
Well, I don't know.

396
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,710
Yeah, I ate.

397
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,060
Yeah.

398
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,930
Okay, hang up. Okay.

399
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,290
I told her I was going to a job interview.

400
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,080
That convenience store is nearby, right?

401
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,720
What are you looking for?

402
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,650
When CCTV cameras are installed, they must be reported.

403
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,620
The police probably only had footage from reported CCTV cameras.

404
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,050
If reporting is mandatory,

405
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,360
that means there could be CCTVs that weren't reported.

406
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,970
That teacher is ridiculous.

407
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,930
How could he hire an attorney as if he's in the right?

408
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,490
The same goes for you. You're an attorney.

409
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,770
How could you go visit the kids and do that?

410
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,210
I mean, if you met the kids, that should be enough.

411
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,590
Why are you making us come in as well?

412
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,090
Because you're the plaintiffs.

413
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,590
Neither the teacher nor the attorney acts like a proper adult.

414
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,840
So, what do you want to say to us?

415
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,180
We're all busy people.

416
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,350
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

417
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,550
I'm Attorney Bae Mun Jeong of Hyungmin Law Group.

418
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,400
- What's up?
- You look outnumbered.

419
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,700
So what will you do? Will you maintain the charges?

420
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,420
They said they were hit because they were.

421
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,590
Why would they say that if they weren't hit?

422
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,250
And what? False accusation?

423
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,960
Do you have evidence?

424
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,590
I don't think you'd be able to prove it.

425
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,970
You're Im Gi Hun's father, right?

426
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,010
Yes. How did you know that?

427
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,630
You're saying the same thing your son did.

428
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,590
You can't prove that our claims are lies with just that.

429
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,750
The kids have all admitted to it now,

430
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,860
but if the parents keep playing ignorant,

431
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,790
we'll have to consider ways to hold you all accountable.

432
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,870
The kids lied. Why are you holding us responsible? Huh?

433
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,810
None of us knew this was a false accusation!

434
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,460
- This was the kids' doing!
- We didn't know!

435
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,990
Seriously!

436
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,620
I asked my relative, who is a chief prosecutor,

437
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,860
and he said if I didn't know, I wouldn't be punished.

438
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,290
So, you're saying it's your kid's fault, not yours. Right?

439
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,810
Yes.

440
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,180
Have you heard of this saying?

441
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,010
"Law is the minimum standard of morality."

442
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,550
There's this in civil law.

443
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,890
It's called supervisory responsibility.

444
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,860
Parents of minors

445
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,260
have a legal responsibility as supervisors.

446
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,390
That's the minimum duty as a parent.

447
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,500
But you say that kids did it, and you didn't know?

448
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,240
If you won't take ethical responsibility as parents,

449
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,750
then you must bear legal responsibility as supervisors.

450
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,360
Oh my.

451
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,520
Then, what can we do to make this better?

452
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,420
Since you're attorneys, give us some advice.

453
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,660
We are attorneys for Mr. Hwang Min Gu.

454
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,350
We're not the plaintiffs' counsel.

455
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,910
First, you should drop the lawsuit.

456
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,850
After that, it's up to what Mr. Hwang decides.

457
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,810
What would you like to do?

458
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,510
Hey, why did you get so worked up today?

459
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,950
You scared me.

460
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,610
I couldn't stand the sight of them showing up in droves

461
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,580
without realizing they were in the wrong.

462
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,950
We have to live with our heads on straight

463
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,390
so we don't become parents like that.

464
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,740
So, what time and where should we meet later?

465
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,790
I'll send you a text.

466
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,110
- Should we call Kang Hui Ji, too?
- Sure. I'll tell her.

467
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,380
You tell Ji Seok.

468
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,380
You do it. He's your husband.

469
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,120
He's your friend, Attorney.

470
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,130
I'm Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

471
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,610
Geez, I still can't let you. No.

472
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,180
We'll just check that brief time slot.

473
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,080
You're an attorney. Don't you know the law?

474
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,770
We can't just show stuff like this without the police.

475
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,880
No, if the person in the footage requests it,

476
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,740
you have to show it.

477
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,740
Gosh, seriously.

478
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,490
I feel strange telling you this since we just met.

479
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,420
But I have a criminal record.

480
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,190
So, I'm trying my best to live within the legal boundaries.

481
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,670
So, talk to the police,

482
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,740
and if they say to show it to you, I will.

483
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,450
Otherwise, I can't. You got that?

484
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,870
Please leave.

485
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,320
Sir!

486
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,490
What should we do, Attorney?

487
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,060
Are you sure the watch isn't at your house?

488
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,450
Yes.

489
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,830
Then, let's check this with the police.

490
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,170
But what if...

491
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,450
we check the footage,

492
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,640
and it turns out I really did take it?

493
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,380
- It doesn't smell much.
- It does.

494
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,760
I washed it in the washing machine.

495
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,170
Anyway...

496
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,980
- Fine. Good job. Smells like it.
- Really?

497
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,690
Please get us another glass.

498
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,270
Hui Ji can't make it.

499
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,460
Seems she's busy with work.

500
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,240
Oh, really?

501
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

502
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,740
You never ask for favors.

503
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,660
Why did you call me out in the middle of the night?

504
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,680
That's why I'm buying dinner now.

505
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,200
You live close by anyway.

506
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,740
Exactly. I told you to visit since I live nearby,

507
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,630
but you never came once.

508
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,920
Drinking with you is no fun.

509
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,070
It's no fun at all.

510
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,740
Y-You're... funny...

511
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,500
Outrageous.

512
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,230
Why aren't you eating much today?

513
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,590
What? I just don't have much of an appetite.

514
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,490
Really? What in the world?

515
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,630
Hey, did you hear from Ju Hwan?

516
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,290
He said he's being sued, so I gave him your number.

517
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,940
Yeah, I said I'd handle it.

518
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,700
You did? That's not like you.

519
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,270
You don't handle cases for people you know.

520
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,550
Yeah. We're not close. I only know his name.

521
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,500
Do you tell people that you're close to me?

522
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,980
I don't tell people we're close, but don't cause any trouble.

523
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,400
I won't take your case.

524
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,760
My wife's an attorney. Why would I ask you? Right?

525
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,250
I'd be glad if he's even capable of causing trouble.

526
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,990
No fun.

527
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,890
Both of you are hurting me as a tag team.

528
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,250
Hey, haven't you been on any blind dates lately?

529
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm busy.

530
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,470
What do you mean you're busy?

531
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,110
You even went to the school to meet those kids!

532
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,540
I went for work, not for fun.

533
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,120
School? Why would he go to a school?

534
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,480
Well, there were these kids

535
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,170
who falsely accused a teacher of corporal punishment.

536
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,880
Whoa, scary. So scary.

537
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
It's too scary to raise kids these days.

538
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,170
So, did it get resolved?

539
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,980
Yeah, I think so.

540
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,920
It's a relief.

541
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,640
What are you relieved about?

542
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,810
Well, it means my client wasn't a bad person.

543
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,400
Why is that important to you?

544
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,160
I'd prefer my client to be a good person.

545
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,590
Who are you?

546
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,890
Who are you? Are you ill?

547
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,460
- He's weird.
- He's always been weird.

548
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,690
He's weirder today.

549
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,540
I think you're right.

550
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,180
I'm so full.

551
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,420
Thanks for dinner.

552
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,520
- Thanks for dinner.
- See you.

553
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,500
It's such a relief that my client isn't a bad person.

554
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,810
I'd prefer him to be a good person.

555
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,420
I'd prefer my client to be a good person.

556
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,200
Gosh, seriously.

557
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,770
Attorney.

558
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,290
Do you want me to tell you something interesting?

559
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,810
- What is it?
- Do you know why

560
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,870
my dad assigned you to me?

561
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,760
Well, to keep you company, I suppose.

562
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,310
I'm telling you, you're so funny.

563
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,530
You're so naive.

564
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,680
He assigned you to keep an eye on me.

565
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,350
In case I'd rat that old man out.

566
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,440
- Pardon?
- Where do you think I got the money?

567
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,890
It's all that old man's.

568
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,200
But he's such a scaredy-cat.

569
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,400
Why would I rat out my dad? I'll be out soon anyway.

570
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,130
I've looked at the case records.

571
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,590
It doesn't look like you'll be out anytime soon.

572
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,100
Do you want to bet? Whether I get out soon or not?

573
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,960
I shouldn't be telling anyone about this.

574
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,010
It's a multi-million won tip.

575
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,370
You see, the stock-manipulation cases

576
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,620
are about to whom the unjust gainâ€”

577
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,640
No, never mind.

578
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,730
When I get out, do you want to work for me?

579
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,670
I'll tell you then.

580
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,460
I mean, you're already getting paid to hang out with me.

581
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,510
You can stop pretending to be an attorney

582
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,610
and just play with me while working for me.

583
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,600
I think that would be fun.

584
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,980
Why on earth would I work for you, Jang Su Gil?

585
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,780
What's with that look?

586
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,990
Does glaring at me with prideful eyes make things better?

587
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,950
Why would I assert my pride in front of a lowlife like you?

588
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,330
You're not getting out. Not in 10 or 20 years. Got that, asshole?

589
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,220
You can't even get out of here. What the...

590
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,760
Who the hell are you to tell me to work for you?

591
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,970
If I'm a lowlife,

592
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,180
what does that make you, coming here to keep me entertained?

593
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,130
You'll be back here in a few days anyway.

594
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,550
Don't assert your pride.

595
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,900
It'll only eat you up inside.

596
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,260
Thank you, Attorney.

597
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,400
I'll do my best to teach the kids well.

598
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,080
- A girl you're flirting with?
- Geez, you scared me.

599
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,840
- Why smile while reading a text?
- You're wrong.

600
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,700
Let's go.

601
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,550
- Is it really a girl you're flirting with?
- No, no. Let's go.

602
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,800
Enjoy your meal.

603
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,960
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

604
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,030
What are you having?

605
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,520
We'll have Chinese spicy soup.

606
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,740
Chinese spicy soup sounds good.

607
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,320
What are we having?

608
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm not sure.

609
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,140
Hey, are you heading out to eat?

610
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,380
Of course.

611
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,980
Aren't we eating together?

612
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,940
I think I'll have to eat separately today.

613
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,470
You didn't say that in the group chat.

614
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,260
Why argue about it? She must have something to do.

615
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,450
- I mean...
- An Ju Hyeong.

616
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,240
I have a life, too.

617
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,400
- I'll get going.
- Okay, see you later.

618
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,300
- Make sure to eat.
- Okay!

619
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
What is it?

620
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,250
As I thought...

621
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,420
What?

622
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,660
Naengmyeon* sounds good.
(Cold noodles with vinegar*, also used to mean jealousy)

623
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,200
- Okay, naengmyeon.
- Today's a naengmyeon day.

624
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah, naengmyeon.

625
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,030
Enjoy your meal.

626
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,650
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

627
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,380
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

628
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,420
Yes, thank you. Come again.

629
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,510
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

630
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,620
Sir, the black bean noodles are really good.

631
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,360
Our black soybean paste sauce isn't just any black soybean paste.

632
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,550
But I still can't show you the CCTV footage.

633
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,700
I'll only check the part with my client. That'll be enough.

634
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,000
I've explained enough already. Bring the police with you.

635
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,960
Gosh, this is tasty.

636
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,170
Thank you.

637
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,340
- Hey, pull that in a bit.
- Gosh, seriously.

638
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,180
Nice. That's good.

639
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,350
But who eats cold noodles in the middle of winter?

640
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,160
It's originally a cold region dish.

641
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,550
I bet people there don't eat cold noodles in the winter.

642
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,680
You don't even drink iced Americanos when it's cold, but you'll eat this?

643
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,280
Mun Jeong strongly wanted to eat it.

644
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,240
She always strongly wants to eat.

645
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,830
Then, why didn't you order beef short rib soup?

646
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,530
Why do you always complain every time we eat?

647
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,700
How can I get beef short rib soup when everyone is having cold noodles?

648
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,680
That's true.

649
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,470
One order of cold noodles with broth for this table.

650
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,270
Yes, yes.

651
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,210
Hello?

652
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,450
Yeah, Hyung.

653
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,760
Yeah, I'm part of Hyungmin Law Group.

654
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,620
Kang Hui Ji?

655
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,450
Yeah, I know Hui Ji well. Why?

656
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,820
Hey, I called you to stop this attorney from coming here.

657
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,830
- But you come with her?
- What's wrong?

658
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,440
It's nice to see you again.

659
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,950
You two must be really close.

660
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,740
- I'm a regular here.
- He always brings girls here to impress them.

661
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,970
That's how he became a regular.

662
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,800
Hyung! Why would you say that? She'll misunderstand!

663
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,260
Huh? Why are you getting flustered? Trying to impress her?

664
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,670
What are you saying? This guy's weird.

665
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,640
But how do you impress girls here?

666
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,100
Well, you see...

667
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,850
- That's a trade secret.
- What a load of crap.

668
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,530
I can't let you see it.

669
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,590
But since you came with Chang Won, enjoy your meal.

670
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,890
I'll give you cream shrimp on the house.

671
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,790
Thank you. I'll come often.

672
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

673
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,060
- See you later.
- See you.

674
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,150
Goodness, sorry for the wait.

675
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,430
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

676
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,800
This is good.

677
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,500
They're really making me uncomfortable.

678
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,410
It's burned.

679
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,480
If you burn it like this, I can't post a picture.

680
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,550
- I meanâ€”
- Leave that one out.

681
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,510
It got burned because I was waiting for you.

682
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,950
This one doesn't look tasty, either.

683
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,020
- Put a new one on for me. Just one.
- Okay, okay.

684
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,940
- A new one. Nice.
- It's frozen.

685
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,550
The lighting's good. Got it.

686
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,780
- You're good now?
- Okay, okay.

687
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,730
Oops, my bad.

688
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,730
- Is this revenge?
- I'm eating the burned ones for you.

689
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,510
All right.

690
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,890
Here's your fried rice.

691
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,850
All right, enjoy your meal.

692
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,120
Don't smile.

693
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,250
Come on.

694
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,860
I think it'd work with one more visit.

695
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,210
Right? With one more visit, we might throw up.

696
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,150
Gosh, this damn convenience store table.

697
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,280
Why did he have to leave it here?

698
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,750
Still, you're such a hard worker.

699
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,260
Sorry for dragging you into this.

700
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,700
Oh, no.

701
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,110
Following you makes me feel like I'm working hard,

702
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,120
so it's fun. I like it.

703
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,410
Really?

704
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,750
Then, does this seem like interesting work?

705
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,940
You said you wanted to do something exciting and worthwhile.

706
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,570
Well, it seems way better than my work.

707
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:53,530
I guess being an attorney doesn't suit me.

708
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,220
Why not? You're the most energetic guy at our firm.

709
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,030
I'm only enjoying myself because you guys are there.

710
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,090
The job itself... I'm not sure about it.

711
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,330
Still, if you don't want to be an attorney,

712
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,130
you could always inherit your dad's business.

713
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,390
Gosh, seriously.

714
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,820
That's my dad's company, not mine.

715
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

716
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,870
What about you? You said your dad also runs a business.

717
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,880
Yeah.

718
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,770
Just a moment.

719
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,670
Yeah, Dad.

720
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,220
No, I didn't forget. We talked about it last time.

721
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,850
Oh, next Friday?

722
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,440
Got it.

723
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Okay.

724
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,280
What is it? Something happening next Friday?

725
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,900
Yeah. My parents' memorial service.

726
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,230
What?

727
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,380
What? What's the matter?

728
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,730
I mean, just now on the phone,

729
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,260
didn't you call him "D-Dad"?

730
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,960
Yeah, I was talking to my dad.

731
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,010
Then, it's your mom's memorial?

732
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,090
No, for both of my parents.

733
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,650
What?

734
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,900
My parents passed away when I was seven.

735
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,330
My aunt and uncle raised me.

736
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,180
So, my uncle is now my dad.

737
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,000
I see.

738
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,100
Then...

739
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,640
your dad, who runs a business, is the uncle you were just talking to...

740
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,380
No, no, I mean, he's your dad.

741
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,980
Wait, no. You said your dad passed away,

742
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,410
so...

743
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,300
It's really difficult, right? You don't have to say anything.

744
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,960
No, I feel like...

745
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,810
I should still s-say something.

746
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,350
No, no, just be quiet.

747
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,580
- Can I?
- Yeah, just stay still.

748
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,630
I'm fine.

749
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,980
Thanks.

750
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,500
We've narrowed down to five scholarship recipients this year.

751
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,730
Four 12th graders and one exam retaker.

752
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,410
This student's family income fluctuates every year.

753
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,000
Let's do another background check to make sure

754
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,500
they didn't under-report before making a final decision.

755
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,790
Yes, understood.

756
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,930
Executive Director, Lee Dong Su, one of the first-year recipients...

757
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,700
Him again?

758
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,290
What about the victim?

759
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,790
They haven't hired an attorney yet, right?

760
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,110
Yes, it seems they are representing themselves.

761
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,330
Should we pay the victim for their legal fees again?

762
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,370
No.

763
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,750
This time, let's not just pay for their attorney fees.

764
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,080
Let's bring them here.

765
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,150
This is the Hyungmin Law Group, after all.

766
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,960
We'll have the attorneys here represent them.

767
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,920
I've always wanted to do that once I opened my own firm.

768
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,950
Okay, understood.

769
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,890
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Welcomeâ€”

770
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,920
Gosh, seriously.

771
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,400
I'm so sick and tired of this.

772
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,620
Are you sure it's okay to show it to you?

773
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,870
That's right! It's fine as long as you don't show me other people.

774
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,400
Have that guy come, too.

775
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,060
- He lives around here, right?
- Yes!

776
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,030
You better take responsibility if I get in trouble for this.

777
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:54,130
Come on, Hyung. We're attorneys.

778
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,070
- I have a criminal record.
- I'll defend you.

779
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,530
Deal.

780
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,530
Why'd you do that?

781
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,400
I can't even get a job,

782
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,450
and I stole someone's stuff after getting drunk.

783
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,130
Wow, I'm such a scumbag.

784
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,290
What do I do now, Attorney?

785
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,580
Act like you don't know anything.

786
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,220
That's how I should advise you as an attorney.

787
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,930
It won't be easy to prove you did it with only the police's CCTV footage.

788
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,720
But...

789
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,310
if I were your older sister,

790
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,630
I'd tell you to take that footage straight to the police station.

791
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,610
If you call yourself a scumbag for failing to get a job

792
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,290
and stealing someone else's stuff,

793
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,750
how will you live with yourself if you actually become a scumbag

794
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,960
by covering it up and lying?

795
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,640
It doesn't change your wrongdoing just because you're cleared of charges.

796
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,760
Estimation is about 68% of sales.

797
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,980
What the... Why are you all here like you planned it?

798
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,240
Oh?

799
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,580
Don't tell me you guys met without me.

800
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,120
We just happened to run into each other.

801
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,870
- You mean that, right?
- Is this kimbap?

802
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,980
I've been eating too much greasy food lately. I needed something spicy.

803
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,240
Eat up, man.

804
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,310
Spicy...

805
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,820
chili pepper kimbap.

806
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,230
Spicy chili pepper kimbap?

807
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,060
You got two rolls. Give me one.

808
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,920
Hands off! This is for Hui Ji.

809
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,690
I thought she might need it, too.

810
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,110
But Mun Jeong needs one, too.

811
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,880
What about Sang Ki?

812
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,850
Get one for yourself.

813
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,060
Since we're all here,

814
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,600
let's set a date to hang out since it's been a while.

815
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,350
How's next Friday?

816
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,000
- I'm available.
- Sounds good to me, too.

817
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,880
I'm free,

818
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,350
but Hui Ji probably won't be.

819
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,500
- Really?
- How do you know that?

820
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,760
I just do.

821
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,440
Because she needs to obtain the CCTV footage?

822
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,780
That's over now, but...

823
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,920
there's a reason for it.

824
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,960
Okay, then, how about tonight?

825
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,320
Tonight works for me, too.

826
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,900
- Me, too.
- That probably won't work, either.

827
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,040
- For you or for Hui Ji?
- For both of us.

828
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,800
Geez, when do we get together, then?

829
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,020
Hey, you said you've got a trial.

830
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,570
- Just go for now.
- Okay.

831
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,140
I'll just post a poll in the group chat.

832
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,100
This is Mun Jeong's case, but I'm doing a part-time job

833
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,690
for 10,000 won.

834
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,890
Hey, hey, hey! I said that's for Hui Ji!

835
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,190
What's wrong with that jerk?

836
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,950
Gosh, I can't do this. Seriously.

837
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,540
Bae Mun Jeong, take this back.

838
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,270
I can't do this for just 10,000 won, seriously.

839
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,400
Why not, Attorney?

840
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,390
How could you ask me to summarize 150 pages for just 10,000 won?

841
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,220
- No refunds.
- Give me 10,000 won more.

842
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
- Please buy me spicy chili pepper kimbap.
- Just 10,000 won more.

843
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,960
- Just 10,000 won more.
- Here.

844
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,530
- Yes, Managing Partner.
- You don't have court today, right?

845
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,830
- No.
- I heard my kid got hurt, so I rushed out.

846
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,440
I was so rushed that I forgot I had court today.

847
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,880
Could you fill in for me?

848
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,250
Sure, will do.

849
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,160
What time is the hearing?

850
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,020
At 4:00 p.m.

851
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,680
Oh, b-but it's 3:50 p.m. right now.

852
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,880
If you run fast, you could make it.

853
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,550
Let me hang up for now.

854
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,630
Sorry about that.

855
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,430
Shit.

856
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,560
- The files.
- Thank you.

857
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,960
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!

858
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,910
Excuse me!

859
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,820
Is the plaintiff, Pungcheon Trading, present?

860
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,360
Plaintiff? Pungcheon Trading?

861
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,520
- Yes, I'm here.
- Please come to the front.

862
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,010
Defendant Segi International?

863
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,030
Yes.

864
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,020
All right. The plaintiff submitted their brief yesterday.

865
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,890
We'll begin as soon as everyone is ready.

866
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,670
Hello, this is Ohn OB/GYN.

867
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,930
For appointments or inquiries...

868
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,380
Hello, this is Ohn OB/GYN.

869
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,430
Hello. Can I make an appointment?

870
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,030
The Chinese restaurant across the street?

871
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,270
Yes, there's a private CCTV there.

872
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,770
It captured everything with no blind spots.

873
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,430
Really?

874
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,530
Then, who was the culprit?

875
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,300
- It was me.
- Pardon?

876
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,330
Yes, it turned out my client had taken it.

877
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,050
I see.

878
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,290
Then, we'll discuss what to do about this.

879
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,480
We can take this as a surrender.

880
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,010
But I really don't know where the watch is.

881
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,250
I don't remember. I might've dropped it somewhere.

882
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,040
I'll compensate for it somehow.

883
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,150
Okay, I'll talk to the victim about that.

884
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Don't worry too much.

885
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,910
I heard it wasn't that expensive.

886
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,790
Oh, I see. Thank you.

887
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,670
I guess you didn't tell your mom that you had a job interview today.

888
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,210
No.

889
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,670
What did you tell her?

890
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,660
I told her I was going to the police station.

891
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,780
Good.

892
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,060
Thank you, Attorney.

893
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,000
From now on, just call me "noona".

894
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,320
Since you listened to my advice as a sister, not as an attorney.

895
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,690
Okay.

896
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,550
Let's go.

897
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,620
I'm treating you to thank you. I'll grill the meat.

898
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,360
I'm grilling so I can eat faster.

899
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,580
When I heard everyone went to a barbecue without us last time,

900
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,080
I got so hurt.

901
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,590
Because you were so upset about it, I'm buying you a barbecue today.

902
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,300
I felt like you missed out because of me.

903
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,980
Still, everything turned out well.

904
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,140
That guy is more courageous than he looks.

905
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,780
Yeah. You're right.

906
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,550
This one's done. Eat it.

907
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,820
Thank you.

908
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,740
Oh, wait, wait.

909
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,400
Ma'am, one bottle of soju, please.

910
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,900
I really don't want to go to work.

911
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,860
Why?

912
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,720
This guy I hate...

913
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,000
I told him off as if I'd never see him again.

914
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,300
But I have to go see him again soon. That could even be tomorrow.

915
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,130
You must hate it.

916
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,180
You understood what I just said?

917
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,150
Not exactly...

918
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:40,410
but seems like you don't want to talk more about it.

919
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,450
Actually...

920
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,350
I've been doing visitation work recently.

921
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,570
- Visitation work?
- Yeah.

922
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,410
I'm not even legally representing him

923
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,930
but I have to go in every day to chat with him. It's exhausting.

924
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,850
How could they make you do that?

925
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:11,330
No wonder you've been looking serious at times lately.

926
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,510
- How long do you have to do this?
- I don't know.

927
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,290
Not knowing that is the worst part.

928
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,420
Cheers.

929
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,640
Should we order another spicy cold noodles?

930
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,100
Yes. Ma'am, one more spicy cold noodles, please.

931
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,800
Okay.

932
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:07,890
Excuse me. We'd like to order, please.

933
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,580
- Over here, please.
- Okay.

934
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,120
All right...

935
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,330
As you get older, you need something hot like this in your stomach.

936
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,300
You shouldn't eat cold food like this.

937
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,540
I've been coming here for years.

938
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,800
Please enjoy.

939
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,210
- Okay.
- Yes. Thank you for the food.

940
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,440
Anyway, it's great that our firm has grown in size and our sales are up,

941
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,540
thanks to you.

942
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,230
Thank you so much!

943
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,550
- Don't mention it.
- Yes.

944
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,430
The meat is cooked really well. It's cooked well.

945
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,170
- Here, try this.
- Oh, thank you.

946
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,890
Thank you.

947
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,340
So, why did you ask to see us today?

948
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,050
I'm a bit busy.

949
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,320
Oh, yes.

950
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,530
Since you're all busy,

951
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,840
I should get right to it.

952
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,560
I'd like to ask you to take a case.

953
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,410
It's not my personal case.

954
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:13,650
I'm just introducing the case to you, so don't feel too pressured.

955
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,970
- A legal representation?
- Yes.

956
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:23,370
Out of all of you, I'd like two people to handle it.

957
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:27,210
Since Ms. Kim Ryu Jin said she's busy...

958
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:32,310
and Mr. Seong Yu Deok said business is going well already,

959
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:38,540
I'd like Mr. Na Kyeong Min and Ms. Kang Jeong Yun to handle this case.

960
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,200
Us?

961
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,800
I wasn't saying our business was going that great.

962
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,820
- So, you're talking two cases?
- No, just one case.

963
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,020
One case? Then, why do you need both of us?

964
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,260
I'd like the two of you to co-counsel this case.

965
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,180
That's the only condition I have for this case.

966
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,410
I'm all for collaboration.

967
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,830
I see, Mr. Seong. That's all right.

968
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,610
Now that we're all in one firm, let's use this opportunity to work together.

969
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,970
That way, I'll see the benefit of merging.

970
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,050
Together?

971
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,290
Think it over while you eat.

972
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,600
- How come you're not eating rice?
- I cut out carbs.

973
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,050
You were still here.

974
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,160
Yes.

975
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,000
Witness questioning?

976
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,500
Yes. You, too?

977
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,330
Yes.

978
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,080
Well, did the CCTV case get resolved?

979
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,690
After checking the footage, it turned out my client did take it.

980
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,070
He decided to confess honestly and ask for forgiveness.

981
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:10,200
It turned out it was just a mistake, and he wasn't a bad person.

982
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,980
Good job. I'm glad it worked out.

983
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,370
Yeah, I'm really glad.

984
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:22,490
Have dinner with me, too.

985
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,980
- Excuse me?
- I mean,

986
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,570
didn't you say you'd buy me dinner?

987
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:32,010
Oh, for Mr. Gu Dong Gyun's case?

988
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,680
Of course, I'll treat you.

989
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,550
Were you upset that I didn't?

990
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:40,300
I mean, I wasn't upset...

991
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,630
But a promise is a promise.

992
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,050
All right. I'll buy you dinner.

993
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,740
Think about what you'd like to eat.

994
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,440
Okay.

995
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,860
Yes, Mayor Park.

996
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,490
Attorney Ha Sang Ki?

997
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,420
What the...

998
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,030
"Law school, a modern-day aristocracy.

999
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,780
List of elite..."

1000
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,900
- Via the Institute for Equal Opportunity,
- Oh my, what is this?

1001
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,950
SpoNews obtained part of the law school admissions list.

1002
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:42,430
Many children of former and current judges, prosecutors,

1003
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,910
politicians, entrepreneurs, and civil servants

1004
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:49,050
were found to have been admitted to law school.

1005
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:52,010
In pursuit of transparency, SpoNews has decided

1006
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:55,060
to release the list of admitted students.

1007
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,940
Whoa.

1008
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,940
Hanguk Group Chairman Ha Jong Man's eldest son, Ha X Gi,

1009
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,830
was expected to join the family conglomerate,

1010
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,340
but surprised many by starting his career

1011
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,330
at a small law firm in Seocho-dong.

1012
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,650
This contrasts with Oriental Dew Chairman Lee Ja Yeon's second daughter,

1013
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,080
and Borinics Chairman Oh Gi Cheol's eldest son,

1014
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,910
who entered a major law firm instead of entering their family business.

1015
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,710
It must be rough for the prince of Hanguk Group to toil as an associate attorney.

1016
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,550
Did he get that law firm position through nepotism?

1017
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,980
I was one of your previous clients.

1018
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,720
Why did you pretend to understand me?

1019
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,190
Now that I think about it, it's so repulsive.

1020
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,800
Rich kids pretending to care... it's hilarious, really.

1021
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,000
I guess you want a moving redemption arc.

1022
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,280
Enjoying your "ordinary people" experience?

1023
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,030
"Attorney's Table"?

1024
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,480
Bloody hilarious.

1029
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,240
You're Attorney Ha Sang Ki, right?

1030
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,510
Did you know Attorney Ha was from a conglomerate family?

1031
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,890
So, no one is going to say anything about Sang Ki?

1032
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,470
Why are you getting all upset about?

1033
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,190
Yeah, let's give Senior Sang Ki some time.

1034
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,640
You're oddly kind lately.

1035
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,040
I guess you've gone clubbing quite a bit.

1036
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,290
Yes. You haven't?

1037
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,420
I thought we were closer than just work colleagues.

1038
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,010
I guess only I thought we were friends.

1039
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:28,520
Can I say something about that?

1040
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,600
Did I say this 10 years ago, too?

1041
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,840
You really don't remember anything.
