1
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,200
Hi.

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,080
Oh? What brings you here?

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,990
You didn't even call.

4
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,440
Why do you look so startled?

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,320
Were you watching something naughty together?

6
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,990
You should've called before coming.

7
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,880
Did you eat dinner?

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
Probably not.

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,950
- Go and wash your hands.
- Okay.

10
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,510
- Want some snacks?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,420
Snacks? You'll lose your appetite.

12
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,650
Eat dinner first.

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,680
Did I tell you I became a chairman?

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,950
What? Chairman of what?

15
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,800
Some business friends and I started a volunteer organization.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,900
- The chairman of that.
- Whoa...

17
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,000
There he goes bragging about useless things.

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,630
You asked to meet,

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,470
but you're not saying anything. Just like old times.

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,960
Was I like this before, too?

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah, when we broke up.

22
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,540
Why did you want to see me?

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,010
The trial's over.

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,840
Just because...

25
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,950
It's been a while since I saw you, An Ju Hyeong,

26
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,600
but I don't think I actually got to talk to you.

27
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,830
Have you been well?

28
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,550
Yeah.

29
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,090
I've been doing well, as you can tell.

30
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,290
I haven't been well, as you know.

31
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm sorry... about the trial.

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,420
That was the best I could do.

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,300
I thought it'd be good to end it quickly.

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,680
I know.

35
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,360
Ending it fast was the right thing to do.

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,590
For my sake as well.

37
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,840
After how I had hurt you...

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,300
I totally deserve this, don't I?

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
No.

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,180
I didn't think that.

41
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,790
I did think it would've been better if we hadn't met

42
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,250
under such circumstances.

43
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,460
If we had met under different circumstances,

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,530
you wouldn't have even talked to me.

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,690
Park Su Jeong,

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,110
be well.

47
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,590
That's what I came to say.

48
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,970
I used to really like this side of you.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,100
Yeah.

50
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,110
I came to say goodbye, too.

51
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,530
Yeah.

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Let's not see each other again.

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,170
Especially like this.

54
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,620
If something really great happens to you down the line,

55
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,140
just send me a text or something.

56
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,930
I'll be fine.

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,690
Thanks.

58
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,290
Excuse me.

59
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,180
An Ju Hyeong left already.

60
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,230
You should leave now.

61
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,810
Could you come out for a second?

62
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,260
Well, I asked to see you because—

63
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,630
Let me speak first.

64
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,530
I turned Park Su Jeong away.

65
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,300
When I went down after what happened yesterday,

66
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,140
she was waiting downstairs.

67
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,790
And I ended up telling her you had already left.

68
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,110
I crossed the line.

69
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,630
I'm sorry. I should've told you right away yesterday.

70
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,710
W-Why... did you do that?

71
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,520
Yeah, why did I do that...

72
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,100
I guess I didn't want you to get hurt.

73
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,800
I didn't think it'd be good for you to see her in that state.

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,930
That's why I did it.

75
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,010
You could get hurt needlessly

76
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,890
for something that's already in the past...

77
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,370
I mean, maybe not for you, I suppose.

78
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,470
So... what I'm trying to say is...

79
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,850
It is in the past.

80
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,290
You were right.

81
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,470
Taking that case was stupid.

82
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,000
I didn't feel at ease with it.

83
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,900
But I'm really okay now.

84
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,940
I wanted to tell you that.

85
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,500
So... you don't have to feel sorry.

86
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,940
I noticed you didn't have any emergency snacks last time,

87
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,360
so I just bought some for you while buying...

88
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,930
buying mine...

89
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,490
Thank you.

90
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,820
Please insert your card.

91
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,270
Choose your transaction.

92
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,580
Reading your card.

93
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,020
Enter the recipient's account number

94
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,820
and press confirm.

95
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,290
Enter the amount

96
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,220
and press confirm.

97
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,570
Transaction complete.

98
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,900
- What the...
- You scared me!

99
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,440
How come you have so much money? You don't spend your salary?

100
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Gosh, why did you sneak a peek at my account?

101
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,820
I'll sue you, I swear.

102
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,330
Sue me? Are we strangers?

103
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,770
- Security!
- Security!

104
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,920
- We have a problem here.
- There's no problem.

105
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,890
- We have a problem here, security!
- No problem at all.

106
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,640
This is good.

107
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,230
Let's have lunch here again in two Tuesdays from now.

108
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,250
Dip it in the salted shrimp. That's the best.

109
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,340
I'll eat it how I want, okay?

110
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,520
And who dips chili peppers in salted shrimp?

111
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh, right.

112
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,140
He's filthy rich. No joke.

113
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,940
It's fake news. Fake news.

114
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,530
It's not fake news.

115
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,240
Why do you still live there when you're so rich?

116
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,380
You should move now.

117
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,270
Did Old Man secretly save up that much money?

118
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,430
How is that secretly?

119
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,220
And I'm not that rich.

120
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,050
But why is Senior Sang Ki called Old Man?

121
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,350
- He acts like one, don't you think?
- Come on!

122
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,590
Not at all. He's an absolute fox.

123
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,090
What was your original nickname?

124
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,060
You probably had one in school.

125
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,300
I was "Spirit of Spring."

126
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,350
Was that supposed to be funny?

127
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,340
It wasn't funny, nor was it touching

128
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,150
or thought provoking.

129
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,870
Hey, you pay for all this.

130
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,210
You're not funny, but you're rich.

131
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,800
- You're crossing the line.
- Hey, aren't you richer, though?

132
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,700
That's my dad's money, not mine.

133
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,390
Your dad is rich?

134
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,820
My dad may be the CEO of a small, high-potential SME,

135
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,360
but he's not that rich.

136
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,350
He made some money as Hanguk Group's subcontractor.

137
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,440
If not for that, he would've gone under already.

138
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,850
How many times do I have to tell you?

139
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,310
I've never heard that before.

140
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,270
In any case, it's all your money in the end, Mr. Only Child.

141
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,810
I'm sick of that "only child" stuff.

142
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,810
Do you want to go up against the 6 million "only child" out there?

143
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,520
And you guys are all doing pretty well.

144
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,660
Who says?

145
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,330
You guys all graduated from law school.

146
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,760
Gosh, that's a dangerous comment.

147
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,300
Not everyone's well-off like you.

148
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,580
Others mistake us as such, but you know that's not the case for us.

149
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,880
Why are you getting so serious, Mr. Big Savings Account?

150
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,840
Geez, why did you have to bring up money?

151
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
You did, Attorney Jo.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,280
Yeah, I was talking to myself.

153
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,590
This damn mouth of mine.

154
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,580
My mouth is the problem.

155
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,550
Your symptoms haven't improved.

156
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,640
I couldn't take the meds you prescribed because I got pregnant.

157
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,070
Really? Congratulations.

158
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,020
Your husband must've been thrilled.

159
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm not sure yet…

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,860
I don't know if it's something to celebrate.

161
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,280
Then, I'll prescribe something safe for pregnancy.

162
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,210
Retail investors are idiots.

163
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,860
As soon as the price goes up a little,

164
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
they swarm in like rabid dogs.

165
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,500
Are you talking about me?

166
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,020
- You were a retail investor?
- Yes, of course!

167
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,820
Oh, shit.

168
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,170
That's hilarious.

169
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,930
Sorry about that.

170
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,950
- Anyway...
- Yeah?

171
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,460
As soon as trading resumes, we dump all our shares.

172
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,470
But these retail investors just gobble them up.

173
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,280
So, we make capital gains,

174
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,570
while that stock plummets into penny-stock territory.

175
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,960
Then, we do another capital reduction, rake in capital gains,

176
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,430
and repeat this cycle until the company gets delisted.

177
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,730
So, that's how I lost my money.

178
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,000
It seems like all my money went to you.

179
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,500
Do you want to partner up when I get out?

180
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,040
I'll make you rich.

181
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,250
I appreciate the thought, but I'll pass.

182
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,750
If I'm meant to make money, it'll come my way.

183
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,540
Otherwise, I'll lose my license.

184
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,070
What will you do with your precious attorney license?

185
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,560
Dammit, you're just here as an errand boy to chat with me.

186
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,740
I get to run my mouth and get paid for it.

187
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,190
I'd say that's a win.

188
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,990
Don't you think?

189
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,500
- You're totally nuts, huh?
- Huh?

190
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,410
This is why I like you, Attorney.

191
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,500
Thank you.

192
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,030
Mr. Seong,

193
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,740
how long do I have to go on these visitations?

194
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,450
Do you know how much we're being paid for those visitations?

195
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,110
If you can bring in that much business, I'll tell you.

196
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,870
Or...

197
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,750
if you get your father's company to sign an advisory retainer,

198
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,070
I'll take you off the visitation case.

199
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,130
- Never mind.
- The trial won't take long, so just keep doing it.

200
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,160
You don't have to go every day. Maybe every other day.

201
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,880
Okay, I understand.

202
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,910
Isn't this easier for you anyway?

203
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,220
You just go and hang out.

204
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,770
If I were you, I'd say, "Thank you very much" and be on my way.

205
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,500
This isn't theft. It's technically misappropriation of lost property.

206
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,310
I honestly don't remember anything.

207
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,750
Did you drink a lot that night?

208
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,770
My job-hunting wasn't going well,

209
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,440
so I went out with some friends to blow off steam.

210
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,110
I guess I went overboard.

211
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,010
Do you remember going to the convenience store?

212
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,700
I don't remember that, either,

213
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,290
but when I get drunk, I usually go there to grab one last beer.

214
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,280
So, I probably went there, but...

215
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,880
the police say the CCTV footage shows

216
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,830
that I took the watch that was there.

217
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,630
But if you took it, it should be at your house.

218
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,300
But there's nothing.

219
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,750
That's what's driving me crazy.

220
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,500
If it were at home, I could at least apologize and say

221
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,790
I mistakenly took it while drunk.

222
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,100
But that's not the case.

223
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,000
Then, at the police interview, don't accept the charges.

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Just tell them honestly that you don't remember anything.

225
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,960
But what if they think I'm lying and punish me more harshly?

226
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,180
During the police investigation,

227
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,660
they may or may not show you the CCTV footage.

228
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,000
If you say you don't remember, they'll probably show you video evidence.

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,970
It's not too late to admit guilt, then.

230
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,360
I really didn't hit them.

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,870
In over 10 years of teaching,

232
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,930
I've never used corporal punishment.

233
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,940
Are these the students' names?

234
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,790
No, they filed the complaint under the parents' names.

235
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,080
Then, do you know which kids filed the complaint?

236
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,650
Yes, I know who they are.

237
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,070
They were using the gym after school without permission,

238
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,350
so I scolded them.

239
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,550
A few days later, I got a call from the police,

240
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,140
saying I was being sued for child abuse.

241
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,900
But are seventh graders even considered children?

242
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,950
Yes, anyone under 18 is considered a child.

243
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,290
So, you're saying you only gave them a warning

244
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,320
and didn't physically discipline them. Right?

245
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,710
Yes.

246
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,750
But it says you made them get into the push-up position

247
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,320
and hit their bottoms.

248
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,470
I never did that.

249
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,350
When the police called me,

250
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,070
I wondered if I'd been too harsh with my words.

251
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,550
But when I read the complaint,

252
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,360
I was shocked by their claims.

253
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,690
I only scold students verbally.

254
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,790
Gently.

255
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,250
I see. Could you tell me the students' names?

256
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,200
I feel like they'll be on here...

257
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,270
Geez, I told you to knock!

258
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,410
Do you have a Newstagram account?

259
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,310
Huh?

260
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,500
Why don't you create your own account and check?

261
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,380
Why are you making me do it?

262
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,720
It's a hassle. I don't know the system, either.

263
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,400
And who has the time to read all the terms and conditions?

264
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,870
- Why would you read that?
- That's how you sign up.

265
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,900
Who knows what might be included there?

266
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,360
You're nuts.

267
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,740
Hwang Min Gu.

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,800
He really didn't hit them, right?

269
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,480
So, what now?

270
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Ride the wave.

271
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,310
What?

272
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,530
You know, "Friend-of-a-friend" feature. Wave surfing.

273
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,060
Friend-of-a-friend...

274
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,930
It's not "Wave." It's "Follow."

275
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,430
But I don't think those kids would've followed him.

276
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,180
Try Kim Sang Jun.

277
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,830
Nothing.

278
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,900
Nothing.

279
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,950
There's nothing.

280
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,770
Nothing. Damn it.

281
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,350
Then...

282
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,200
Then,

283
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,540
we can try this.

284
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,760
First, let's look for a student from this school.

285
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,180
Teacher, let's go here for our next school picnic.

286
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,640
_yea.na14.

287
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,090
She's probably in seventh grade.

288
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,520
Gosh, how should we respond?

289
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,420
There doesn't seem to be...

290
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,610
any boys on here.

291
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,460
She seems popular.

292
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,090
There are boys on here.

293
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,120
Joo An?

294
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,920
These are boys' profiles.

295
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,950
Wait.

296
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,870
- sangjuuun_kim?
- Kim Sang Jun.

297
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,610
Is this him?

298
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,630
I found him.

299
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,070
If you mess with us, you're done for.

300
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,300
How dare you nag us?

301
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,660
Bye-bye, Mr. Min Gu.

302
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,670
That's what you get for mouthing off.

303
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,740
Goodness.

304
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,860
eeeeminhyuk and others liked this post.

305
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,710
Lee Min Hyuk, Im Gi Hun... It's them, right?

306
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,560
Lee Min Hyeok, Im Gi Hun, Jang Seong Bin...

307
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,520
It is them.

308
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,740
Damn it, you found them.

309
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,010
- Yeah.
- Geez...

310
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,640
Then, I have to actually visit.

311
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,170
Do you want to come with me?

312
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,950
I'm leaving. Damn it...

313
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,980
Fighting.

314
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
Pass! Pass! Hey, pass!

315
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,590
Kim Sang Jun,

316
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,750
Lee Min Hyeok,

317
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,020
Im Gi Hun,

318
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,620
let's see... Jang Seong Bin,

319
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,210
and Kang Jae Ho.

320
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,170
Now that I see your faces, it is you guys.

321
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,370
Who are you, mister?

322
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,030
You're not allowed in here.

323
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,870
The same goes for you guys.

324
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,280
Kim Sang Jun, are you the ringleader?

325
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,590
How do you know my name?

326
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,840
You guys falsely accused Mr. Hwang Min Gu, right?

327
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,600
That's not true. We filed charges because he really did hit us.

328
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,720
Give me a second.

329
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,000
If you mess with us, you're done for.

330
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,560
How dare you nag us?

331
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,790
Bye-bye, Mr. Min Gu.

332
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,890
That's what you get for mouthing off.

333
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,290
Guys,

334
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,270
if you're going to commit a crime, you can't be dumb.

335
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,690
If you're this sloppy now, what will you do later?

336
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,940
You can't prove that our claims are lies with just that.

337
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,370
Well, you see, I don't have to prove that.

338
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,740
I just have to demonstrate that there's

339
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,300
reasonable doubt that Mr. Hwang hit you.

340
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,610
Even harsh words are a form of verbal punishment.

341
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,190
Then, you should've filed charges on that.

342
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,700
Why did you say he made you get into the push-up position and hit your bottom?

343
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,400
The gym was made for students to use. So, they should allow it.

344
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,490
Forbidding us from using it is unfair.

345
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,000
Then, you should've submitted a formal complaint

346
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
through the appropriate agency.

347
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,440
You can't make a false accusation. That's a serious crime.

348
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,660
What's that?

349
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,820
We're juveniles.

350
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,230
Oh, juveniles...

351
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,310
Then, you should've filed the charges under your names.

352
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,780
Why did you file under your parents' names and make them criminals?

353
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,730
And juveniles still get tried in juvenile court.

354
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,340
Community service, probation,

355
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,900
placement in custodial care, or put in a juvenile center.

356
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,830
Though I'm not sure which sentence you'll receive yet.

357
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,360
How did you even find my account?

358
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,710
There's no way you found that out yourself.

359
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,230
Why do you think that?

360
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,810
You don't look like you'd even know what Newstagram is.

361
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,020
That's harsh.

362
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,000
Do you guys know "Friend-of-a-friend" surfing?

363
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,270
- What's that?
- Don't know.

364
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,020
It's winter. Why would we go surfing?

365
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,950
I know. This guy is weird.

366
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,760
I know.

367
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,600
Saying you don't remember won't cut it.

368
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,190
He's not just saying that. He really doesn't remember.

369
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,240
You can't answer for him, Attorney.

370
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,810
You know that.

371
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,100
I really don't remember, and there's nothing at my house, either.

372
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,420
Then, I'll show you the CCTV footage.

373
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,440
Watch it and tell me how much you recall.

374
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,520
Both of you, come here.

375
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,210
Here.

376
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,720
The victim leaves the convenience store.

377
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,110
You see the small shopping bag in his right hand?

378
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,020
Are you saying the watch was in there?

379
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,700
Yes.

380
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,360
But shortly after, Moon Dong Geun enters the store.

381
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,020
Then, the victim suddenly gets up and leaves,

382
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,590
forgetting the shopping bag.

383
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,030
Then, Moon Dong Geun comes out and sits there.

384
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,640
Okay. Then, Moon Dong Geun gets up and leaves, too.

385
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,730
Soon after, the victim comes back.

386
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,350
But by then, the shopping bag is gone.

387
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,100
And he immediately reports it to the police.

388
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,130
You were the only person there during that time, Moon Dong Geun.

389
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,920
I can only conclude that you took the bag in your backpack.

390
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,230
But the footage doesn't show the exact spot.

391
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,840
Attorney, you saw the shopping bag sitting there. Right?

392
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,310
Did anyone come by during that time besides Moon Dong Geun?

393
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,740
I mean, how can you refute this?

394
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,380
Yeah, Mom. I just finished my interview.

395
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,900
Well, I don't know.

396
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,710
Yeah, I ate.

397
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,060
Yeah.

398
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,930
Okay, hang up. Okay.

399
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,290
I told her I was going to a job interview.

400
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,080
That convenience store is nearby, right?

401
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,720
What are you looking for?

402
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,650
When CCTV cameras are installed, they must be reported.

403
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,620
The police probably only had footage from reported CCTV cameras.

404
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,050
If reporting is mandatory,

405
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,360
that means there could be CCTVs that weren't reported.

406
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,970
That teacher is ridiculous.

407
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,930
How could he hire an attorney as if he's in the right?

408
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,490
The same goes for you. You're an attorney.

409
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,770
How could you go visit the kids and do that?

410
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,210
I mean, if you met the kids, that should be enough.

411
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,590
Why are you making us come in as well?

412
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,090
Because you're the plaintiffs.

413
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,590
Neither the teacher nor the attorney acts like a proper adult.

414
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,840
So, what do you want to say to us?

415
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,180
We're all busy people.

416
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,350
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

417
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,550
I'm Attorney Bae Mun Jeong of Hyungmin Law Group.

418
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,400
- What's up?
- You look outnumbered.

419
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,700
So what will you do? Will you maintain the charges?

420
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,420
They said they were hit because they were.

421
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,590
Why would they say that if they weren't hit?

422
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,250
And what? False accusation?

423
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,960
Do you have evidence?

424
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,590
I don't think you'd be able to prove it.

425
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,970
You're Im Gi Hun's father, right?

426
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,010
Yes. How did you know that?

427
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,630
You're saying the same thing your son did.

428
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,590
You can't prove that our claims are lies with just that.

429
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,750
The kids have all admitted to it now,

430
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,860
but if the parents keep playing ignorant,

431
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,790
we'll have to consider ways to hold you all accountable.

432
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,870
The kids lied. Why are you holding us responsible? Huh?

433
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,810
None of us knew this was a false accusation!

434
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,460
- This was the kids' doing!
- We didn't know!

435
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,990
Seriously!

436
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,620
I asked my relative, who is a chief prosecutor,

437
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,860
and he said if I didn't know, I wouldn't be punished.

438
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,290
So, you're saying it's your kid's fault, not yours. Right?

439
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,810
Yes.

440
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,180
Have you heard of this saying?

441
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,010
"Law is the minimum standard of morality."

442
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,550
There's this in civil law.

443
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,890
It's called supervisory responsibility.

444
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,860
Parents of minors

445
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,260
have a legal responsibility as supervisors.

446
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,390
That's the minimum duty as a parent.

447
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,500
But you say that kids did it, and you didn't know?

448
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,240
If you won't take ethical responsibility as parents,

449
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,750
then you must bear legal responsibility as supervisors.

450
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,360
Oh my.

451
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,520
Then, what can we do to make this better?

452
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,420
Since you're attorneys, give us some advice.

453
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,660
We are attorneys for Mr. Hwang Min Gu.

454
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,350
We're not the plaintiffs' counsel.

455
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,910
First, you should drop the lawsuit.

456
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,850
After that, it's up to what Mr. Hwang decides.

457
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,810
What would you like to do?

458
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,510
Hey, why did you get so worked up today?

459
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,950
You scared me.

460
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,610
I couldn't stand the sight of them showing up in droves

461
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,580
without realizing they were in the wrong.

462
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,950
We have to live with our heads on straight

463
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,390
so we don't become parents like that.

464
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,740
So, what time and where should we meet later?

465
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,790
I'll send you a text.

466
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,110
- Should we call Kang Hui Ji, too?
- Sure. I'll tell her.

467
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,380
You tell Ji Seok.

468
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,380
You do it. He's your husband.

469
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,120
He's your friend, Attorney.

470
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,130
I'm Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

471
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,610
Geez, I still can't let you. No.

472
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,180
We'll just check that brief time slot.

473
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,080
You're an attorney. Don't you know the law?

474
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,770
We can't just show stuff like this without the police.

475
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,880
No, if the person in the footage requests it,

476
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,740
you have to show it.

477
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,740
Gosh, seriously.

478
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,490
I feel strange telling you this since we just met.

479
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,420
But I have a criminal record.

480
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,190
So, I'm trying my best to live within the legal boundaries.

481
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,670
So, talk to the police,

482
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,740
and if they say to show it to you, I will.

483
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,450
Otherwise, I can't. You got that?

484
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,870
Please leave.

485
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,320
Sir!

486
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,490
What should we do, Attorney?

487
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,060
Are you sure the watch isn't at your house?

488
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,450
Yes.

489
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,830
Then, let's check this with the police.

490
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,170
But what if...

491
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,450
we check the footage,

492
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,640
and it turns out I really did take it?

493
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,380
- It doesn't smell much.
- It does.

494
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,760
I washed it in the washing machine.

495
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,170
Anyway...

496
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,980
- Fine. Good job. Smells like it.
- Really?

497
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,690
Please get us another glass.

498
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,270
Hui Ji can't make it.

499
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,460
Seems she's busy with work.

500
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,240
Oh, really?

501
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

502
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,740
You never ask for favors.

503
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,660
Why did you call me out in the middle of the night?

504
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,680
That's why I'm buying dinner now.

505
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,200
You live close by anyway.

506
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,740
Exactly. I told you to visit since I live nearby,

507
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,630
but you never came once.

508
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,920
Drinking with you is no fun.

509
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,070
It's no fun at all.

510
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,740
Y-You're... funny...

511
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,500
Outrageous.

512
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,230
Why aren't you eating much today?

513
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,590
What? I just don't have much of an appetite.

514
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,490
Really? What in the world?

515
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,630
Hey, did you hear from Ju Hwan?

516
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,290
He said he's being sued, so I gave him your number.

517
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,940
Yeah, I said I'd handle it.

518
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,700
You did? That's not like you.

519
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,270
You don't handle cases for people you know.

520
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,550
Yeah. We're not close. I only know his name.

521
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,500
Do you tell people that you're close to me?

522
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,980
I don't tell people we're close, but don't cause any trouble.

523
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,400
I won't take your case.

524
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,760
My wife's an attorney. Why would I ask you? Right?

525
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,250
I'd be glad if he's even capable of causing trouble.

526
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,990
No fun.

527
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,890
Both of you are hurting me as a tag team.

528
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,250
Hey, haven't you been on any blind dates lately?

529
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm busy.

530
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,470
What do you mean you're busy?

531
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,110
You even went to the school to meet those kids!

532
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,540
I went for work, not for fun.

533
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,120
School? Why would he go to a school?

534
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,480
Well, there were these kids

535
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,170
who falsely accused a teacher of corporal punishment.

536
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,880
Whoa, scary. So scary.

537
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
It's too scary to raise kids these days.

538
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,170
So, did it get resolved?

539
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,980
Yeah, I think so.

540
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,920
It's a relief.

541
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,640
What are you relieved about?

542
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,810
Well, it means my client wasn't a bad person.

543
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,400
Why is that important to you?

544
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,160
I'd prefer my client to be a good person.

545
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,590
Who are you?

546
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,890
Who are you? Are you ill?

547
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,460
- He's weird.
- He's always been weird.

548
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,690
He's weirder today.

549
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,540
I think you're right.

550
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,180
I'm so full.

551
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,420
Thanks for dinner.

552
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,520
- Thanks for dinner.
- See you.

553
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,500
It's such a relief that my client isn't a bad person.

554
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,810
I'd prefer him to be a good person.

555
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,420
I'd prefer my client to be a good person.

556
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,200
Gosh, seriously.

557
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,770
Attorney.

558
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,290
Do you want me to tell you something interesting?

559
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,810
- What is it?
- Do you know why

560
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,870
my dad assigned you to me?

561
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,760
Well, to keep you company, I suppose.

562
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,310
I'm telling you, you're so funny.

563
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,530
You're so naive.

564
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,680
He assigned you to keep an eye on me.

565
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,350
In case I'd rat that old man out.

566
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,440
- Pardon?
- Where do you think I got the money?

567
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,890
It's all that old man's.

568
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,200
But he's such a scaredy-cat.

569
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,400
Why would I rat out my dad? I'll be out soon anyway.

570
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,130
I've looked at the case records.

571
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,590
It doesn't look like you'll be out anytime soon.

572
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,100
Do you want to bet? Whether I get out soon or not?

573
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,960
I shouldn't be telling anyone about this.

574
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,010
It's a multi-million won tip.

575
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,370
You see, the stock-manipulation cases

576
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,620
are about to whom the unjust gain—

577
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,640
No, never mind.

578
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,730
When I get out, do you want to work for me?

579
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,670
I'll tell you then.

580
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,460
I mean, you're already getting paid to hang out with me.

581
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,510
You can stop pretending to be an attorney

582
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,610
and just play with me while working for me.

583
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,600
I think that would be fun.

584
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,980
Why on earth would I work for you, Jang Su Gil?

585
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,780
What's with that look?

586
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,990
Does glaring at me with prideful eyes make things better?

587
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,950
Why would I assert my pride in front of a lowlife like you?

588
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,330
You're not getting out. Not in 10 or 20 years. Got that, asshole?

589
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,220
You can't even get out of here. What the...

590
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,760
Who the hell are you to tell me to work for you?

591
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,970
If I'm a lowlife,

592
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,180
what does that make you, coming here to keep me entertained?

593
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,130
You'll be back here in a few days anyway.

594
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,550
Don't assert your pride.

595
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,900
It'll only eat you up inside.

596
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,260
Thank you, Attorney.

597
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,400
I'll do my best to teach the kids well.

598
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,080
- A girl you're flirting with?
- Geez, you scared me.

599
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,840
- Why smile while reading a text?
- You're wrong.

600
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,700
Let's go.

601
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,550
- Is it really a girl you're flirting with?
- No, no. Let's go.

602
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,800
Enjoy your meal.

603
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,960
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

604
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,030
What are you having?

605
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,520
We'll have Chinese spicy soup.

606
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,740
Chinese spicy soup sounds good.

607
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,320
What are we having?

608
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm not sure.

609
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,140
Hey, are you heading out to eat?

610
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,380
Of course.

611
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,980
Aren't we eating together?

612
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,940
I think I'll have to eat separately today.

613
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,470
You didn't say that in the group chat.

614
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,260
Why argue about it? She must have something to do.

615
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,450
- I mean...
- An Ju Hyeong.

616
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,240
I have a life, too.

617
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,400
- I'll get going.
- Okay, see you later.

618
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,300
- Make sure to eat.
- Okay!

619
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
What is it?

620
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,250
As I thought...

621
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,420
What?

622
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,660
Naengmyeon* sounds good.
(Cold noodles with vinegar*, also used to mean jealousy)

623
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,200
- Okay, naengmyeon.
- Today's a naengmyeon day.

624
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah, naengmyeon.

625
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,030
Enjoy your meal.

626
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,650
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

627
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,380
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

628
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,420
Yes, thank you. Come again.

629
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,510
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

630
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,620
Sir, the black bean noodles are really good.

631
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,360
Our black soybean paste sauce isn't just any black soybean paste.

632
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,550
But I still can't show you the CCTV footage.

633
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,700
I'll only check the part with my client. That'll be enough.

634
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,000
I've explained enough already. Bring the police with you.

635
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,960
Gosh, this is tasty.

636
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,170
Thank you.

637
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,340
- Hey, pull that in a bit.
- Gosh, seriously.

638
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,180
Nice. That's good.

639
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,350
But who eats cold noodles in the middle of winter?

640
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,160
It's originally a cold region dish.

641
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,550
I bet people there don't eat cold noodles in the winter.

642
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,680
You don't even drink iced Americanos when it's cold, but you'll eat this?

643
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,280
Mun Jeong strongly wanted to eat it.

644
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,240
She always strongly wants to eat.

645
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,830
Then, why didn't you order beef short rib soup?

646
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,530
Why do you always complain every time we eat?

647
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,700
How can I get beef short rib soup when everyone is having cold noodles?

648
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,680
That's true.

649
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,470
One order of cold noodles with broth for this table.

650
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,270
Yes, yes.

651
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,210
Hello?

652
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,450
Yeah, Hyung.

653
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,760
Yeah, I'm part of Hyungmin Law Group.

654
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,620
Kang Hui Ji?

655
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,450
Yeah, I know Hui Ji well. Why?

656
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,820
Hey, I called you to stop this attorney from coming here.

657
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,830
- But you come with her?
- What's wrong?

658
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,440
It's nice to see you again.

659
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,950
You two must be really close.

660
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,740
- I'm a regular here.
- He always brings girls here to impress them.

661
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,970
That's how he became a regular.

662
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,800
Hyung! Why would you say that? She'll misunderstand!

663
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,260
Huh? Why are you getting flustered? Trying to impress her?

664
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,670
What are you saying? This guy's weird.

665
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,640
But how do you impress girls here?

666
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,100
Well, you see...

667
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,850
- That's a trade secret.
- What a load of crap.

668
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,530
I can't let you see it.

669
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,590
But since you came with Chang Won, enjoy your meal.

670
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,890
I'll give you cream shrimp on the house.

671
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,790
Thank you. I'll come often.

672
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

673
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,060
- See you later.
- See you.

674
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,150
Goodness, sorry for the wait.

675
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,430
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

676
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,800
This is good.

677
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,500
They're really making me uncomfortable.

678
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,410
It's burned.

679
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,480
If you burn it like this, I can't post a picture.

680
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,550
- I mean—
- Leave that one out.

681
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,510
It got burned because I was waiting for you.

682
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,950
This one doesn't look tasty, either.

683
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,020
- Put a new one on for me. Just one.
- Okay, okay.

684
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,940
- A new one. Nice.
- It's frozen.

685
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,550
The lighting's good. Got it.

686
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,780
- You're good now?
- Okay, okay.

687
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,730
Oops, my bad.

688
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,730
- Is this revenge?
- I'm eating the burned ones for you.

689
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,510
All right.

690
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,890
Here's your fried rice.

691
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,850
All right, enjoy your meal.

692
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,120
Don't smile.

693
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,250
Come on.

694
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,860
I think it'd work with one more visit.

695
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,210
Right? With one more visit, we might throw up.

696
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,150
Gosh, this damn convenience store table.

697
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,280
Why did he have to leave it here?

698
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,750
Still, you're such a hard worker.

699
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,260
Sorry for dragging you into this.

700
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,700
Oh, no.

701
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,110
Following you makes me feel like I'm working hard,

702
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,120
so it's fun. I like it.

703
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,410
Really?

704
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,750
Then, does this seem like interesting work?

705
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,940
You said you wanted to do something exciting and worthwhile.

706
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,570
Well, it seems way better than my work.

707
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:53,530
I guess being an attorney doesn't suit me.

708
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,220
Why not? You're the most energetic guy at our firm.

709
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,030
I'm only enjoying myself because you guys are there.

710
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,090
The job itself... I'm not sure about it.

711
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,330
Still, if you don't want to be an attorney,

712
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,130
you could always inherit your dad's business.

713
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,390
Gosh, seriously.

714
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,820
That's my dad's company, not mine.

715
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

716
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,870
What about you? You said your dad also runs a business.

717
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,880
Yeah.

718
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,770
Just a moment.

719
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,670
Yeah, Dad.

720
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,220
No, I didn't forget. We talked about it last time.

721
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,850
Oh, next Friday?

722
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,440
Got it.

723
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Okay.

724
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,280
What is it? Something happening next Friday?

725
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,900
Yeah. My parents' memorial service.

726
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,230
What?

727
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,380
What? What's the matter?

728
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,730
I mean, just now on the phone,

729
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,260
didn't you call him "D-Dad"?

730
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,960
Yeah, I was talking to my dad.

731
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,010
Then, it's your mom's memorial?

732
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,090
No, for both of my parents.

733
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,650
What?

734
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,900
My parents passed away when I was seven.

735
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,330
My aunt and uncle raised me.

736
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,180
So, my uncle is now my dad.

737
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,000
I see.

738
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,100
Then...

739
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,640
your dad, who runs a business, is the uncle you were just talking to...

740
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,380
No, no, I mean, he's your dad.

741
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,980
Wait, no. You said your dad passed away,

742
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,410
so...

743
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,300
It's really difficult, right? You don't have to say anything.

744
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,960
No, I feel like...

745
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,810
I should still s-say something.

746
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,350
No, no, just be quiet.

747
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,580
- Can I?
- Yeah, just stay still.

748
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,630
I'm fine.

749
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,980
Thanks.

750
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,500
We've narrowed down to five scholarship recipients this year.

751
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,730
Four 12th graders and one exam retaker.

752
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,410
This student's family income fluctuates every year.

753
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,000
Let's do another background check to make sure

754
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,500
they didn't under-report before making a final decision.

755
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,790
Yes, understood.

756
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,930
Executive Director, Lee Dong Su, one of the first-year recipients...

757
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,700
Him again?

758
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,290
What about the victim?

759
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,790
They haven't hired an attorney yet, right?

760
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,110
Yes, it seems they are representing themselves.

761
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,330
Should we pay the victim for their legal fees again?

762
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,370
No.

763
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,750
This time, let's not just pay for their attorney fees.

764
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,080
Let's bring them here.

765
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,150
This is the Hyungmin Law Group, after all.

766
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,960
We'll have the attorneys here represent them.

767
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,920
I've always wanted to do that once I opened my own firm.

768
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,950
Okay, understood.

769
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,890
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Welcome—

770
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,920
Gosh, seriously.

771
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,400
I'm so sick and tired of this.

772
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,620
Are you sure it's okay to show it to you?

773
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,870
That's right! It's fine as long as you don't show me other people.

774
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,400
Have that guy come, too.

775
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,060
- He lives around here, right?
- Yes!

776
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,030
You better take responsibility if I get in trouble for this.

777
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:54,130
Come on, Hyung. We're attorneys.

778
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,070
- I have a criminal record.
- I'll defend you.

779
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,530
Deal.

780
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,530
Why'd you do that?

781
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,400
I can't even get a job,

782
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,450
and I stole someone's stuff after getting drunk.

783
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,130
Wow, I'm such a scumbag.

784
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,290
What do I do now, Attorney?

785
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,580
Act like you don't know anything.

786
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,220
That's how I should advise you as an attorney.

787
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,930
It won't be easy to prove you did it with only the police's CCTV footage.

788
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,720
But...

789
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,310
if I were your older sister,

790
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,630
I'd tell you to take that footage straight to the police station.

791
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,610
If you call yourself a scumbag for failing to get a job

792
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,290
and stealing someone else's stuff,

793
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,750
how will you live with yourself if you actually become a scumbag

794
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,960
by covering it up and lying?

795
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,640
It doesn't change your wrongdoing just because you're cleared of charges.

796
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,760
Estimation is about 68% of sales.

797
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,980
What the... Why are you all here like you planned it?

798
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,240
Oh?

799
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,580
Don't tell me you guys met without me.

800
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,120
We just happened to run into each other.

801
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,870
- You mean that, right?
- Is this kimbap?

802
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,980
I've been eating too much greasy food lately. I needed something spicy.

803
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,240
Eat up, man.

804
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,310
Spicy...

805
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,820
chili pepper kimbap.

806
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,230
Spicy chili pepper kimbap?

807
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,060
You got two rolls. Give me one.

808
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,920
Hands off! This is for Hui Ji.

809
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,690
I thought she might need it, too.

810
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,110
But Mun Jeong needs one, too.

811
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,880
What about Sang Ki?

812
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,850
Get one for yourself.

813
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,060
Since we're all here,

814
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,600
let's set a date to hang out since it's been a while.

815
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,350
How's next Friday?

816
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,000
- I'm available.
- Sounds good to me, too.

817
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,880
I'm free,

818
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,350
but Hui Ji probably won't be.

819
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,500
- Really?
- How do you know that?

820
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,760
I just do.

821
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,440
Because she needs to obtain the CCTV footage?

822
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,780
That's over now, but...

823
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,920
there's a reason for it.

824
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,960
Okay, then, how about tonight?

825
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,320
Tonight works for me, too.

826
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,900
- Me, too.
- That probably won't work, either.

827
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,040
- For you or for Hui Ji?
- For both of us.

828
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,800
Geez, when do we get together, then?

829
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,020
Hey, you said you've got a trial.

830
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,570
- Just go for now.
- Okay.

831
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,140
I'll just post a poll in the group chat.

832
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,100
This is Mun Jeong's case, but I'm doing a part-time job

833
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,690
for 10,000 won.

834
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,890
Hey, hey, hey! I said that's for Hui Ji!

835
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,190
What's wrong with that jerk?

836
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,950
Gosh, I can't do this. Seriously.

837
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,540
Bae Mun Jeong, take this back.

838
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,270
I can't do this for just 10,000 won, seriously.

839
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,400
Why not, Attorney?

840
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,390
How could you ask me to summarize 150 pages for just 10,000 won?

841
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,220
- No refunds.
- Give me 10,000 won more.

842
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
- Please buy me spicy chili pepper kimbap.
- Just 10,000 won more.

843
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,960
- Just 10,000 won more.
- Here.

844
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,530
- Yes, Managing Partner.
- You don't have court today, right?

845
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,830
- No.
- I heard my kid got hurt, so I rushed out.

846
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,440
I was so rushed that I forgot I had court today.

847
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,880
Could you fill in for me?

848
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,250
Sure, will do.

849
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,160
What time is the hearing?

850
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,020
At 4:00 p.m.

851
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,680
Oh, b-but it's 3:50 p.m. right now.

852
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,880
If you run fast, you could make it.

853
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,550
Let me hang up for now.

854
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,630
Sorry about that.

855
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,430
Shit.

856
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,560
- The files.
- Thank you.

857
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,960
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!

858
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,910
Excuse me!

859
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,820
Is the plaintiff, Pungcheon Trading, present?

860
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,360
Plaintiff? Pungcheon Trading?

861
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,520
- Yes, I'm here.
- Please come to the front.

862
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,010
Defendant Segi International?

863
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,030
Yes.

864
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,020
All right. The plaintiff submitted their brief yesterday.

865
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,890
We'll begin as soon as everyone is ready.

866
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,670
Hello, this is Ohn OB/GYN.

867
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,930
For appointments or inquiries...

868
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,380
Hello, this is Ohn OB/GYN.

869
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,430
Hello. Can I make an appointment?

870
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,030
The Chinese restaurant across the street?

871
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,270
Yes, there's a private CCTV there.

872
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,770
It captured everything with no blind spots.

873
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,430
Really?

874
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,530
Then, who was the culprit?

875
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,300
- It was me.
- Pardon?

876
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,330
Yes, it turned out my client had taken it.

877
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,050
I see.

878
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,290
Then, we'll discuss what to do about this.

879
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,480
We can take this as a surrender.

880
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,010
But I really don't know where the watch is.

881
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,250
I don't remember. I might've dropped it somewhere.

882
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,040
I'll compensate for it somehow.

883
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,150
Okay, I'll talk to the victim about that.

884
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Don't worry too much.

885
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,910
I heard it wasn't that expensive.

886
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,790
Oh, I see. Thank you.

887
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,670
I guess you didn't tell your mom that you had a job interview today.

888
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,210
No.

889
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,670
What did you tell her?

890
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,660
I told her I was going to the police station.

891
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,780
Good.

892
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,060
Thank you, Attorney.

893
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,000
From now on, just call me "noona".

894
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,320
Since you listened to my advice as a sister, not as an attorney.

895
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,690
Okay.

896
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,550
Let's go.

897
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,620
I'm treating you to thank you. I'll grill the meat.

898
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,360
I'm grilling so I can eat faster.

899
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,580
When I heard everyone went to a barbecue without us last time,

900
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,080
I got so hurt.

901
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,590
Because you were so upset about it, I'm buying you a barbecue today.

902
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,300
I felt like you missed out because of me.

903
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,980
Still, everything turned out well.

904
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,140
That guy is more courageous than he looks.

905
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,780
Yeah. You're right.

906
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,550
This one's done. Eat it.

907
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,820
Thank you.

908
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,740
Oh, wait, wait.

909
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,400
Ma'am, one bottle of soju, please.

910
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,900
I really don't want to go to work.

911
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,860
Why?

912
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,720
This guy I hate...

913
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,000
I told him off as if I'd never see him again.

914
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,300
But I have to go see him again soon. That could even be tomorrow.

915
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,130
You must hate it.

916
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,180
You understood what I just said?

917
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,150
Not exactly...

918
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:40,410
but seems like you don't want to talk more about it.

919
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,450
Actually...

920
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,350
I've been doing visitation work recently.

921
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,570
- Visitation work?
- Yeah.

922
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,410
I'm not even legally representing him

923
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,930
but I have to go in every day to chat with him. It's exhausting.

924
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,850
How could they make you do that?

925
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:11,330
No wonder you've been looking serious at times lately.

926
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,510
- How long do you have to do this?
- I don't know.

927
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,290
Not knowing that is the worst part.

928
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,420
Cheers.

929
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,640
Should we order another spicy cold noodles?

930
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,100
Yes. Ma'am, one more spicy cold noodles, please.

931
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,800
Okay.

932
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:07,890
Excuse me. We'd like to order, please.

933
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,580
- Over here, please.
- Okay.

934
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,120
All right...

935
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,330
As you get older, you need something hot like this in your stomach.

936
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,300
You shouldn't eat cold food like this.

937
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,540
I've been coming here for years.

938
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,800
Please enjoy.

939
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,210
- Okay.
- Yes. Thank you for the food.

940
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,440
Anyway, it's great that our firm has grown in size and our sales are up,

941
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,540
thanks to you.

942
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,230
Thank you so much!

943
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,550
- Don't mention it.
- Yes.

944
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,430
The meat is cooked really well. It's cooked well.

945
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,170
- Here, try this.
- Oh, thank you.

946
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,890
Thank you.

947
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,340
So, why did you ask to see us today?

948
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,050
I'm a bit busy.

949
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,320
Oh, yes.

950
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,530
Since you're all busy,

951
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,840
I should get right to it.

952
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,560
I'd like to ask you to take a case.

953
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,410
It's not my personal case.

954
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:13,650
I'm just introducing the case to you, so don't feel too pressured.

955
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,970
- A legal representation?
- Yes.

956
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:23,370
Out of all of you, I'd like two people to handle it.

957
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:27,210
Since Ms. Kim Ryu Jin said she's busy...

958
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:32,310
and Mr. Seong Yu Deok said business is going well already,

959
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:38,540
I'd like Mr. Na Kyeong Min and Ms. Kang Jeong Yun to handle this case.

960
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,200
Us?

961
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,800
I wasn't saying our business was going that great.

962
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,820
- So, you're talking two cases?
- No, just one case.

963
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,020
One case? Then, why do you need both of us?

964
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,260
I'd like the two of you to co-counsel this case.

965
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,180
That's the only condition I have for this case.

966
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,410
I'm all for collaboration.

967
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,830
I see, Mr. Seong. That's all right.

968
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,610
Now that we're all in one firm, let's use this opportunity to work together.

969
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,970
That way, I'll see the benefit of merging.

970
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,050
Together?

971
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,290
Think it over while you eat.

972
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,600
- How come you're not eating rice?
- I cut out carbs.

973
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,050
You were still here.

974
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,160
Yes.

975
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,000
Witness questioning?

976
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,500
Yes. You, too?

977
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,330
Yes.

978
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,080
Well, did the CCTV case get resolved?

979
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,690
After checking the footage, it turned out my client did take it.

980
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,070
He decided to confess honestly and ask for forgiveness.

981
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:10,200
It turned out it was just a mistake, and he wasn't a bad person.

982
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,980
Good job. I'm glad it worked out.

983
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,370
Yeah, I'm really glad.

984
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:22,490
Have dinner with me, too.

985
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,980
- Excuse me?
- I mean,

986
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,570
didn't you say you'd buy me dinner?

987
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:32,010
Oh, for Mr. Gu Dong Gyun's case?

988
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,680
Of course, I'll treat you.

989
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,550
Were you upset that I didn't?

990
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:40,300
I mean, I wasn't upset...

991
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,630
But a promise is a promise.

992
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,050
All right. I'll buy you dinner.

993
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,740
Think about what you'd like to eat.

994
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,440
Okay.

995
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,860
Yes, Mayor Park.

996
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,490
Attorney Ha Sang Ki?

997
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,420
What the...

998
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,030
"Law school, a modern-day aristocracy.

999
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,780
List of elite..."

1000
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,900
- Via the Institute for Equal Opportunity,
- Oh my, what is this?

1001
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,950
SpoNews obtained part of the law school admissions list.

1002
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:42,430
Many children of former and current judges, prosecutors,

1003
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,910
politicians, entrepreneurs, and civil servants

1004
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:49,050
were found to have been admitted to law school.

1005
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:52,010
In pursuit of transparency, SpoNews has decided

1006
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:55,060
to release the list of admitted students.

1007
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,940
Whoa.

1008
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,940
Hanguk Group Chairman Ha Jong Man's eldest son, Ha X Gi,

1009
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,830
was expected to join the family conglomerate,

1010
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,340
but surprised many by starting his career

1011
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,330
at a small law firm in Seocho-dong.

1012
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,650
This contrasts with Oriental Dew Chairman Lee Ja Yeon's second daughter,

1013
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,080
and Borinics Chairman Oh Gi Cheol's eldest son,

1014
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,910
who entered a major law firm instead of entering their family business.

1015
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,710
It must be rough for the prince of Hanguk Group to toil as an associate attorney.

1016
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,550
Did he get that law firm position through nepotism?

1017
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,980
I was one of your previous clients.

1018
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,720
Why did you pretend to understand me?

1019
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,190
Now that I think about it, it's so repulsive.

1020
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,800
Rich kids pretending to care... it's hilarious, really.

1021
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,000
I guess you want a moving redemption arc.

1022
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,280
Enjoying your "ordinary people" experience?

1023
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,030
"Attorney's Table"?

1024
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,480
Bloody hilarious.

Did you know Attorney Ha was from a conglomerate family?

1031
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,890
So, no one is going to say anything about Sang Ki?

1032

Why are you getting all upset about?

1033

Yeah, let's give Senior Sang Ki some time.

1034
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,640
You're oddly kind lately.

1035
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,040
I guess you've gone clubbing quite a bit.

1036

Yes. You haven't?

1037
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,420
I thought we were closer than just work colleagues.

1038

I guess only I thought we were friends.

1039

Can I say something about that?

1040
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,600
Did I say this 10 years ago, too?

1041
