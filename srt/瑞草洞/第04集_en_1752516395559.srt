CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,209
Who's representing the plaintiff?

4
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,378
I'm Ahn Juhyeong

5
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,464
with Law Group Hyungmin,
attorney for plaintiff Cha Jeongho.

6
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,383
Who's representing the defendant?

7
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,052
Are you the party in question?

8
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,137
Yes.

9
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,805
I'm…

10
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,725
Park Sujeong.

11
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,978
Okay, please take a seat.

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,113
The plaintiff is filing only for divorce,

13
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,785
and the defendant is countersuing
for alimony and asset division.

14
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,913
You do agree to the divorce, correct?

15
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,582
Yes.

16
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626
Defendant,

17
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,465
there's no specific reason
or basis provided for the countersuit,

18
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,636
so the plaintiff has nothing
to respond to right now.

19
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,805
Please have that part prepared
by the next court date.

20
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,475
And the plaintiff
will respond accordingly.

21
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,268
Yes, Your Honor.

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,981
Defendant,

23
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,900
you can't be crying already.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,485
This is just the first trial.

25
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,988
Then, we'll continue this trial later.

26
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,449
The next court date
will be on the 19th of December…

28
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,501
Hey.

29
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,421
Do you know why this dish
is called <i>jjimdak</i> and not <i>dakjjim?</i>

30
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,339
Why?

31
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,216
I don't know. I was asking you.

32
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,343
I mean, it's different

33
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,095
- from <i>galbijjim </i>and <i>agujjim</i>.
- Idiot.

34
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,891
Hey, did you change your phone case?

35
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,186
Of course, you'd pick that one.

36
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,231
Where did you get it?
My grandfather would love one too.

37
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,357
You punk.

38
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,985
Hey, this thing's great.
It can hold everything.

39
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,653
Are you going to cut this forever?

40
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,156
I'm chopping it up,
so we can eat it with a spoon.

41
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,534
Yeah, chop it up into bits
so it's easier for Grandpa Sanggi to eat.

42
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,244
That's enough nonsense, you brat!

43
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,455
Attorney Ha?

44
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,707
Hello, Director!

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,293
I had some business nearby
and just grabbed a bite here.

46
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,045
- I see!
- Enjoy your meal.

47
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,755
Have a good day, Attorney Ha.

48
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,883
I'll be in touch. All right.

49
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,096
Gosh, what a warm smile.
How about doing that for me too?

50
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,389
I am doing it, you punk.

51
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,682
What more do you want?

52
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,100
It's all ready now.

53
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,186
Let's eat.

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,691
Okay.

55
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,573
- You saw me earlier, right?
- I didn't.

56
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,450
I didn't say where though.

57
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,495
I'm sure it was family court.
It's the only place I went to today.

58
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,040
Gosh, you're so confident.
You really didn't see me?

59
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,798
What's with you?

60
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,759
Sorry about that. Excuse us.

61
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,928
Damn it. Is it because it's winter again?

62
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,057
Your snot's hanging out. It's gross.

63
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,850
Hey, we're eating here. That's nasty.

64
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,394
- This cut-up stuff better be good.
- Try it.

65
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,814
- So delicious.
- You little…

66
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,359
Want some? The cucumbers too?

67
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,153
That was good.

68
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,074
- Which cafe should we go to?
- I'm going to visit the clinic.

69
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,867
- Okay, bye.
- All right, later.

70
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,829
- So which cafe?
- I'm busy too, so I'm off.

71
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,288
You too?

72
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,665
Hey, where should we go?

73
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,250
I was thinking of this spot.

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,545
Huiji. You're coming, right?

75
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,381
What? I'm busy too. Bye.

76
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,800
What?

77
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,303
It's just the two of us.

78
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,765
This wasn't expected.

79
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,433
Let's go to that spot.

00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,004
DIVORCE

82
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,048
PLAINTIFF CHA JEONGHO
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

83
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,285
Hello, Attorney Ahn.

84
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,912
Hello. We had the divorce trial
this morning.

85
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,205
How did it go?

86
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,041
<i>There wasn't much progress.</i>

87
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,003
<i>The judge told the defendant</i>
<i>to provide a specific reason or basis,</i>

88
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,547
<i>so they'll probably submit that</i>
<i>by the next trial.</i>

89
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,384
She didn't write anything down,

90
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,012
because there's no reason
to ask for alimony.

91
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,058
She didn't say anything weird, right?

92
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,934
No, nothing out of the ordinary.

93
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,480
<i>I guess we'll just wait then</i>
<i>and see what she submits.</i>

94
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,940
Good work.

95
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,777
Thank you. Goodbye.

96
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,731
You saw me earlier, right?

97
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,233
I didn't.

98
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,196
He's impossible to figure out.

99
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,127
Since when do you drink hot coffee?

100
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,671
I lowered my standards for you.

101
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,967
Sitting here like this

102
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,095
makes it seem like
we're the only ones with nothing to do.

103
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,347
They're just acting super busy.

104
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,350
We're on the same page for once.

105
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,353
I dumbed down
the conversation quality for you.

106
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,649
Thank you very much.

107
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,035
I recently saw my father
since he was in the area.

108
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,119
Right.

109
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,330
He started going on
about Hanguk Group again.

110
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,375
Seriously, I'm so sick of it.

111
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,545
Is he still pushing you
to be their in-house counsel?

112
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,925
Actually, he didn't bring it up this time.

113
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,010
That's good progress.

114
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,637
- Hey.
- What?

115
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,889
What does your father do?

116
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,807
- My father? Why?
- What do you mean "Why?"

117
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,560
You know about my father,
but I don't know about yours.

118
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,312
Then, you can continue to not know.

119
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,897
Come on. What does he do?

120
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,483
Hey!

121
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,069
What does your father do?

122
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,654
He's taking it easy. He's retired.

123
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,740
Really?

124
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,533
Tell him to get some rest.

125
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,923
- You always turn up at this time of year.
- I know, right?

126
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,176
They're typical seasonal allergies,
so I'll prescribe your usual meds.

127
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,137
- The meds last time were fine, right?
- Yes, they helped.

128
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,891
I'll prescribe the same ones then.

129
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,644
You're not pregnant or anything, right?

130
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,312
No, I'm not.

131
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,396
Here you go.

132
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,441
Okay, wait just a moment.

133
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,526
Okay.

134
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,759
SELF-SERVICE MOTEL

135
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,867
The marriage certificate

136
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,077
- should be under that.
- I see.

137
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,080
DEATH CERTIFICATE
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

138
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,669
It seems the victim passed
about nine months ago.

139
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,297
Was that on the same day as the accident?

140
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,465
Yes, they said she died instantly.

141
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,844
- And the perpetrator?
- Song?

142
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,928
Yes.

143
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,347
He died the next day.

144
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,270
How did you learn
that the perpetrator was drunk driving?

145
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,730
The police told me.

146
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,691
He was drunk enough to lose his license.

147
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
- I see.
- It's weird, isn't it?

148
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,487
The driver was wasted and crashed the car,

149
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,407
but while the passenger died instantly,

150
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,952
he stuck around one more day.

151
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,956
Yes. By the way…

152
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,877
Did the victim have alcohol
in her system as well?

153
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,587
Yes, it was at a similar level.

154
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,634
Now that hear it, it's pretty ridiculous.

155
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,718
What do you mean?

156
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,180
They were both drunk.
One drove and one was a passenger.

157
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,598
They were both in the wrong.

158
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,769
But since he drove, he's the perpetrator.

159
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,979
And she died as a passenger,

160
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,315
so she's the victim.

161
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,027
I mean, thanks to that,

162
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,948
I can file for damages against him.

163
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,702
Yes, I guess you could see it that way.

164
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,788
How do I file for damages?

165
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
Right.

166
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,334
If you decide to file for damages,

167
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,919
you can demand compensation

168
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,046
from Song Yeongcheol
for your wife's death.

169
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,589
But he's dead.

170
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,341
Yes, that's right.

171
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,010
So we would file the claim
against his family,

172
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,428
who are his legal heirs.

173
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,721
I see.

174
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,517
So it's the people left behind
suing each other.

175
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,478
Yes.

176
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,108
Also, as you mentioned,

177
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,027
your wife was responsible
for enabling the drunk driving,

178
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,488
so compensation will be reduced
because of that.

179
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,408
Don't say she's my wife.
Just call her the victim.

180
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,076
No.

181
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,537
I'm the victim here.

182
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,372
Sir?

183
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,708
Do you know where the crash happened?

184
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,378
Right outside a motel strip.

185
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,881
They were in such a hurry

186
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,885
that they didn't slow down
after getting there.

187
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,100
Right, so…

188
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,228
There are two claims
you can file for compensation.

189
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,316
One for the affair
and one for your wife's death.

190
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,360
Is there anything you know
about the perpetrators' family?

191
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,695
Like who his legal heir is?

192
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,282
He has a wife, a daughter, and a son.

193
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,617
That bastard had kids.

194
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:52,165
Then, we'll proceed by naming his wife
and children as defendants.

195
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,624
in the lawsuit.

196
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,420
I heard both his kids
aren't even 10 years old yet.

197
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,671
Should we leave them out?

198
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
Let's include them.

199
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,017
If you only file against his wife,

200
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,145
your claim is limited
three-sevenths of the full amount.

201
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,855
And as I mentioned before,

202
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,233
if we consider the reduction
from the victim's aiding of drunk driving,

203
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,360
you'll be looking at even less.

204
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,405
Without the kids, the amount is too low.

205
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,743
Okay, let's do that.

206
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,703
Please file it right away.

207
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,954
I will, sir.

208
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,524
PREGNANCY TEST

209
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,863
Why is everyone so down?

210
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,199
Why?

211
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,911
What should we do?
Want to get drunk after work?

212
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,913
- No.
- No.

213
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,541
Yeah, I didn't want to either.

214
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,545
I'm a little tired.
Who even drinks these days?

215
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,880
I told you to stay quiet.

216
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,047
When?

217
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,132
I just did.

218
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,592
What?

219
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,433
- Hello.
- Hello.

220
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,851
- We meet again.
- Yes.

221
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,145
Don't mind me.
Please relax and eat.

222
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,868
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

223
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,329
Wait. You two are close now?

224
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,039
We ran into each other a few times.

225
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,167
Look at you.
You're such a social butterfly.

226
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,961
I'm getting competitive.

227
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,214
Step it up, Changwon!
I need to work harder.

228
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,180
Did you call me, sir?

229
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,182
This is the lawyer I mentioned.

230
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,352
Of all the attorneys at our firm,
he's the perfect fit.

231
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,812
- You know, we occupy this whole building.
- Right.

232
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,731
Say hello to Chairman Jang Gwanggi.

233
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,400
Hello, I'm Cho Changwon.

234
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,319
Yes, nice to meet you.

235
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,488
You're pretty handsome.

236
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,531
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,618
He's got a real knack for conversation.

238
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,246
Your son won't be bored at all.

239
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,749
So…

240
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,377
I have a favor to ask.

241
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,839
I have a son

242
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,841
that I can't just ignore.

243
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,427
He keeps complaining

244
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,347
about how tough life is
in the detention center.

245
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,808
Just until his trial's done,

246
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,893
can you keep him company?

247
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,646
Yes, sir.

248
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,110
It's nothing big. It's just a quick visit
for an hour each day.

249
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,446
The chairman's son
has been wrongly accused,

250
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,031
so he's currently in custody.

251
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,827
But life in detention is tough. Poor kid.

252
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,374
So are you saying
we're taking on his case?

253
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,961
No.

254
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,215
That's being handled by another firm,
so don't worry about it.

255
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,303
Just go and talk about what's going on
in the world for an hour.

256
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,975
Okay.

257
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,605
WRITTEN STATEMENT

258
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,982
PLAINTIFF CHA JEONGHO
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

259
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,491
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

260
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,288
I'm coming in.

261
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Hey.

262
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,919
You said you'd trade your divorce case
for my sale proceeds case.

263
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,755
- What happened?
- Oh, that.

264
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,633
I talked with Mr. Na,
but I decided to just keep it.

265
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,218
What the hell?
You got my hopes up for nothing.

266
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,180
That sales proceeds case is so difficult.

267
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,641
If you're stuck, bring it over.
I'll help you.

268
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,602
Why did you want to switch at first?

269
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,396
- You said I'd find out once I started.
- It's nothing.

270
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,066
What? Fine.

271
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,027
I'll need your help later. See you.

272
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,964
You're a little late.

273
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,134
Yes, I was stuck in traffic.

274
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,352
Did she submit this?

275
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,188
Yes. It's a written statement
submitted by Park Sujeong.

276
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,234
She wrote down a lot.

277
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,112
What does it say?

278
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,866
It says you were physically
and verbally abusive during the marriage.

279
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,623
DEFENDANT WAS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED

280
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,208
DEFENDANT WAS VERBALLY ABUSED

281
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,507
This is it? Where's the evidence?

282
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,634
She didn't submit any evidence.

283
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,222
There's no actual evidence then?

284
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,396
Did you assault her?

285
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,527
Does it matter? There's no evidence.

286
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,196
If it's true, now is the time to speak up.

287
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,700
That way, I can respond properly.

288
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,369
It's not true.

289
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,916
Even according to her,
it was just one time, not multiple.

290
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,334
So not even once?

291
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,382
No.

292
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,051
Not by my standards.

293
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,892
- What about verbal abuse?
- I didn't do that either.

294
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,019
Not by my standards.

295
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,196
All right.

296
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:25,159
I'll submit a written statement
firmly denying everything on that premise.

297
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,246
What? You don't believe me?

298
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,124
Whether I believe you or not
isn't that important.

299
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,168
How is that not important?

300
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,507
How can I let someone represent me
if they don't believe me?

301
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,849
My job is to help you properly exercise
your right to defend yourself.

302
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,521
What I believe
doesn't change how I do my job.

303
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,147
So don't worry about that.

304
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,718
Since the plaintiff's wife
died instantly in the accident,

305
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,764
there's no basis for a claim
against the defendant's husband.

306
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,767
A deceased person
can't be granted any legal rights.

307
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,895
The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled

308
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,399
that even in cases of instant death,
the right to claim damages

309
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,485
is still recognized in that brief moment.

310
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,529
Kim Minkyung knew
Mr. Song was drunk driving

311
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,447
but turned a blind eye to it,

312
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,199
so that fault reduces the payout.

313
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,994
That said,
the plaintiff's claim for damages

314
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,913
has nothing to do with drunk driving.

315
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,418
The claim also includes
compensation for the affair,

316
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,045
so that needs to be assessed separately.

317
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,341
Okay, all of that
is already in the written submission,

318
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,551
so let's leave it there.

319
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,680
The defendants haven't renounced
their inheritance, correct?

320
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:14,768
No, Your Honor. The house and other assets
are under Mr. Song's name,

321
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:19,106
so the defendants couldn't renounce it
based on their living conditions.

322
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,319
In this case, neither the plaintiff
nor the defendants

323
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,821
are the real parties here.

324
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,783
If anything,
they're all just victims of the affair.

325
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,456
Let's do this.

326
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,459
We'll schedule a preparatory hearing,

327
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,462
and I'll try to mediate directly then,

328
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,465
so make sure both the plaintiff
and the defendants attend.

329
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,802
But we'll exclude the defendants
who are minors.

330
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,347
Just have Lee Sujin attend.

331
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,850
Yes, Your Honor.
I'll talk to the plaintiff.

332
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:02,066
We've actually discussed this before,
but I'm not sure if she will come.

333
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,317
Well then,

334
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,694
please do your best to persuade her.

335
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,196
Yes, Your Honor.

336
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,073
The same goes for plaintiff's counsel.

337
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,366
Yes, Your Honor. I will.

338
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,329
Let's go home.

339
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,089
And I got everything.

340
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:30,386
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

341
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,683
PRESIDENT KIM

342
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,727
Hello?

343
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,148
Me? I'm clocking out.

344
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,275
Yeah.

345
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,798
Dad, what brings you here?

346
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,634
I just happened
to be passing by your office.

347
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,345
And you weren't circling the block
for the tenth time?

348
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,223
Hey, your dad's not that sweet, okay?

349
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,435
Put your seat belt on.

350
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,453
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

351
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,508
Aren't you exhausted
from working late every day?

352
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,720
You've been so busy
since you became a lawyer.

353
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,680
No, I'm okay.

354
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,390
I enjoy the work.

355
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,060
I have to put in the hours now
to learn fast.

356
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,938
Hey, it's not like
we live far away or anything.

357
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,191
We're a stone's throw away,
so visit more often.

358
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,234
Your mom misses you.

359
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,238
If she misses me, she should just call.

360
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,699
You know your mom's the shy type.

361
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,826
Since when?

362
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,371
She figures you're busy. That's why.

363
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,749
I know.

364
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,213
I liked it more
when you played piano.

365
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,382
You came home more often
and didn't work this late.

366
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,969
Don't most parents prefer
their kids to be lawyers?

367
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,432
If this is what you want,
that's all that matters to us.

368
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,142
Then, we're good.

369
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,316
But are you sure
this is what you wanted to do?

370
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:55,781
I've wondered if you suddenly
went into law because of me.

371
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,242
It's been weighing on me.

372
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,454
You're so full of yourself.

373
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,666
I'm not that sweet, you know.

374
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,626
Then, we're good.

375
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,712
Are you coming for memorial rites?

376
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,300
It's already been 25 years
since your parents passed.

377
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,930
Yeah, I'll be there.

378
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,743
- Thanks.
- Sure.

379
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,790
Go on and get some rest.

380
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,542
Okay. Drive safe, Dad.

381
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,524
Anyone here
for the 10:00 a.m. case?

382
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,320
Cha Jeongho and Park Sujeong?
Okay, please come in.

383
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:27,474
CASE NUMBER 2024-154671
CHA, PARK

384
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,693
Defendant, your claims are well-organized,

385
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,654
but you haven't submitted any evidence.

386
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,908
Do you have anything
to support the allegations of abuse?

387
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,080
Maybe photos of injuries

388
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,332
or an audio recording of the verbal abuse?

389
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,376
- Please submit them if you have any.
- Do I…

390
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,504
have to submit those?

391
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,844
If you don't submit anything,
there won't be any evidence.

392
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,430
We can't accept your claims then.

393
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,642
Defendant, do you have
any evidence to submit?

394
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,693
No, I don't.

395
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,571
The plaintiff has submitted

396
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,366
a written statement
strongly denying the abuse claims.

397
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,160
You've received that, correct?

398
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,205
- Yes.
- But you're saying you have no evidence.

399
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:33,999
Is that correct?

400
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,920
Yes.

401
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,383
Your Honor.

402
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,678
As we've already stated
in our previous brief,

403
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,680
there was no physical or verbal abuse.

404
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,475
The defendant has nothing more,

405
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,436
so we ask you end proceedings
and move to judgment.

406
00:30:56,063 --> 00:31:00,233
We can't end proceedings
at this stage just yet.

407
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,779
It seems the evidence review
for damages is almost done.

408
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,449
Let's try another round of mediation.

409
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,829
If it doesn't work this time,
we'll resume proceedings…

410
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,753
MENSTRUAL CYCLE

411
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,343
Hey, Munjeong.

412
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,303
Hey.

413
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,515
- Where are the others?
- Their trials have them a ways off.

414
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,226
Even Juhyeong?

415
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,186
I saw him at family court this morning.

416
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,312
You saw him earlier?

417
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,939
Yeah, just from behind.

418
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,484
Really?
He said he won't be able to grab lunch.

419
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:50,033
I guess Juhyeong
takes on his friends' cases too.

420
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,078
When I saw him, it seemed like
he knew his client pretty well.

421
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,663
I doubt it.

422
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,333
That's actually
the one type of case he won't do.

423
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,503
Really?

424
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,593
Why do you look so down?

425
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,053
Should we get dessert after?

426
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,098
Why? I'm fine.

427
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,350
Do I look tired?

428
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,477
Dessert sounds good though.

429
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,814
- What do you want to eat?
- Pasta and…

430
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,191
FIND MY CASE

431
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,320
PARK SUJEONG

432
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,868
DIVORCE
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

433
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,202
I was right.

434
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,621
TRIAL DATE
MEDIATION DATE

435
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,124
A mediation date has been set.

436
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,296
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

437
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,755
ATTORNEY IN CHARGE
AHN JUHYEONG

438
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,132
"Plaintiff's counsel"?

439
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,093
Not Park Sujeong's counsel?

440
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,127
- Hi.
- Hello.

441
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,383
You look miserable this morning.

442
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,721
I guess I knew
someone would pick a fight this early.

443
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,123
I saw you were handling
Park Sujeong's divorce case.

444
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,292
Are you okay?

445
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,005
What are you so surprised about?

446
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,258
We ran into each other that day

447
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,760
when you walked by
and pretended not to know me.

448
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,387
How did you know she was Sujeong?

449
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,101
Well, I just happened to by chance.

450
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,483
Why would you take that case?
Just because you were told to?

451
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,403
It's just work. Same as any other case.
I do what they give me.

452
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,738
How is that the same?

453
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,534
I thought you were representing her
for old times' sake.

454
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,661
What's so different about it?

455
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,873
Just because you act like an amateur
doesn't mean everyone else does.

456
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,376
What you're doing

457
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,336
isn't being professional.

458
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,796
It's being stupid.

459
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,382
Then, I should've whined and said,

460
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,467
"I can't take the case
because she's my ex"?

461
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,969
Yes, you should have.

462
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,723
But you don't even know to say that,
so it's stupid.

463
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,227
You can say those things all you want.

464
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,021
But I've never worked like that.

465
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:14,821
Do the others know?

466
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,366
No, I didn't tell anyone.

467
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,545
INVALIDITY OF DEFENDANT'S ABUSE CLAIMS

468
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,564
WRITTEN STATEMENT

469
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,369
It's so good.

470
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,871
Here.

471
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,791
- We should've went to eat pork cutlets.
- Why? This is good.

472
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,752
This is going to make your sweater smell.

473
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,961
Yeah, that is true.

474
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,430
Is it good?

475
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,155
- I have to go in here.
- Okay.

476
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,993
I'll be right back.

477
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,079
Okay, I'll be right here.

478
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,332
Don't come in. It'll be embarrassing.

479
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,918
Okay. You're going to be late. Go on in.

480
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:53,878
I'll be right back.

481
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,799
- I'll be quick.
- Okay, already.

482
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,893
Just have a seat.

483
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,545
How have you been?

484
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,215
Let's avoid any personal talk.

485
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,021
Did you have to stay on this case?

486
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,065
You should've hired a lawyer too.

487
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,109
Why keep showing up in person?

488
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,532
Let's just talk about the case.

489
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,994
Right now, I'm not Ahn Juhyeong.
I'm just Cha Jeongho's attorney.

490
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,376
You should drop the case.

491
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,005
Just hand it off
to another lawyer at your firm.

492
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,306
Why should I let you

493
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,643
find out that my marriage is a mess?

494
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,270
Why should I?

495
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,737
Sujeong,

496
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,698
do everything you can.

497
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,201
Submit all the evidence you have.

498
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,260
I don't have any.

499
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,355
Then, let's end this today.

500
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,985
If you drop all your claims,
we can wrap things up right now.

501
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,415
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

502
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,584
- Hello.
- How can I help you?

503
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,751
I'm here for a visit.

504
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,221
Okay, you've been confirmed.

505
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,764
Thank you.

506
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,651
Hello. I'm here for a visit.

507
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,155
One moment, please.

508
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,615
Okay. Here you go.

509
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,496
Sir,

510
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,124
you can head to Room 5.

511
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,681
ROOM 5

512
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,014
Hello, Mr. Jang Sugil.

513
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,266
I'm Attorney Cho Changwon.

514
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,145
Right. Damn it. I wanted them
to send a girl, not some guy.

515
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,274
You seem pretty disappointed.

516
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,821
But I'm considered
the prettiest one at our firm.

517
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,865
Yeah, I doubt that.

518
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,037
Well, you can come out
and see for yourself.

519
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,000
So what should we talk about?

520
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,002
Talk about what? Goddamn it.

521
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:48,089
I just wanted a female lawyer
to shoot the breeze with. Not a guy…

522
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,716
Seriously…

523
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,098
Fill me in on yesterday's
Champions League game then.

524
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,892
- Who won?
- The Champions League?

525
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,061
I don't watch soccer.

526
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,688
Unbelievable.

527
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,315
What kind of idiot did they send?

528
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,151
Then, how about this?

529
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,363
You were arrested for stock manipulation.
Let's talk about the case.

530
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,823
I'll talk about the case

531
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,784
with my lawyer
who's actually representing me.

532
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,120
You're not here to represent me.

533
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,206
You think you're here as a lawyer?

534
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,500
You're a loser keeping me company.

535
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,505
When does this end?

536
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,651
- Where are you coming back from?
- I had a trial. You too?

537
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,487
No, I…

538
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,239
had a prison visit.

539
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,824
I see.

540
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,752
What is it?

541
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,170
What?

542
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,340
It's just I've never seen you
with such a serious expression before.

543
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,008
Really?

544
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,346
Or are you not upset
and just out of energy?

545
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,431
What, is something wrong?

546
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,558
No.

547
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,353
I'm just bored
because nothing's going on at all.

548
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,940
Man, I wish I could take on
an exciting case for once.

549
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,650
Something that feels
worth doing.

550
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,986
What kind of case
was that prison visit for?

551
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,072
Oh, that.

552
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,782
Some stock manipulation.

553
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,618
There must be a lot of victims then.

554
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,163
The problem is,
no one knows if there's a lot or not.

555
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,125
You didn't get the records yet?

556
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,587
Yeah, I got them. Of course, I did.

557
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,507
But why do I feel so gloomy?

558
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,343
Everyone's been so down.
Maybe I caught it too.

559
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,889
Yeah, everyone's been looking down lately.

560
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,560
- Just in case…
- Yes?

561
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,272
If they ask something
that's difficult to answer, I'll help out.

562
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,690
So don't worry too much.

563
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,858
Okay, thank you.

564
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,777
All rise.

565
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,586
Please be seated.

566
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,844
I know this must be a difficult case
for you to attend in person today,

567
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,931
so I'd like to thank both parties
for making the time to be here.

568
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,892
Given the nature of this case,

569
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:50,146
both sides were, in a way,
victims of the affair.

570
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:54,734
So we felt it was best to help you
reach an agreement peacefully

571
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,403
without causing further harm.

572
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,363
That's why we called you here today.

573
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,868
We know this is painful,

574
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,289
and we hope you understand
the court deeply regrets

575
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,333
having you to appear in person as well.

576
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,421
Let's try to wrap this up
through mediation today.

577
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,256
Yes, I'll do that.

578
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,639
Did you really regret it?

579
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,645
Do you really understand how painful

580
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,521
this is for us?

581
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,153
We sincerely hope this can be resolved,

582
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:43,699
so both of you can move on
and start anew--

583
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,117
Move on?

584
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,206
Peacefully without causing further harm?

585
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,126
You think that's possible?

586
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,545
Do you think settling with him

587
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,006
will fix everything?

588
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,052
Geez.

589
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,596
If I had just

590
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,724
given up my inheritance,

591
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,853
I wouldn't have had to go through
the ordeal of paying damages

592
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,106
to my husband's mistress.

593
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,528
But I have two kids to feed.

594
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,742
And we need that house
under Song Yeongcheol's name to survive.

595
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,162
I was…

596
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,332
so pathetic
that I couldn't give up my inheritance.

597
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,587
You have no idea how it feels
to suffer this humiliation.

598
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,429
That's why instead of leaving it
to the court,

599
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,348
we brought both parties here
to settle it themselves.

600
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:50,850
So please try to stay calm.

601
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,393
Are you saying

602
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,896
if I handle things myself and settle,
I'll get a fresh start?

603
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,443
Do you think he feels at peace right now?

604
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,661
I mean,

605
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,582
if this were something I did,

606
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,462
I'd take full responsibility.

607
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:25,009
But I didn't do any of this!

608
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,644
There's no way

609
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,272
that I can personally

610
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,568
hand over the money
to my husband's mistress.

611
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,612
So please, just give a verdict.

612
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,031
Just take it from me by force.

613
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,202
I absolutely cannot bring myself
to personally pay them.

614
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,681
This is driving me crazy.

616
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,907
This will confirm
that the divorce finalized

617
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,992
and there are no remaining claims

618
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:35,329
for anything owed,
such as alimony or asset division.

620
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,529
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

621
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,949
So in this case,
there likely will be one more trial date.

622
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,827
If things wrap up then,
they'll set the date for the verdict.

623
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,163
Yes, I understand.

624
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,210
Excuse me. Thank you for your time.

625
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,800
Does someone like you

626
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,053
even understand how someone like me feels?

627
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,015
Let's go now.

628
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,477
People like you
are born into nice families

629
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,729
and go to expensive law schools,

630
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,523
where it's easier
to become a lawyer.

631
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,401
How could you even relate
to something like this?

632
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,945
You named my kids as defendants!

633
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,117
You shouldn't live your life like that.

634
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,994
Let's go.

635
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,999
I looked you up to see
what kind of person you were.

636
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,210
You're not the only one
who looked into things!

637
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,218
- Attorney Ha.
- Yes?

638
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,054
- Let's just go.
- Yes, let's go.

639
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,414
The case ended in your favor,
so you won't need to come in anymore.

640
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:48,212
How could I not show up
after hearing such good news?

641
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:57,388
It's nothing much.
Just a gift certificate.

642
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,265
I wanted to show my thanks.

643
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,685
- So please take it.
- No, it's okay.

644
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:04,979
Come on.

645
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,648
Take it!

646
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,319
You pulled off a clean win.

647
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,284
Yes, thank you.

648
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,377
I'm so glad I had you take the case.

649
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,840
I made

650
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,760
a specific request
when I talked to Mr. Na.

651
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,807
I asked for you
to be put on my case.

652
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,560
- Me?
- Yes.

653
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,687
You, Attorney Ahn Juhyeong.

654
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:02,745
I figured if she had to deal with her ex,
it would make her uncomfortable.

655
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,122
It looks like I was right.

656
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,754
You look very surprised.

657
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,589
I see.

658
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,302
- You came to me on purpose?
- Yes.

659
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,888
I came here on purpose to buy you.

660
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,267
We're getting divorced anyway.

661
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,354
What's the point of being polite?
It does no good for me.

662
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,855
How did you find out about me?

663
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,149
What?

664
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,568
Afraid Sujeong talked about you?

665
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,278
How did you find out?

666
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,326
Remember Jung Jihun?

667
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,453
Sujeong's friend?

668
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,122
He's always been a nuisance.

669
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,417
He's foolish and doesn't have
a filter when he talks.

670
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,839
He once got drunk in front of me
and started talking about you.

671
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,884
You don't know him?

672
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,636
Not really.

673
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,096
It doesn't ring a bell.

674
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,685
Really?

675
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,520
Then,

676
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,190

710
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,912
Excuse me.

711
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,542
Juhyeong already left. You should go.

712
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,151
I crossed the line.

713
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,822
Why did I do that?

714
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,581
INMATE NAME: JANG SUGIL

715
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,167
<i>You think you're here as a lawyer?</i>

716
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,918
<i>You're a loser keeping me company.</i>

717
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,721
<i>People like you</i>
<i>are born into nice families</i>

718
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,098
<i>and go to expensive law schools,</i>

719
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,642
<i>where it's easier</i>
<i>to become a lawyer.</i>

720
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,604
<i>How could you even relate</i>
<i>to something like this?</i>

721
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,118
<i>Are you okay?</i>

722
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:56,301
<i>Now, you're not Cha Jeongho's attorney</i>
<i>and just Ahn Juhyeong, right?</i>

723
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:25,622
Law and The City

724
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,197
Law and The City

725
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,408
<i>I crossed the line. I'm sorry.</i>

726
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,618
What do you need
that fancy law license for?

727
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,621
Who are you, Mister?

728
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,748
<i>We're too young</i>
<i>to be criminally responsible.</i>

729
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,042
That would make me
too scared to have kids.

730
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,462
He always brings girls here
to woo them.

731
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,797
<i>What do you do to woo them?</i>

732
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,674
<i>But it won't work for Huiji.</i>

733
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,718
<i>Juhyeong, I'm a busy person too.</i>

734
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,429
- Attorney Ha Sanggi?
<i>- I bet someone got him that job.</i>

735
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,889
<i>Having fun playing a commoner?</i>

736
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:25,974
<i>Actually…</i>

737
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,768
<i>Why don't you have a meal with me?</i>

738
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:30,812
<i>A promise is a promise.</i>

739
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,990
