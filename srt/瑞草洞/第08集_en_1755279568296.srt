2
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,040
Mom.

3
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,200
Mom, what's going on?

4
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,430
Your dad was about to go to work, and the police suddenly came and arrested him.

5
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,520
Why would they arrest Dad? On what charge?

6
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,860
Actually, your dad got sued and

7
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,280
was being investigated.

8
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,900
What?

9
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,070
Then, you should've told me!

10
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,450
The accusations were just too absurd.

11
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,290
I didn't want you to worry for no reason.

12
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,150
What was the charge?

13
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,940
Fraud.

14
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,890
Fraud?

15
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,820
It must be a misunderstanding. He'll be released soon.

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,590
There's no way he'd do something like that.

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,140
Fraud of all things?

18
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,220
There's no way.

19
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,650
- Where are you?
- I'll call you back.

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,290
Hello.

21
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,460
What brings you here?

22
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,010
I'm here to meet a detainee.

23
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,120
Is this an attorney visitation or a family visit?

24
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,110
A family visit.

25
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,490
Mr. Kim Myeong Ho is refusing to meet you.

26
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,440
Pardon? He refused?

27
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,590
Does he know who came?

28
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,070
Yes, he agreed to come out when I said it was family.

29
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,970
But he declined when I said it was his daughter.

30
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,060
What? It's not like that, right?

31
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,240
It isn't, right?

32
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,980
Yeah, I always had faith in you, President Shin.

33
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,790
So, please give me at least my money back. Okay?

34
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,900
What do you mean you don't have it?

35
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,100
You got what I sent through President Park!

36
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,070
No.

37
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,060
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.

38
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,260
Please, I'm begging you.

39
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,660
No... that's not it.

40
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,440
Hui Ji.

41
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,460
Don't worry.

42
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,010
I'll get that money back, no matter what.

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,320
I'll put it all back again.

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
No way...

45
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,070
Non-extendable period.

46
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,790
Attorneys must always be very careful with non-extendable periods.

47
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,200
Whether it's an appeal period or an objection period,

48
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,200
being late by even a minute is irreversible.

49
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,500
Understand?

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,570
- Yes.
- Yes.

51
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
W-Why are you looking at me?

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,460
You didn't submit your assignment.

53
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,740
I did! I emailed it to you.

54
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,320
The deadline was yesterday, but you submitted it past midnight at 12:05 a.m.

55
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,380
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

56
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,310
Advisor.

57
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,340
Oh, yes.

58
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,290
Can we talk for a second?

59
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,230
- Of course. You guys keep working.
- Okay.

60
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,150
Shall we go inside?

61
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,680
Would you like to take a seat?

62
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,050
No, no.

63
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,740
This isn't a sit-down conversation.

64
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,690
I'm just a bit uncomfortable with

65
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,930
how often you keep calling Attorney Ha away.

66
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,500
I would like you to stop calling him away.

67
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,560
Oh, that? Tomorrow is the last day.

68
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,230
It's true that I asked him for help at first,

69
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,110
but now, I think he enjoys it more.

70
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,040
He looks after them often.

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,810
Since it's good for the students,

72
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,450
and he seems to enjoy it,

73
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,610
please allow us to continue just a little longer. Please?

74
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,630
Is that what Attorney Ha said? That he enjoys this?

75
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,890
Do you want to go and watch?

76
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,310
No, no. Why would I do that?

77
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,510
Okay. I understand.

78
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,060
Okay, then. I'll head out first.

79
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,940
I was in the middle of listening, so...

80
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,800
Applause.

81
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,220
All of your assignments have failed.

82
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,400
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

83
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,640
Come on, you said the ruling would be in our favor.

84
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,170
In this case, what kind of property are we dealing with?

85
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,890
Farmland, right?

86
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,640
What does the Korean Constitution say about farmland?

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,830
Gyeongja Yujeon.

88
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,520
It means "Farmland may only be owned by farmers."

89
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,790
So, even if you won the trial,

90
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,550
you can't reclaim the land unless you're a farmer.

91
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,900
So, for this assignment,

92
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,460
you had to consider not only how to win

93
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,270
but also how to legally own the land.

94
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,650
If you think winning is everything,

95
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,370
you won't become a good attorney.

96
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,800
- Yes.
- Okay.

97
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,030
Let's be good friends.

98
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,750
I can't put it here.

99
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,030
Yes?

100
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,850
Attorney Jo, the decision for the voice phishing case came out.

101
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,080
The defendant was found guilty.

102
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,200
- Ms. Do Mi Gyeong's case?
- Yes.

103
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,370
She was fined 10 million won.

104
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,880
Okay, got it.

105
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,000
What the hell? This is unbelievable.

106
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,050
You are back, Attorney Kang.

107
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,710
Yes. I'm sorry for taking the morning off on short notice.

108
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,920
It's okay, no worries.

109
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,450
Is everything okay now?

110
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,890
Yes, thanks to you, it's all good now.

111
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm glad to hear that.

112
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,260
Attorney, are you expecting a complaint to come through?

113
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,550
A fax came in under your name.

114
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,480
Oh, yes. Thank you.

115
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,340
I don't know what crypto you're referring to.

116
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,350
I never received any money.

117
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,300
Weren't you dealing with Ms. Choi Seong Mi?

118
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,600
I'll get that money back, no matter what.

119
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,150
I'll put it all back again.

120
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,480
Oh, you're back again.

121
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,820
Family visitation hours are over.

122
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,140
This is an attorney visit.

123
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,800
Please tell him to come out. Please.

124
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,780
Oh, okay.

125
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,840
Why did you come all the way here?

126
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,390
It's not even a big deal.

127
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,180
It's the same scheme you fell for yourself, Dad.

128
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,070
How did you know that?

129
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,010
You're not thinking of representing me, are you?

130
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,700
Hui Ji...

131
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,700
absolutely not. Listen to me.

132
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,050
That's what I came out to tell you.

133
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,770
It wasn't this, right?

134
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,920
When you said you'd put things back, no matter what,

135
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,600
you didn't mean this. Right?

136
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,510
I really don't know anything about this.

137
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,650
There must be some misunderstanding.

138
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,240
It'll get resolved soon. Don't worry.

139
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,000
Dad.

140
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,820
Don't come anymore.

141
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,940
Okay? I'll see you when I get out.

142
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,620
All right, relay this to the client.

143
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,610
Okay, thank you.

144
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,780
Aren't you close with the attorney on the 8th floor?

145
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,850
Yes, we're pretty close.

146
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,190
It appears something's going on with her family.

147
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,860
Her dad was in a holding cell.

148
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,020
Pardon?

149
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,870
I happened to see him at the station.

150
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,300
Pardon? He refused?

151
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,710
Does he know who came?

152
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,470
He agreed to come out when I said it's family.

153
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,830
But he declined when I said it was his daughter.

154
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,540
Maybe he has a criminal record.

155
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,850
They didn't seem that close.

156
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,010
I don't really know that much.

157
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,010
I guess you're not that close to her. That's good.

158
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,350
Don't get too close to her.

159
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,160
You can go.

160
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,930
- I'll do it, Mom.
- We'll hire another attorney.

161
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,100
Don't get involved.

162
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,420
What's the big deal about it? I'm an attorney.

163
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,210
If you take this case, your managing partner will find out.

164
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,160
How will you explain taking this case?

165
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,080
That your dad was arrested for fraud,

166
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,020
so you need to represent him?

167
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,600
But Dad didn't commit fraud.

168
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,260
I'll tell my managing partner that. That's enough.

169
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,410
Still, no.

170
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,300
Don't talk about this anymore.

171
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,760
We don't want you

172
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
getting hurt at all because of us.

173
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,840
That's how we felt when we first took you in

174
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,080
and even more so now.

175
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,260
Mom...

176
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,380
- Hello?
- Where are you? I'm currently...

177
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,090
You were here.

178
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,300
Well...

179
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
could you do me a favor?

180
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,400
If your firm can take this case on paper,

181
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,640
I'll handle all the actual work.

182
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,640
I need you to handle physical appearances like visitations and trials.

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,140
And tell Mr. Na that it's just a distant acquaintance's case.

184
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,910
Are you okay?

185
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,400
Pardon?

186
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,940
You're going through a big ordeal.

187
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,670
It was tough at first,

188
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,360
but I'm okay now.

189
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm sorry to ask you this.

190
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,240
I'll do it.

191
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,580
Kim Myeong Ho...

192
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,520
That's why I invest with President Kim Myeong Ho.

193
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,190
Since he's in the trading business,

194
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,800
he knows a lot about foreign crypto.

195
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,500
- President Kim does that kind of business, too?
- Yes.

196
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,400
Please have a seat. I was telling them about your crypto investment business.

197
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,200
What exactly is it?

198
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,040
Oh, about that...

199
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,780
I'm planning to buy some promising foreign cryptocurrencies.

200
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,370
Since I know the market well, if you invest through me,

201
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,160
I'll set up a digital wallet for you

202
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,770
and distribute profits, too.

203
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,970
That's not all.

204
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,040
If you bring other investors in,

205
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,650
he'll increase your profits. It's multi-level marketing.

206
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,250
So, if you want to invest, you have to do it through me. Okay?

207
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,740
Then, you'll increase my payout. Right?

208
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,860
Don't get ahead of yourself.

209
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,090
They don't even seem interested in investing.

210
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,880
Well, what's the expected return?

211
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,970
I don't know what crypto you're referring to.

212
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,200
I never received any money.

213
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Weren't you dealing with Ms. Choi Seong Mi?

214
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,360
What are you talking about right now?

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,840
We clearly agreed to invest through Ms. Choi,

216
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,750
and she showed us the proof of the money transfer to you—

217
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,110
So, did I ever sign an investment contract with you?

218
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,350
We didn't, right?

219
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,060
What are you doing? Did you eat?

220
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,980
Oh, just something quick.

221
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,930
It feels like I haven't seen you in a while.

222
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,780
So...

223
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,360
do you have a moment?

224
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,040
Well...

225
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,680
is your dad okay?

226
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,230
What are you talking about?

227
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,790
I thought to keep pretending not to know,

228
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,960
but I was worried.

229
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,930
I heard your dad is being detained.

230
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,130
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,870
I happened to find out by accident.

232
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,100
My managing partner happened to see him at the police station.

233
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,520
Well...

234
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,720
he's been falsely accused.

235
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,700
- Falsely accused?
- Yeah, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

236
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,000
Which idiots detained him without investigating properly?

237
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,240
Was it the police or the prosecution?

238
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,070
Will you be able to handle this alone?

239
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,980
Ju Hyeong agreed to help me.

240
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,050
So, Ju Hyeong knows about it.

241
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,530
Yeah, it just happened to be.

242
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,800
Everyone was really worried

243
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,220
when they couldn't reach you yesterday, not just me.

244
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,510
Really? I had no idea.

245
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,340
I'll reach out to them.

246
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,910
Okay.

247
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,680
Got it.

248
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,750
Yes?

249
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,580
Attorney, Ms. Do Mi Gyeong is here.

250
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,290
Oh, okay.

251
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,140
Hello, Attorney.

252
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,520
- Hello. Please take a seat.
- Yes.

253
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
I was found guilty.

254
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,890
I got fined 10 million won.

255
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,280
Yes.

256
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,450
I heard as well.

257
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,970
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,790
No, don't be.

259
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,130
It was my fault.

260
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,940
I'm grateful for your help.

261
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,400
I've got nothing to offer you,

262
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,000
but I came back nevertheless

263
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,920
because I didn't understand what that said

264
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,080
about what happens if I can't pay the fine.

265
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,260
That's what I came to ask.

266
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm glad you came.

267
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,300
It says here that if you can't pay the fine,

268
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,200
you'll be imprisoned.

269
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,870
While you're there, you can work to pay off

270
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,150
100,000 won a day from your fine.

271
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,430
Then, I can pay it off with labor.

272
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,750
That's a relief.

273
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,200
When should I go in?

274
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,130
For this...

275
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,080
you don't voluntarily go in.

276
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,800
Don't worry about this fine. I'll pay it for you.

277
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,620
- Pardon?
- You don't have to worry. It's fine.

278
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,300
No, no.

279
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,230
What are you saying?

280
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,530
Gosh, I shouldn't have come.

281
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,500
I'm not giving it to you. I'm lending it to you.

282
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,100
- You can pay it back slowly.
- No, absolutely not.

283
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,170
- It's really okay. All right?
- Attorney.

284
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,110
Yes, I came asking for help.

285
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,450
But I didn't come for that kind of help.

286
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,570
I may not be book smart, but I know right from wrong.

287
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,620
Whether I have to steal or work it off,

288
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,670
I'll handle it myself.

289
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,460
Thank you for all your help so far.

290
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,130
Goodbye.

291
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,240
Ms. Kim, I'll head out first.

292
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Okay. Wait.

293
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,050
Come in for a second.

294
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
Yes?

295
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,750
There's a farewell party for the interns today, right?

296
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,030
Pay with this.

297
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,180
It's okay. The Advisor is already going to pay.

298
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,530
Just say you're treating and use this.

299
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,150
Thank you.

300
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,960
You seem to really enjoy teaching.

301
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,030
Your eyes were sparkling.

302
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,980
Pardon?

303
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,990
It was impressive.

304
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,720
Oh, yes.

305
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,470
Yes, well...

306
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,780
You can go.

307
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,260
Okay.

308
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,370
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

309
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,500
Should I close the door?

310
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,180
It's all right. Just leave it.

311
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,120
You're here.

312
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,780
Yes.

313
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,420
Did you have dinner?

314
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,410
Not yet.

315
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,220
Let's head out after sitting like this for a bit.

316
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,290
Did you read the complaint?

317
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,610
You said it's your father's case, right?

318
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,320
Yes.

319
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,770
If I take this case, even if just on paper,

320
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,190
I'll end up learning a lot more about you than you might like.

321
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,600
Will you still be comfortable with me even if that happens?

322
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,950
Of course. I'll be fine.

323
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,340
My parents passed away in an accident when I was little

324
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,700
so my aunt and uncle raised me as their own.

325
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,780
That's why my dad and I have different last names.

326
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
I don't care if you find out things like this.

327
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,100
If you're okay, I am, too.

328
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,730
I thought I'd prepared for...

329
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,200
something like this ever since I became an attorney.

330
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,030
But it's not as easy as I thought.

331
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,470
Don't try to carry it all alone.

332
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,200
Isn't that why you told me about it?

333
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,720
Hello. Nice to meet you for the first time.

334
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,280
My name is An Ju Hyeong.

335
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,790
Hello.

336
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,170
I heard you work with Hui Ji.

337
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,570
Yes.

338
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,830
Technically, we're not at the same firm. Feel free to speak to me openly.

339
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,120
T-That doesn't matter.

340
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,600
As long as Hui Ji doesn't handle this case.

341
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,370
Let's start by talking about the charity event.

342
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,070
Can you tell me what happened with Choi Seong Mi?

343
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,960
It was an unfamiliar setting, so I felt awkward there.

344
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,660
And President Choi wasn't next to me, either.

345
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,400
Hello.

346
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,730
President Kim has everything set up solidly,

347
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,030
so I have no worries.

348
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,540
Isn't that right, President?

349
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,290
Yes.

350
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,520
Thanks to President Choi, our business got some breathing room as well.

351
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,250
They are also interested in international trade.

352
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,120
If I introduce them, you have to take care of them. Okay?

353
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
Of course.

354
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,630
Then, you'll adjust my transaction fee rate as well. Right?

355
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,280
Yes, I'll do that.

356
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,400
But you have to deal with me first. Okay?

357
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,580
President Choi is good at what she does.

358
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,160
You can trust her and do deals with her.

359
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,680
I wonder if buttering her up at the time was misunderstood.

360
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,320
So, what exactly are they accusing me of?

361
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,570
The charge is investment fraud.

362
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,300
That you colluded with Choi Seong Mi

363
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,690
to promote a fake multi-level crypto investment scheme.

364
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,080
Choi Seong Mi says she doesn't know about it

365
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,260
and claims you were the one leading it.

366
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,460
President Choi, how could she...

367
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,910
When did you first meet Choi Seong Mi?

368
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,690
About two years ago?

369
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,630
I met her while doing business with her.

370
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,540
There's a record of 900 million won being transferred to you. What was that?

371
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,630
She once urgently asked for a loan.

372
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,750
So, I took her goods as collateral

373
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,150
and lent it under the company's name and got it repaid.

374
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,640
Did you write a loan agreement?

375
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,000
- Yes.
- Do you still have it?

376
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,320
Not anymore.

377
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,200
I returned it since she repaid the loan.

378
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,940
What about the transaction history when you gave her the loan?

379
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,620
I lent it to her in cash.

380
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,570
Nine hundred million won in cash?

381
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,020
Yes.

382
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,060
I see.

383
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,550
I'm sorry if I made you worry.

384
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,350
Don't apologize.

385
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,710
Just focus on yourself. Don't worry about us.

386
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,770
Yeah.

387
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,770
Hey, Jo Chang Won—

388
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,230
What's with your reaction? Did you know about this already?

389
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,350
Well...

390
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,020
Yeah, I did, but Hui Ji didn't tell me.

391
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,680
I found out by accident.

392
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,240
If you knew, you should've given us a heads-up.

393
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,080
How could I talk about something like that?

394
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,970
Why didn't you say anything?

395
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,650
How much have you told them?

396
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,560
I told them everything.

397
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,120
All right, okay.

398
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,420
Is there anything we can help with?

399
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,180
Why ask? Of course, we should help.

400
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,940
That's why I asked.

401
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,560
Yeah, we should help, too.

402
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,930
Great. Let's work together.

403
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,850
All right, group intelligence.

404
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,560
Fighting!

405
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,550
Kim Myeong Ho says he's only known me for two years?

406
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,830
Yes. And he said you were the only one he knew at that event.

407
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,660
Look here. The weather was awful that day.

408
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,210
But Kim Myeong Ho insisted I come

409
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,070
because people with money would be coming.

410
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,270
What do you think that means?

411
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,490
What does it mean?

412
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,810
It means, "Let's try to get some money."

413
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,950
Back in 2019, I think?

414
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,840
We had plans to launch a crypto business together.

415
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,430
He said he'd do it alone this time

416
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,500
and promised to pay me a commission if I bring in some investments.

417
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,580
If it were that kind of event, he could've done it alone.

418
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,900
Why would he have you come when he'd have to pay you commission?

419
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,190
You don't get investments by just talking alone.

420
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,760
You need someone to hype it up next to you.

421
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,720
If you have someone saying they also invested, even better.

422
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,010
I'm in here because I agreed to help him with that.

423
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,970
Gosh, I shouldn't have said I invested, too.

424
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,360
Even if all of that's true,

425
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,320
you were the one recommending the investment.

426
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,940
At the very least, doesn't it make you an accomplice to fraud?

427
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,130
I had no idea the whole crypto business was non-existent!

428
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,210
That's why I even asked the investors for a kickback.

429
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,040
To give me a share of the earnings they get from Kim Myeong Ho.

430
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,930
Only then will I connect them.

431
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,500
So, who do you think is telling the truth?

432
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,310
Kim Myeong Ho or me?

433
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm here to prove that Kim Myeong Ho is telling the truth.

434
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,470
Did you go to see her?

435
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,130
What did Choi Seong Mi say?

436
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,060
Yeah. She seemed bewildered when I said your dad

437
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,000
only met her two years ago.

438
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,220
She said they prepared for a crypto business together back in 2019.

439
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,160
Oh, really? Hang on. Here you go.

440
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,590
Seems to be true that your dad was preparing a crypto business in 2019.

441
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,300
Yeah. That was when he was trying to invest in crypto.

442
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,800
That's how he got scammed.

443
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,480
If you look here,

444
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,120
there's even a partnership contract from back then.

445
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Did you verify the seal on this contract?

446
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,490
Yeah, I did.

447
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,670
It matches Hui Ji's dad's official corporate seal.

448
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,280
The victims' statements also align with Choi Seong Mi's version.

449
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,900
Hey, Hui Ji, based on just the evidence,

450
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,770
Choi Seong Mi's story sounds more plausible than your dad's.

451
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,300
Timeline-wise,

452
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,800
your dad got scammed while working with her in a crypto business.

453
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,520
The real issue is

454
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,800
whether your dad made that kind of offer again

455
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,850
to Choi Seong Mi recently...

456
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,870
That's the core issue. Right?

457
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,540
Wait, do you believe this contract is real?

458
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,280
We have to consider the possibility.

459
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,840
But my dad said he didn't know Choi Seong Mi back then.

460
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,180
Then, he must not know about this contract.

461
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,580
First, the seal matches,

462
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,940
and the context fits for the existence of this contract.

463
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,840
If you look here,

464
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,100
his transactions with her first appeared around two years ago.

465
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,420
Nothing in 2022.

466
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,430
His first transaction took place in 2023.

467
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,810
It's weird that he'd do business with someone

468
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,450
he'd never had any transactions.

469
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,660
And no transactions since, either.

470
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,000
These are only circumstantial evidence.

471
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,900
But we can still look more into the context.

472
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,630
There may come a point where he has to admit guilt.

473
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,350
Then, you know how denying this

474
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,410
objective evidence could affect sentencing.

475
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,610
You need to stay level-headed.

476
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,430
Okay, how about we keep both possibilities open and go from there?

477
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,390
Yes. Hui Ji makes sense, and so does Ju Hyeong.

478
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,800
Then, for now,

479
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,640
let's object to the contract being admitted as evidence.

480
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Once we agree to it, it's hard to take it back.

481
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,190
I'll write the formal objection, so let's go with that.

482
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,040
Okay.

483
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,310
Hey.

484
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,500
This is Hui Ji's dad.

485
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,240
Aren't you treating him too much like any other client?

486
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,430
If I treat him differently, that's even worse.

487
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,540
- Still...
- I haven't concluded yet, either.

488
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,580
I'm saying that's what the evidence shows so far.

489
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,090
Hey.

490
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,380
Senior.

491
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,460
You look exhausted. Are you okay?

492
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,620
Yeah, I'm fine.

493
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,440
I heard you worked late last night, too.

494
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,210
Yeah, I was catching up on a bunch of work at once.

495
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,580
Yes, this is Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

496
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,870
You're Mr. Lee Sang Hun, right?

497
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,760
I'll finalize that draft and send it to you today.

498
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,180
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

499
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,100
Oh, right...

500
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,870
It's the summary.

501
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,200
The victims contacted me.

502
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,820
- They contacted you directly?
- Yeah.

503
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,180
They said if we want to reduce your dad's sentence,

504
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,830
we'd better pay a settlement fast.

505
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,480
Let's hear from Kim Myeong Ho's counsel regarding the evidence.

506
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,300
You're objecting to the statements from the victims and Choi Seong Mi

507
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,700
and also to the contract?

508
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,640
- Yes.
- All right, your objection is noted.

509
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,950
Prosecutor, please proceed with arranging witness examination accordingly.

510
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,010
Yes, Your Honor.

511
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,070
Then, the next hearing will be held on March 18, 2025, at 4:00 p.m.

512
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,550
for witness questioning.

513
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,980
Ms. Choi Seong Mi is also a defendant,

514
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,610
but we'll examine her as a witness.

515
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,150
The victims will follow after.

516
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,550
I don't want Hui Ji to come to court.

517
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,070
May I ask why?

518
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,930
I'm wondering if it's relevant to the truth of the case.

519
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,650
If any of what Choi Seong Mi is saying is true,

520
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,190
please tell me now

521
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,920
so I can prepare accordingly.

522
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,060
It's not like that.

523
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,900
Then, why don't you want Kang Hui Ji present?

524
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,070
No, it's not like that. Please, I'm begging you.

525
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,710
Please...

526
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,000
President Shin...

527
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,650
Do you know how it feels to show your daughter

528
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,250
a side of yourself you're ashamed of?

529
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,970
Is my dad okay?

530
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,930
He worries a lot about you.

531
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:19,180
He doesn't want you to come to the hearings.

532
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,260
Of course.

533
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,280
He's always worried about me.

534
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,830
It was upsetting because I assessed the situation too coldheartedly. Right?

535
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,650
No.

536
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,030
I know all of that was for my dad's sake.

537
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,680
I don't get how something like this could happen again.

538
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:51,220
Back then, he must have struggled so much on his own.

539
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,180
People flocked to him, fearing they'd lose their money.

540
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,830
He couldn't bear it and ended up shutting down his business.

541
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,990
Even after he closed the business,

542
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,950
I noticed that the company stayed registered in the records.

543
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,150
My dad really cherished his company.

544
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,180
Maybe because he named it after me.

545
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,090
That's why he used the

546
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,600
same corporate name again when he restarted his business.

547
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,480
Did you ever revisit that case after becoming an attorney?

548
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,470
I didn't really want to look into it

549
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,580
because I thought it'd be painful to wonder

550
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,380
if I could've stopped it then

551
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,370
if I knew what I know now.

552
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:53,780
It looks like your dad did keep cash on hand at the company.

553
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,120
I went through years of account records,

554
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,850
and there were frequent large cash withdrawals.

555
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,200
So, the claim about loaning money in cash makes sense somewhat.

556
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,360
He didn't receive the investment money,

557
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,790
but he got back the money he loaned out.

558
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,950
- Hello?
- Seriously, do you know what time it is?

559
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,000
This is Mr. Lee Sang Hun, right?

560
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,850
"I'll get it to you today, I'll get it to you today."

561
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,200
You've been saying that for days now!

562
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,380
I'm sorry. I'll get it to you today—

563
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,360
I'll send it as soon as I finish it. I'm sorry.

564
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,280
Yes, I'm really sorry.

565
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,720
What's going on?

566
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,940
I have something urgent to take care of. I'll take off first.

567
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,110
Hui Ji! Hui Ji!

568
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,980
At least, eat before you go...

569
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,940
Gosh, I don't think she even took a bite.

570
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,200
Yes?

571
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,870
Are you very busy?

572
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,910
Yeah, Senior. What's up?

573
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,130
Just because.

574
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,560
It's an embezzlement case.

575
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,210
Yeah.

576
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,840
Move.

577
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,290
What?

578
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,930
Let's take a look...

579
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,300
You're organizing the list of claims to submit with the complainant's opinion, right?

580
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,910
- Yeah, that's right.
- Move.

581
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,760
I said, move. Hurry up.

582
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,490
Gosh.

583
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,450
I can do it.

584
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,250
Leave it to me.

585
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,310
It's better for you to go and talk about your father's case.

586
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,730
Hurry up and go!

587
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,030
Thanks, Senior.

588
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,800
Let's break it down one by one.

589
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,710
If Choi Seong Mi's story is true, versus if Hui Ji's dad's story is true.

590
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,030
If Choi Seong Mi is right,

591
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,280
she tried a similar business with your father before.

592
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
And this time, she persuaded people to invest

593
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,520
while he explained the business structure to the victims.

594
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,000
And the past contract is the evidence for that.

595
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,150
The victims' statements also count as evidence.

596
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,150
Since they match Choi Seong Mi's story.

597
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,660
Gosh, you're right.

598
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,720
So, the problem is the victims' testimonies.

599
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,580
If Hui Ji's dad's story is right, what about the victim's statements?

600
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,630
Then, the victims aren't victims.

601
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,780
- What?
- If my dad is right,

602
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,360
those testimonies are false.

603
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,070
That means the victims are no longer just victims.

604
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,040
Let's try meeting them.

605
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,280
- Right now?
- Yeah.

606
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,740
Where did you first meet Kim Myeong Ho?

607
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,160
While doing volunteer work.

608
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,370
Do the two of you also run businesses?

609
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:13,350
No, we just have regular jobs.

610
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,060
Well...

611
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,410
The volunteer organization chaired by

612
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,660
Kim Myeong Ho is for businesspeople, though.

613
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,050
The organization that CEO Kim chairs was formed recently.

614
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,930
We met at another volunteer activity.

615
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,870
Are you happy now?

616
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,170
He said it would give us a lot of earnings

617
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,660
and to send the money through Choi Seong Mi.

618
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,830
Choi Seong Mi used that as an excuse

619
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:43,540
to ask for kickbacks from us.

620
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,390
So, why didn't you send the money directly to Kim Myeong Ho?

621
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,830
You knew Choi Seong Mi very briefly

622
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,860
and she even demanded kickbacks, yet you still accepted her terms?

623
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,710
What are you doing right now?

624
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:00,890
We thought you were going to talk about a settlement.

625
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,710
If Hui Ji's dad is telling the truth,

626
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,980
what about that 2019 contract?

627
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,480
Back then, he must have struggled so much on his own.

628
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,920
He couldn't bear it and ended up shutting down his business.

629
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,390
Kang Hui Ji said her father was scammed and closed the business,

630
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,460
then restarted it about four or five years ago.

631
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,760
You mean, he signed a contract when he was about to close his business?

632
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,270
When did you first meet Choi Seong Mi?

633
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,960
About two years ago?

634
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,320
If he got acquainted with Choi Seong Mi only recently, as Hui Ji's dad said,

635
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,480
would she know about his business closing in the past?

636
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,890
Right. She wouldn't know what happened back then if they met recently.

637
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,530
Choi Seong Mi is lying.

638
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,760
But why are the victims also lying?

639
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,310
That's what I don't understand.

640
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,500
Who says that we're lying?

641
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,160
Did she say you'd get your money back

642
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,100
by accusing Kim Myeong Ho of being a fraudster?

643
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,680
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

644
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,720
Getting your money back like that

645
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,140
won't resolve the pain you feel.

646
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,710
You'll become the deceiver instead of the deceived.

647
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,190
How I feel doesn't matter.

648
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,170
Right now, the money matters.

649
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,280
Let's go.

650
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,070
I beg you.

651
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,680
Please tell the truth.

652
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,430
I'm sorry.

653
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,710
Are you okay?

654
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,230
Yeah.

655
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,330
Come on, tell me.

656
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,650
It's just that...

657
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,760
I feel like I'm seeing my family from the past.

658
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,790
I've seen how painful it is to be the one deceived

659
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,310
rather than the one deceiving.

660
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,920
Losing your lifetime savings at once is unbearable.

661
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,150
At that point, people want their money back

662
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,090
more than they want the scammer punished.

663
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,260
You've been through a lot, Hui Ji.

664
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,150
Everyone's probably waiting for us.

665
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,530
Should we buy some late-night snacks?

666
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,530
- Let's do that.
- All right. My treat.

667
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,980
What do you want to eat?

668
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,230
What do you want to eat, Unni?

669
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,010
Here. Let me take a look.

670
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,640
- Hey, Chang Won.
- Yeah?

671
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,030
Look at the one from two years ago.

672
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,710
Okay. Hey, Ju Hyeong.

673
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,920
If you look at this...

674
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,550
Gosh, this is...

675
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,040
Yeah, it was around then.

676
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,340
Let's go.

677
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,260
Okay. Eat this first.

678
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,030
Hey.

679
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,500
Attorney Jo. Attorney Jo!

680
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,590
What is it?

681
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,920
I think this way is much better.

682
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,820
This and this.

683
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,630
It's correct.

684
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,910
This one's right for now.

685
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,280
That is all.

686
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,850
Kim Myeong Ho's counsel, your cross-examination.

687
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,500
Yes.

688
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,680
Witness, you said you planned a crypto business with the defendant in 2019,

689
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,090
and the defendant asked you for help to do it again.

690
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,660
Is that correct?

691
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,110
Yes, that's correct.

692
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,480
On the left is the supposed contract from back then.

693
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,640
On the right is a recent tax invoice from Kim Myeong Ho's company.

694
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,120
The business registration numbers are the same, right?

695
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,190
Yes, I would assume so.

696
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,650
Witness, were you aware that

697
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,550
Kim Myeong Ho's company had closed in July 2019?

698
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,170
Closed?

699
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,000
Here's a tax invoice from January 11, 2019.

700
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,230
That registration number disappeared when the company closed,

701
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:55,270
and from October 2020, a new number was used.

702
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,790
So, how could a contract written in 2019

703
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,730
have a number that only appeared in 2020.

704
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,140
You borrowed 900 million won from Kim Myeong Ho's company, right?

705
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,060
You needed to repay that to get your collateral back,

706
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,170
but you had no money, so you scammed

707
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,220
the victims for 900 million won under the pretense of investment. Correct?

708
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,900
- No, that's not true.
- Witness,

709
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,460
after you repaid your loan,

710
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,400
you got the IOU back from Kim Myeong Ho. Right?

711
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,770
Did you create a copy of the seal from the IOU and forge that contract?

712
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,260
In order to frame defendant Kim Myeong Ho?

713
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,310
No, I didn't!

714
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,290
I wonder if there's any credibility to the witness's testimony.

715
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,120
That is all.

716
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,000
The witness told police that the defendant, Kim Myeong Ho,

717
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,020
urged you to invest in the crypto business. Right?

718
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,890
Yes.

719
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:14,260
You saw how Choi Seong Mi's lies were exposed earlier. Right?

720
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,370
Is what you told the police true?

721
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,400
The credibility of Choi Seong Mi's testimony is destroyed.

722
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,200
Think carefully and don't add perjury charges to yourself.

723
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,960
Let me ask again.

724
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,860
Is it true?

725
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,780
Witness, why did you lie?

726
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,820
- Counsel.
- She said she'd get my money back first!

727
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,520
She said she'd give my money back first if I did what she said.

728
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,890
So, you knowingly framed Kim Myeong Ho

729
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,100
when you knew Choi Seong Mi was the culprit?

730
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,340
At first, I didn't.

731
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,300
At first, I really thought I invested with CEO Kim.

732
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,340
But thinking back, CEO Kim never even mentioned crypto.

733
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,350
All he did was just go along with what Choi Seong Mi said.

734
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,310
So, when you confronted Choi Seong Mi,

735
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,500
did she tell you to frame Kim Myeong Ho?

736
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,610
When I asked her what happened,

737
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,970
she said she had no money to pay us back.

738
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,420
Even if she went to prison, we wouldn't get our money back.

739
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,990
She said to listen to her if we want to get some money back.

740
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,860
I didn't know things would go this far.

741
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,870
I'm sorry.

742
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,900
Hi.

743
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,990
- What is this?
- Get in.

744
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,570
Your struggles are over today.

745
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,260
Hurry up and get in.

746
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,940
Hey, a different attorney got in earlier, and it was so awkward.

747
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,700
We went up and down a few times.

748
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,250
We were holding the elevator.

749
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,370
Really?

750
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,290
We'll proceed with the afternoon verdict.

751
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:07,740
Case number 2025-Gohap-194.

752
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,390
Defendants Kim Myeong Ho and Choi Seong Mi.

753
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:17,340
The court sentences the defendant Choi Seong Mi to seven years in prison.

754
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,400
Defendant Kim Myeong Ho is found not guilty.

755
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,940
Eat up.

756
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,500
You really went through a lot.

757
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,630
Hui Ji had it the hardest.

758
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,470
I'm sorry that I did this again.

759
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,350
Dad.

760
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,180
You've always been a good dad.

761
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,780
Stop trying so hard and lean on me now.

762
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,310
Hurry up and eat. Eat up.

763
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,480
Okay?

764
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:14,570
It's on me today!

765
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,440
I'm paying today. Everyone eat up!

766
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,950
I picked the menu.

767
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,980
No, rather, my baby did.

768
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,540
Thank you all so much. I couldn't have done this alone.

769
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,740
Come on, it was because you did great.

770
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,600
Anyway, looking good.

771
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,760
Senior, your plate.

772
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,200
Thank you.

773
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,420
Thank you.

774
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,840
Gosh, how long do we have to play ignorant?

775
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,090
I know, right? We're attorneys. We're quick.

776
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:07,230
Yeah. So, should we wait a little longer or what?

777
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,900
A-About that...

778
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,590
If you know already, no need to say anything.

779
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,380
Today, instead of food photos,

780
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,020
I'll take photos of you two.

781
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,820
- Could you come together?
- Get close.

782
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,970
Get closer together. Okay.

783
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:36,400
All right. Two, three!

784
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,720
Gosh, you two look great together.

785
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,720
- What's up?
- Surprise!

786
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,590
- What is this?
- It's fruit.

787
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,140
You said you wanted fruit this morning.

788
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,330
Just in case, I cut up a bunch.

789
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,400
Eat it little by little whenever you want.

790
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,710
Thanks.

791
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,380
I'll be heading out.

792
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:19,790
Oh, right. When can you start using your maternity leave?

793
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:21,400
- Maternity leave?
- Yeah.

794
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,850
Do I start thinking about that already?

795
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:26,000
It came up while talking to the doctors.

796
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,180
It's better to plan things in advance because of our schedule.

797
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,830
I haven't thought about it.

798
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:36,270
That's okay. Think it over slowly while eating the fruit.

799
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,820
- Okay.
- Then, I'll be going.

800
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,500
See you.

801
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,760
Press one.

802
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,120
Right! Bye!

803
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,550
Maternity leave?

804
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,770
Yes, come in.

805
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:33,980
What's going on?

806
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:39,410
Mr. Na, what's the process for applying for maternity or parental leave?

807
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:43,350
Not sure. I don't think that's ever been a thing here.

808
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,700
Not even once?

809
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,650
No, usually people just resigned. Why?

810
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,430
Are you pregnant?

811
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,930
Yes, it's still been only a few weeks.

812
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,140
Then, you still have some time.

813
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,680
Let's talk about it again later.

814
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,020
But this is a legal right.

815
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,400
Is this something to discuss later?

816
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,090
Come on, you know how this works.

817
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,290
How many cases are you handling right now?

818
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,800
About 50.

819
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,060
What do we do with those?

820
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,350
Should Attorney An and I split them 25 each

821
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,780
when we already have 50 each?

822
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,450
And it's not easy to hire a temporary attorney for just three or six months.

823
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:25,260
Not that I want to, either.

824
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:29,260
You know clients don't like it when their attorney keeps changing.

825
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:32,190
That's true, but this is my legal right.

826
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,920
I know it's your right, Attorney Bae.

827
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,930
Okay, I'll seriously consider it.

828
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:42,340
Since we have some time, let's discuss it again later.

829
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:44,390
Yes, this is Na Kyeong Min.

830
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,590
Yes, yes.

831
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:50,720
I sent that to you yesterday.

832
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,110
Yes, I sent you an email.

833
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:01,360
Well, I understand, but if you say it like that...

834
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,940
Yes.

835
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,880
- Will you arrange that tomorrow?
- Oh, sorry!

836
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,030
Yes, I think it's best to coordinate during your visit.

837
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,030
Yes. Okay.

838
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,470
All right.

839
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,710
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

840
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,640
Yes, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

841
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,530
He's not available right now.

842
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,090
Yes, sorry about that.

No, I'll handle it.

Your mom's not feeling well today, so I'm covering for her.
