2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,500
Did you know that Attorney Ha was from a conglomerate family?

3
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,900
I had no idea.

4
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,670
I just found out from the article.

5
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,670
I was honestly so shocked.

6
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,910
How can someone be so two-faced? It's so scary.

7
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,310
You're not secretly an heir, either, right?

8
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,670
Let's stop... and get back to work.

9
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,000
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Okay.

10
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,250
Can I get an egg?

11
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,880
Sure.

12
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,260
Are they reporters?

13
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,260
Isn't that Hanguk Group's secretariat?

14
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,530
Read the room.

15
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,200
What?

16
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,300
- What?
- Nothing.

17
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,070
Work together?

18
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,600
I've never co-counseled a case before.

19
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,740
Okay then.

20
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,390
Since they only have one associate, Attorney Kang Hui Ji will take that side.

21
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,810
Since we have two associates,

22
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,860
I'll check with Attorney Bae on our side.

23
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,260
I'll just take it.

24
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,650
The Advisor gave us this case under the condition

25
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,600
that we co-counsel it with another floor.

26
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,900
There he comes.

27
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,870
I guess you decided to take it, Attorney An.

28
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,710
- Am I working with An Ju Hyeong?
- Yeah.

29
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,310
You two know each other, right?

30
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,840
Yes.

31
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,800
Now that I see you like this, you guys look great together.

32
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,230
Pardon?

33
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,140
Well then, please take good care of Attorney Kang.

34
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,360
Please keep it professional.

35
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,820
Well, which side do we need to represent?

36
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,510
The plaintiff, Kang Chang Jun.

37
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,290
Hey, say something, damn it!

38
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,400
Why don't you listen when I tell you something?

39
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,940
How many times did I tell you?

40
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,780
What? Are you offended?

41
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,600
Damn it, you won't even answer me.

42
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,730
I said answer me, asshole!

43
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,770
You asshole!

44
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,060
Get up, get up, you asshole.

45
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,780
(Police in Korea)

46
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,860
We got a report about a fight.

47
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,290
Thank you for your service.

48
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,470
Yes, hello.

49
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,940
But there's really no problem here.

50
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,030
It's okay. I think you can go now.

51
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,370
There's no issue here.

52
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,970
If you come down here like this...

53
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,020
Are those the two who were fighting?

54
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,560
No, no. There's no problem.

55
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,370
Have you ever seen him hit people before?

56
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,190
No, it was the first time.

57
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,000
If it happened before, I wouldn't have been shocked. But...

58
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,040
he was beating him like an animal.

59
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,560
So, I felt compelled to call the police. But now...

60
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,660
the guy who got beaten up says he wasn't hit.

61
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,280
And you were told not to come starting the next day?

62
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
Yes.

63
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,110
After he found out I called the police, he told me right away not to come.

64
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,150
Did he give you a reason?

65
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,790
I'm sure he didn't say it was because you reported it.

66
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,690
He didn't give any reasons. He just said. "Don't come."

67
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,710
What did I do wrong that I should leave?

68
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,650
Isn't this what you call a wrongful dismissal?

69
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,800
Right, Attorney?

70
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,220
Put everything else aside,

71
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,110
they didn't follow any of the proper procedures for dismissal.

72
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,040
So wouldn't it be easiest to focus on that aspect?

73
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,630
It's true they didn't follow the dismissal procedures under the Labor Standards Act.

74
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,970
Then, isn't it resolved?

75
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,720
But the issue is whether we can establish Kang Chang Jun as a worker.

76
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,490
He's a club DJ. Does he qualify as a worker under the law?

77
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,200
Oh, worker classification.

78
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,600
You're right.

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,380
We need to get that recognized first.

80
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,200
But from what we've heard so far, it's vague.

81
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,780
He has no employment contract, no national insurance,

82
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,180
no solid way to prove his working hours,

83
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,590
and he wasn't working every day, either.

84
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,750
What about pay? He must've been paid, right?

85
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,040
Yeah, he probably was.

86
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,310
But because his shifts weren't regular,

87
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,130
his pay probably varied month to month.

88
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,310
Then, it won't look like a fixed salary.

89
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,710
More like he was paid per performance.

90
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,660
Exactly. Even if we prove that he was a worker,

91
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,710
since it currently looks like Kang Chang Jun falsely reported Lee Dong Su,

92
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,640
they might argue that the dismissal wasn't wrongful.

93
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,460
Even if this dismissal is invalid due to not following the procedure,

94
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,000
they could follow the procedure next time and fire him again for the same reason.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,660
That's right. That's the issue.

96
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,380
Then, should we meet that person first?

97
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,170
- Who?
- The guy who got hit. Jeong Min Gyu.

98
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,090
Where?

99
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,900
- You came dressed like this?
- I should ask you that.

100
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,550
Of course. I came to work. How else?

101
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,350
We should hide that we're here for work.

102
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,400
At least take off your tie.

103
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
- Geez, why should I take off my tie?
- Just listen to me.

104
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,740
And let's open the top two buttons.

105
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,050
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

106
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,860
Take off that jacket.

107
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,470
Take off my jacket, too? It's cold!

108
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,620
- Take it off.
- Okay.

109
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,880
Much better.

110
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,380
But did we really have to come here?

111
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,060
Kang Chang Jun doesn't know his number, either.

112
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm sure we could've found out somehow.

113
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,600
We don't have time to wait for that. Let's go.

114
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,760
You said you came to work.

115
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,040
Excuse me, is Jeong Min Gyu here?

116
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,270
Who?

117
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,550
Jeong Min Gyu.

118
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,050
Try over there.

119
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,160
Excuse me.

120
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,950
Hi. Are you looking for the restroom?

121
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,070
This area is for staff only. You can't be here.

122
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,390
You're Jeong Min Gyu, right?

123
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
- Who are you?
- You know Kang Chang Jun, right?

124
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,530
- Yes.
- We're Kang Chang Jun's attorneys.

125
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,760
When you were assaulted, he called the police

126
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,520
and got fired.

127
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,080
- Fired?
- Yes.

128
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,270
So, we were hoping to hear from you about what happened.

129
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,920
He misunderstood and reported by mistake.

130
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,090
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy.

131
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,460
We can help you as well, Jeong Min Gyu.

132
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,450
I got hit because I deserved it.

133
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,270
It's not a big deal.

134
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,010
It's not serious enough to need your help, Attorneys.

135
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,120
Next time you come,

136
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,570
let me get you a table and enjoy yourselves.

137
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,820
That's how you can help me.

138
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,250
I don't know what took place,

139
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,030
but there's no such thing as deserving a beating.

140
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
No matter what you did,

141
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Lee Dong Su had no right to hit you.

142
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,580
So, if you change your mind, please call me.

143
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,340
Who are you?

144
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,630
This area is only for staff. You can't be here.

145
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,720
Where did you come from?

146
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,080
Are you hiring DJs?

147
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
I heard there was an opening.

148
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,990
- A DJ?
- I wasn't sure who I needed to talk to.

149
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,710
Both of you?

150
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,300
You don't hire teams?

151
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,300
"Are you hiring DJs?"

152
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,960
"You don't hire teams?"

153
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,940
I had no choice because you started out with DJs.

154
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,470
You should've said we're the DJ and manager.

155
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,350
- Called you my manager?
- No, you'd be my manager.

156
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,490
Well, anyone can see that you'd be my manager, and I'd be the DJ.

157
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,600
You don't look like a DJ, either.

158
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,230
In any case, do you think he'll call?

159
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,090
It won't be easy to get his testimony.

160
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,140
We'll have to wait and see.

161
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,700
I still have my wristband on.

162
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,950
- Give me your arm.
- No, it's all right.

163
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,780
Come on.

164
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,890
I guess you've gone clubbing quite a bit.

165
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,070
Yes. You haven't?

166
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,480
No.

167
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,260
And you said you were a DJ?

168
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,400
I'm getting off here.

169
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,500
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

170
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,050
Hello, Attorney.

171
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,020
- Hello, sir.
- You're coming in now?

172
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,770
Yes. Are you going somewhere?

173
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,960
I ran out of coffee this morning,

174
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,500
so I'm heading to the store to restock.

175
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,830
Chief, would you like this?

176
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,410
It's perfect instead of coffee on an empty stomach.

177
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,900
Goodness, thank you.

178
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,380
Hello.

179
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,540
How long will it take?

180
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,200
Just a moment.

181
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
Security Chief, what's all this?

182
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,250
Oh, this?

183
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,890
They're installing a base station in our building.

184
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,490
Oh, really?

185
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,560
Apparently, the rent for this is quite high.

186
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,450
Then, will the Advisor give you a bonus?

187
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,520
Gosh, I can't expect such a thing.

188
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
Go on your way, Attorney.

189
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,610
Yes. Have a good day.

190
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,460
Thank you.

191
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,500
Is there anything else you need?

192
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,840
This should be enough to work with.

193
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,830
Also, if the dismissal is ruled wrongful,

194
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,730
you can claim back wages for the time you couldn't work.

195
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,430
We'll include that in the claim.

196
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,420
No.

197
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,340
All I need is a ruling that proves

198
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,070
that my dismissal was baseless and that I did nothing wrong.

199
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,700
I don't want to be paid for the time I didn't work.

200
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,270
This is your legal right as the one who was

201
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,570
wrongfully dismissed, Kang Chang Jun.

202
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,890
You don't have to think like that.

203
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,180
All I want is to work there again with my head held high.

204
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,510
But do you really want to go back there?

205
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,070
Yes.

206
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,590
After all I went through to come from the countryside

207
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,460
to make it to a club in Hongdae?

208
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,380
There's no reason I can't keep working there.

209
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,500
I've done nothing wrong.

210
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,480
Okay, then we'll proceed with only invalidating the dismissal.

211
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,150
Thank you.

212
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,390
Yes, this is Hyungmin Law Group.

213
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,440
Okay. May I ask who's calling?

214
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,680
Yes?

215
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,440
A school senior?

216
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,770
Okay, then connect me.

217
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,570
Yes, I'm on the line.

218
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,430
Is this Attorney Ha Sang Ki?

219
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,800
Yes. That's right.

220
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,190
I'm Director Lee Min Woo from HR Hunting.

221
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm a headhunter.

222
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,370
You graduated from Gwangseong University Law School, right?

223
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm an alum, too.

224
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,290
Oh, I see.

225
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry, but what is this about?

226
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,310
A startup that just completed Series C funding

227
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,540
wants to bring you onboard as a director-level legal counsel.

228
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,990
What do you think?

229
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,900
The compensation will be at an executive-level at a major corporation.

230
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,260
Me?

231
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,560
Yes.

232
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,130
They specifically asked for you.

233
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,450
That's why I'm calling.

234
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,310
Well, I've never worked in-house before.

235
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,920
But why me, though?

236
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,980
Well, they're looking to build a relationship with Hanguk Group.

237
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,910
It appears they're hoping you could help with that.

238
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,810
I'm sorry. I'm going to hang up.

239
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,980
Can I say something about that?

240
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,950
Yes, what are you referring to?

241
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,940
The article...

242
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,610
Is it true?

243
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,390
It's not.

244
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,240
Okay.

245
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,600
That will be our stance, then.

246
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,130
- Let me know if anything uncomfortable comes up.
- It's all good.

247
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,800
Okay.

248
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,200
Gosh, it's freezing.

249
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,270
He's here, he's here.

250
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,940
Where's Sang Ki?

251
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,570
He said something urgent came up. He said we can start.

252
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,820
So...

253
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,220
no one is going to say anything about Sang Ki?

254
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,300
He asked us to overlook it.

255
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
- Is that what that meant?
- Of course.

256
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,870
I told you to read the room.

257
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,000
- Is yours bulgogi?
- Yeah.

258
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,290
Swap with me.

259
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,850
Okay.

260
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,660
But did you guys know?

261
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,380
No, we didn't know.

262
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,380
Did you know, Oppa?

263
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,250
No, I didn't know.

264
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,180
I was the most clueless.

265
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,960
Why are you getting all upset about?

266
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,550
He didn't want us to know.

267
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,820
Yeah, let's give Senior Sang Ki some time.

268
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,540
What's wrong with you now?

269
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,710
Damn it.

270
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,870
Going home now?

271
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,350
Yeah.

272
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,520
You should've told me at least.

273
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
- What do you mean?
- That my family

274
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,430
made money subcontracting for your family.

275
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,860
It must've been so funny to you every time I brought it up.

276
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,560
- It's not like that.
- Even if you didn't feel that way,

277
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,370
now that I've found out this way,

278
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,700
I can't help but think that.

279
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,680
It's not like that.

280
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,450
Then, what is it?

281
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,460
What are you trying to do?

282
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,400
You still have nothing to say to me?

283
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,900
Even if it's not about my family,

284
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,830
I thought we were closer than just work colleagues.

285
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,710
I thought we could talk openly about anything.

286
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,560
I don't talk about my family with just anyone.

287
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,540
I told you because it was you.

288
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,920
I guess I was the only one who thought we were friends.

289
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,730
I'm sorry.

290
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,570
In response to the plaintiff's claims,

291
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,110
the defendant has denied the plaintiff's worker status,

292
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,670
and the plaintiff has submitted evidence to prove it.

293
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

294
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,300
Plaintiff's counsel,

295
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,640
could you briefly explain your evidence?

296
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,890
Yes. First, please take a look at

297
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,060
Exhibit No. 3, the plaintiff's transit card records.

298
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,950
They show that he consistently arrived and left

299
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,490
at the same time each day at the defendant's club.

300
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,020
If you look at Exhibit No. 4, the plaintiff's cell tower data,

301
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,630
...it shows his location at Seogyo-dong in Mapo-gu during commuting hours,

302
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,860
and the defendant's club is located in Seogyo-dong.

303
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,920
The plaintiff had fixed working hours

304
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,320
even when he wasn't performing.

305
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,760
His pay may appear inconsistent month to month,

306
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,980
but it directly correlates with the days he worked,

307
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,810
and you can see that it has nothing to do with the number of performances.

308
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,960
This proves it was a salary for coming into work

309
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,260
rather than as payments for gigs.

310
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,580
Moreover, if you look at the text details between the plaintiff and defendant,

311
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,900
you can see the plaintiff worked under the direct supervision of the defendant.

312
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,360
You also do the 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. slots.

313
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,950
I'm telling you to do them because the other guy can't make it.

314
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,960
Why complain? There's not much to do. Just go home.

315
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,160
- Defendant's counsel?
- Yes?

316
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,770
Are those text messages actually from the defendant?

317
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,560
- Defendant's counsel?
- Were they sent by the defendant?

318
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,940
Attorney?

319
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,900
Who are you talking to?

320
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,120
The defendant, Mr. Lee Dong Su.

321
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,880
Are you the defendant himself?

322
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,580
- Yes.
- Please come up to the front.

323
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,550
- Defendant's counsel?
- Yes?

324
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,730
Did you know he was sitting in the back?

325
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,090
Well...

326
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,080
If the defendant is present, he should sit in the front.

327
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,350
Why were you in the back?

328
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,770
Does it mean you have something to hide?

329
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,170
No, it's not like that.

330
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,150
You didn't follow the proper dismissal procedure, right?

331
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,320
He's not a worker, so it wasn't a dismissal.

332
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,820
Did you follow the proper procedure?

333
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,820
How's a club DJ a worker?

334
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,870
I guess you weren't listening despite sitting back there.

335
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,800
That's what we've just been proving.

336
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,940
Kang Chang Jun is a worker.

337
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,550
All right, plaintiff's counsel.

338
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,330
Please refrain from addressing the defendant directly.

339
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,940
Yes. I'm sorry.

340
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,090
Great work today.

341
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,540
Hello, Advisor.

342
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,900
I stopped by out of curiosity.

343
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,400
- You were really prepared.
- Yes.

344
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,350
Hey, I've got records of your false police report.

345
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,670
I could just fire you again with those.

346
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,240
Jeong Min Gyu gave us his full testimony.

347
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
He admitted there was an assault

348
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,990
and that the report wasn't false.

349
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,250
I came because what you said the other day stuck with me,

350
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,870
but I don't think I can do this.

351
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,350
If I give you my statement,

352
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,390
do you think I can keep working there?

353
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,280
Kang Chang Jun reported it

354
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,440
in order to help you.

355
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,780
Did I ask for his help?

356
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,080
Others are trying to help you like this.

357
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,190
Why won't you take care of yourself?

358
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,680
There's no such thing as "deserving to be hit."

359
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,440
You don't have to testify for us.

360
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,990
But at least protect yourself.

361
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,160
I'll help you.

362
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,500
Min Gyu, that jerk...

363
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,200
A complaint from Jeong Min Gyu will also be filed soon.

364
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,790
Just leave me alone!

365
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,120
Why do you keep following me around! So annoying...

366
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,110
How does Lee Dong Su know the Advisor?

367
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,410
Who's the Advisor?

368
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,110
You don't know Advisor Kim Hyeong Min?

369
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,920
No, I don't.

370
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,010
Really?

371
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,300
Is the Advisor that rich?

372
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,510
She owns this building.

373
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,300
- This building?
- Yeah.

374
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,510
That's amazing.

375
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,780
- Did you know?
- Well, I figured that might be the case.

376
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,110
She's Kim Hyeong Min of the Hyungmin Building.

377
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,000
You're right.

378
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,620
Did you two know, too?

379
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,410
No, I didn't know.

380
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,810
What about you?

381
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,620
I didn't know, either.

382
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm clueless about stuff like that these days.

383
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,360
But what's with your reaction?

384
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,560
This is such big news. This isn't like you.

385
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,240
It's not like I can freak out over everything.

386
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,990
What?

387
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,730
What's wrong with him?

388
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,230
You'll be back here in a few days anyway.

389
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,630
Don't assert your pride.

390
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,800
It'll only eat you up inside.

391
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,630
Hello.

392
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,800
It's you. You may enter.

393
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,830
Hello.

394
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,060
Hello, Managing Partner.

395
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,810
When you said you'd work for the office above for better pay,

396
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,670
I respected that.

397
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,770
It was honest.

398
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,850
They offered more money. Of course, you should go.

399
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,700
Whether it's a floor above or the firm across from us.

400
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,900
However, it now appears that it was all a lie.

401
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,720
If you didn't like our firm, you should've just said so.

402
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
Why did you use your salary as an excuse?

403
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,640
Mr. Seong, it's really not like that.

404
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,850
If you think that because of the article, it's a big misunderstanding.

405
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,540
All right.

406
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,000
- It'll be a bit cold.
- Okay.

407
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,490
She's my daughter.

408
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,700
Oh, I see.

409
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,970
I don't know where to start.

410
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,560
Please take your time.

411
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,320
Or would you prefer that I ask you some questions?

412
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,300
No.

413
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,510
I'll talk.

414
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,760
When she was young,

415
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,680
we sent her to study abroad in the U.S.

416
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,850
In the 8th grade.

417
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,000
I think that's the appropriate place to begin.

418
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,380
Since that turned out to be an error in judgment.

419
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,060
Did Kim Yu Jin go alone?

420
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,520
Yes. We sent her alone.

421
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,120
Her father and I had too much going on here.

422
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,910
We thought sending her, albeit alone, was better for her future.

423
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,410
We trusted she would do well in the U.S.

424
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,910
even if she's alone since she's our daughter.

425
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,130
But that's where she was introduced to drugs.

426
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,710
Yes.

427
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,490
She said she first started in college.

428
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,040
We actually knew early on.

429
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,160
We tried taking her to therapy,

430
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,320
brought her back to Korea to live together,

431
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,760
and we even moved to the States

432
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,440
to stay with her.

433
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,920
But nothing worked.

434
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,810
Then, does Kim Yu Jin have a criminal record for drug use?

435
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,560
No.

436
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,150
This is the first time that she has been arrested.

437
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,360
She was put under immediate arrest.

438
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,970
Where was the location of the arrest?

439
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,950
Incheon Airport.

440
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,550
She was arrested as soon as she landed.

441
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,840
As soon as she landed?

442
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,970
Then, someone probably tipped them off.

443
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,320
Do you know who?

444
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
Yes.

445
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,580
It was me.

446
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,720
Though she is our daughter, our efforts alone weren't enough.

447
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,890
So...

448
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,320
we told her to come to Korea...

449
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,560
and we reported her.

450
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,890
And...

451
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,170
I want her to be released from detention.

452
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,630
That's why I came here.

453
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,450
Please help her, Attorney.

454
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,370
- Heading out now?
- Yeah.

455
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,110
- Heading out now?
- Yeah.

456
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,270
What's with this awkward air?

457
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,400
This is so unfamiliar.

458
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,760
- Hello. Attorney Ha Sang Ki, right?
- Pardon?

459
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,010
We're from News Off.

460
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,290
We're following up on the elite family law school admissions article.

461
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,040
That's not me. You've got the wrong guy.

462
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,060
You have the best background of all the admitted students...

463
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,910
- Hey. Stop. He said no.
- Do you believe you deserved your spot?

464
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,750
- Stop it.
- All right, all right. We get it.

465
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,830
You got the wrong person.

466
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,760
We know it's you, Attorney. Please give us a statement.

467
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,130
I said it's not me.

468
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,400
- Please stop this.
- Why don't you talk with me?

469
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,120
- Mr. Ha Sang Ki.
- You go on.

470
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,290
I said go on.

471
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,500
- It doesn't cost anything to talk!
- Mr. Ha Sang Ki, wait!

472
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,590
I know many fun stories.

473
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,500
Crazy jerk.

474
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,240
At a time like this?

475
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:47,840
When I was in college, my nickname was the Spirit of Spring.

476
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,610
Because I would vanish in the fall

477
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:55,130
and return whenever spring came.

478
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,900
I had to work through the fall

479
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,840
to afford tuition for the spring semester.

480
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,530
That's why it took me eight years to graduate.

481
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,560
I was what they call a "dirt spoon."

482
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,820
During my difficult, impoverished childhood,

483
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,460
studying was all I could do.

484
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,490
Because it felt like the only way out.

485
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,900
After graduation,

486
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,670
I wasn't even planning to go to law school, nor did I have the means.

487
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,690
But after six months of working,

488
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,580
I felt like I had to go back and study.

489
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,850
Maybe I was a Spirit of Spring after all.

490
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,120
If not for the school and third-party scholarships,

491
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,110
I could've never become an attorney.

492
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,630
I'm always thankful for the kindness of strangers

493
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,090
and the support that came through the system.

494
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:06,290
And I hope to pass it on someday.

495
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,700
As for the modern-day nepotism,

496
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,150
I don't really know much about that.

497
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:17,060
All I know is that students study hard

498
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,830
to become good attorneys.

499
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,410
Even the classmate you mistook me for

500
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,360
due to our similar names, probably did the same.

501
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,460
So please, don't criticize him, either.

502
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,940
And I hope no one ever has to

503
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,620
go through what I did tonight,

504
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,340
having to prove their poverty.

505
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,080
One bowl of rice soup, please.

506
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,150
This isn't your dinner, right?

507
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,800
No, I had dinner way earlier.

508
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,760
Then, why don't you just rest?

509
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,340
Why come all the way here this late?

510
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,120
I'm fine.

511
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,840
But you should stop working so late, Mom.

512
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,230
I should keep working as long as the owner lets me work.

513
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,800
Sitting around would only make me sick.

514
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,010
Who gets sick from sitting around?

515
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,230
Working too much makes people ill.

516
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,770
Can I get some more radish kimchi here?

517
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,570
Okay.

518
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,800
Hold on a second.

519
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,120
Have a fried egg before you go.

520
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,470
I recently handled Crystal Park's divorce case.

521
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,510
- What?
- What?

522
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,400
I represented the husband against Crystal Park.

523
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,670
And it ended through mediation.

524
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,640
- Wow!
- Amazing!

525
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,340
I even met her privately afterward and talked to her.

526
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,220
Wow!

527
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,000
Honestly, I've been doing visitation attorney work recently.

528
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,970
- Visitation attorney work?
- You know,

529
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,000
going in like a butler to keep them company,

530
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,540
update them on the outside world and entertain them.

531
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,570
The stuff we're not supposed to do.

532
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,920
- You were doing that?
- Your boss makes you do that?

533
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,030
Exactly.

534
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,060
When I go there now, they don't even check my attorney ID anymore

535
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,110
because I go there so often.

536
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,930
To be honest, I'm pregnant.

537
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,800
- What?
- What?

538
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,700
So, just in case, I haven't taken rhinitis meds,

539
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,120
and stopped drinking coffee. And of course, not alcohol.

540
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,070
I get worried when I'm working late

541
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,390
and even when I'm running around.

542
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,130
Wait, does Ji Seok know?

543
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,530
Hey, since when? How long has it been?

544
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,290
They said six weeks.

545
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,690
I already knew all of this.

546
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,880
- What?
- What? How?

547
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,960
You kept checking your period tracking app

548
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,790
and spitting food out.

549
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:24,690
How about Ju Hyeong's case?

550
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,240
When I ran into him at the family court,

551
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,340
I looked up his case number and party names.

552
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,270
- What about Chang Won?
- He told me that himself.

553
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,090
Wow, seriously.

554
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,540
You're incredible.

555
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,860
But wasn't I the main character today?

556
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,420
- Why would you be?
- Why, Oppa?

557
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,600
Why would you be?

558
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,240
What for?

559
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,690
You probably didn't know, but when I was young, I was really—

560
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,570
We know. You wrote such a long post. Why bring it up again?

561
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,550
You knew about it?

562
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,970
You posted it publicly for everyone to see.

563
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,130
Didn't you ask us to play ignorant?

564
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,730
- Wait, Ha Sang Ki.
- What?

565
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,710
If it took you eight years to graduate

566
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,590
and you worked in between,

567
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,240
then you didn't do military service, did you?

568
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,280
You've been pretending like you did all this time!

569
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,290
I did do military service, man! Six months.

570
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,470
My dad is a National Merit recipient.

571
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,710
The food won't be good if it gets cold.

572
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,160
Okay, we'll eat it right away.

573
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,850
Let's eat.

574
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,090
Crazies...

575
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,050
Hey...

576
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,690
Well...

577
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,000
- Sorry about that.
- No need.

578
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,330
Thanks for what you did yesterday.

579
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,850
Gosh, I take it back.

580
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,550
This is so awkward. Geez...

581
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,070
I didn't mean it, either, you jerk.

582
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,070
I cringed first, you know!

583
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,540
- He's so weird.
- Hey, wait up!

584
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,880
Hey!

585
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,790
Wait up.

586
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,780
I thought you wanted me to ignore it,

587
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,570
but you really weren't?

588
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,850
That's right.

589
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,120
That person wasn't me. I told you so.

590
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,000
Why didn't you deny it more emphatically from the start?

591
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,810
Why did you wait until everyone dragged your name through the mud?

592
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,410
Pardon?

593
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,190
Did you read all the comments, too?

594
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,620
Well, they were visible everywhere.

595
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,010
Was it really that hard to say

596
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,180
that it wasn't you, and it was someone with a similar name?

597
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:50,010
I mean, I just hoped it would blow over.

598
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,740
Honestly,

599
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,640
I didn't want to think about how I grew up poor,

600
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,560
and if I denied it too emphatically,

601
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,980
I felt like I was telling them to criticize that classmate.

602
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,310
I didn't want that, either.

603
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,720
Attorney Ha, I didn't know you had this side.

604
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,580
I thought you were the ultimate individualist.

605
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,630
Yes, it turns out I did.

606
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,270
I see that now.

607
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,330
Yes?

608
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,870
What are you doing? Why are you here in my office?

609
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,250
We're still collaborating on Mr. Kang Chang Jun's case.

610
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,810
But the hearing is over. Our job is done.

611
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,040
There's still the ruling hearing left. It's not over yet.

612
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,250
- Ruling hearing?
- Let's go.

613
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,320
Why would we go to the ruling hearing?

614
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,830
Don't you want to see how it goes?

615
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,860
It's your first collaboration case in ten years.

616
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,310
Let's go. We'll be late.

617
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,270
Gosh, I told you it's nine years, not ten.

618
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,520
All right, fine. Nine years.

619
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,920
Hurry up, let's go.

620
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,480
Fine...

621
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,950
Case number...

622
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,950
2024-Gadan-25134.

623
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,050
Plaintiff Kang Chang Jun.

624
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,240
Defendant Lee Dong Su.

625
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,920
Neither party is present, right?

626
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,670
Here.

627
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,030
Kang Chang Jun's counsel is present?

628
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,700
- Yes.
- And the plaintiff himself is present?

629
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,910
Yes, that is correct.

630
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,800
Very well. I'll now declare the ruling.

631
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:30,070
The dismissal issued to the plaintiff on September 3, 2024, by the defendant

632
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,260
is hereby declared invalid.

633
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,140
The defendant shall bear the litigation costs.

634
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,740
I judge in favor of the plaintiff.

635
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,040
Thank you.

636
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,240
Case number 2024-GaDan-1987.

637
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,090
Plaintiff Botino Inc. Defendant Flik LLC.

638
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,700
Neither party is present, right?

639
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,020
The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

640
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,930
The plaintiff shall bear the litigation costs.

641
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,640
How was it? Aren't you glad you came?

642
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,010
I didn't even do anything there.

643
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,240
We were going to win anyway.

644
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,340
Damn it.

645
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,420
You...

646
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,300
Why did you have to introduce Kim Ji Seok to me?

647
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,330
Now I'm married and pregnant.

648
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,220
Why are you so mad about something to be celebrated?

649
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,810
Who says this is to be celebrated?

650
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,690
Who do you think you are?

651
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,270
And I'm the one who decides how to feel about it.

652
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,350
But I haven't yet, so could you shut up?

653
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,120
Damn it!

654
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,580
Is it that hard?

655
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,520
Yeah, it's hard.

656
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,790
This is making me worry in so many ways.

657
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,510
And I'm not someone with maternal instincts.

658
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,370
I don't think I'd develop any in the future, either.

659
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,300
That's what you're worried about?

660
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,830
Why do you think you need to have maternal instincts?

661
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,920
Of course, I need maternal instincts.

662
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,330
I'll need to raise a child.

663
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:58,530
But you like people in general.

664
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,930
You just swear a lot. That's all.

665
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,390
I'm sure you'll love your child, too.

666
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,940
Why worry so much about that?

667
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,200
It doesn't have to be maternal instincts.

668
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,190
I...

669
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,450
like people in general?

670
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,550
Yeah. You didn't know?

671
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,460
You're oddly kind lately.

672
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,370
No, I'm not.

673
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,440
Attorney.

674
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,110
Mr. Jang Su Gil went to court today.

675
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,330
I hear it's his ruling hearing.

676
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,240
Ruling hearing?

677
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,770
Gosh, you're so funny.

678
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,990
Attorney Jo, you're here?

679
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,620
Wow.

680
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,610
You look way better out here.

681
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,730
- I told you I'd get out, didn't I?
- He got acquitted. Not guilty.

682
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:47,060
I see. Congratulations.

683
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,190
Thanks for the fruit.

684
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,050
Yeah, yeah. Enjoy yourself.

685
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,350
I wasn't joking back then.

686
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,460
Come work for me. I'll treat you well.

687
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,570
See you around.

688
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,070
Please bring this to my office.

689
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,040
What are the prosecutors even doing?

690
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,300
They can't even convict a guy like him.

691
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,180
There were pretty female attorneys here after all.

692
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,880
Why did they send me a guy?

693
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,590
Who the hell is this creep?

694
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,790
Do you know me?

695
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,750
Move!

696
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,980
I'm sorry.

697
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,540
What the hell?

698
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,120
Do I really like people?

699
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,310
Everyone, gather up. My treat.

700
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,380
It's a pregnancy party!

701
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,080
Hello?

702
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,650
Are you home?

703
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,660
I'm heading home on the subway.

704
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,120
Are you still at work?

705
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,010
Yeah, I'm still at work.

706
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,600
I might be a bit late.

707
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,110
I see. Okay.

708
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,140
Is that why you called?

709
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,580
- No.
- Then?

710
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,690
My phone's dying. Tell me quickly.

711
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,210
- What is it?
- I'm pregnant.

712
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,760
Hello?

713
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,170
- Yeah.
- I said I'm pregnant.

714
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,880
They say I'm six weeks in.

715
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,360
Yeah.

716
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,540
That's it.

717
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,010
No one's here yet?

718
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,550
No.

719
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,600
Mun Jeong!

720
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,750
Mun Jeong!

721
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,760
What the...

722
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,600
Why did you come here?

723
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,330
Well...

724
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:52,230
earlier, I was just... so shocked...

725
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,850
s-so shocked...

726
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,090
It was just that I was so shocked.

727
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,490
Well...

728
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,990
But then, my p-phone ran out of battery and died...

729
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,030
I t-thought you might be freaking out...

730
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,460
You're nuts.

731
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,700
Why are you crying?

732
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:21,020
I'm sorry. I-I was just so shocked...

733
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,310
You must've been so scared...

734
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

735
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,880
Then, you're happy that I'm pregnant?

736
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,910
You're happy, right?

737
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:42,510
What kind of question is that? Of course I am!

738
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:50,130
- You're cold, right?
- Yeah, I'm cold.

739
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,400
Let's hurry up and go home.

740
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,310
Watch your head.

741
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,430
Your seatbelt.

742
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,190
Gosh...

743
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,410
It's really cold out today, isn't it?

744
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,520
So, you went home and brought the car?

745
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,450
Yeah, I came out in such a rush.

746
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,480
Drive safely.

747
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,330
You might get into an accident.

748
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,450
Let's feast tonight!

749
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,560
Gosh, you scared me.

750
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,510
It's a bar, man. A bar, not a restaurant.

751
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:55,510
Hey, you think I can't feast at a bar?

752
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,680
What's wrong with you?

753
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,940
Hello, how are you guys?

754
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,360
Hello.

755
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,180
I guess you're going home.

756
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,900
Yes.

757
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,820
Attorney Ha, you must've had a rough time.

758
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,530
Oh, no, not at all.

759
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,610
­

760
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,560
Well then, I'll see you around.

761
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,970
- Okay.
- Okay, good night.

762
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:54,360
So... I'm sorry,

763
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,150
but I have to cancel today's party.

764
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,870
Everyone go home. Don't party without me.

765
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,020
Geez, what's the matter with her?

766
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,420
She says we should all go home.

767
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,240
I saw it, too.

768
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,460
Gosh, seriously...

769
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,540
Maybe we should just grab a drink by ourselves.

770
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,410
Where?

771
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:16,570
Hey, tell me where!

772
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:18,010
Are you buying?

773
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,280
Could you please tell me where we're going?

774
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,430
Could you please stop asking me?

775
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,250
What do you mean? I followed you all this way.

776
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,550
Just come.

777
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,100
All these places are closed.

778
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,170
I know a perfect spot, man.

779
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,350
What is this place?

780
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,260
Is this a hidden gem?

781
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,120
Why come all this way to have rice soup?

782
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,110
Gosh, I'm freezing.

783
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,290
What are you waiting for? Say hello to my mom.

784
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,100
- What?
- Mom, say hi. This is my friend.

785
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,100
- Mom? Y-Your mother?
- Yeah.

786
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,880
H-Hello, ma'am.

787
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,500
M-My name is Jo Chang Won. H-Hello.

788
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,490
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, it's nice to meet you, too.

789
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,330
I'm a good friend of Sang Ki.

790
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:13,740
We eat, get drinks, and do everything together all the time.

791
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,750
- Have a seat.
- Oh, yes, yes.

792
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,610
Come on, feed me already. I'm cold.

793
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:19,020
Thank you. Yes.

794
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,900
Why didn't you tell me? You should've told me sooner!

795
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,680
This place is really good.

796
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,740
It's not my mom's restaurant. She just works part-time here.

797
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,700
- I said, no! I don't want to!
- Come on, just once. Just once.

798
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,100
Let's just do it once.

799
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,140
Goodness, what's with you?

800
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,530
- I want to do it so badly.
- Were you this kind of girl?

801
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,970
It's dangerous. No.

802
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:44,790
How's it dangerous? Let's just do it before the baby gets bigger.

803
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,300
There's no "just once"! We're not doing it!

804
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,810
Okay, wait, wait.

805
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:51,410
You just stay below me. I'll go on top.

806
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,550
You're not considerate of me on the bottom.

807
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,470
- Come on!
- I said, no!

808
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,510
- Please!
- Come on!

809
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,620
All right, it's only for one meter. Okay?

810
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,220
- Okay, okay. Just once.
- Seriously, you...

811
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,320
It's like I'm raising a kid already.

812
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,030
- Hey, my neck's bent! Go down!
- Are you okay?

813
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:09,660
- Gosh, this is so high.
- Are you okay?

814
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,890
Hey, hold on tight. I'm going to try leaning back.

815
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,120
Hey, try moving forward.

816
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,540
- Stop it. Hey!
- Move forward.

817
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,290
Spiderman. Spiderman.

818
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,550
Hey, this is so much fun!

819
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,040
- What's so fun about this?
- Gosh, this is so fun.

820
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,210
Quiet, Bae Mun Jeong! The neighbors will complain!

821
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,070
- Hey, too high. You okay? Be careful!
- Let's go. Go, go.

822
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,300
The more I think about it, the more ridiculous this is.

823
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,880
A pregnancy party sounded strange to start with.

824
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,750
Then...

825
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,250
let's call it a first successful collaboration celebration.

826
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,760
First successful collaboration celebration?

827
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,860
That's a mouthful.

828
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,510
So, you've never worked on a case with someone else before?

829
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,610
No, I never needed to since I'm good at my job.

830
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,340
You probably won't need to do that again even into your ninth year.

831
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,840
You're so insistent on saying nine years.

832
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,490
You could've just rounded up to ten.

833
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,840
Because it's been nine years.

834
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:16,750
You performed this song, right?

835
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,050
You remember that?

836
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,060
Shouldn't we have left earlier?

837
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,080
But that dim sum place was a must.

838
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,020
Who knew traffic would be this bad?

839
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,360
But it was good, though. Right?

840
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,800
Yeah, it was pretty good.

841
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,350
But let's hurry.

842
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,110
People would think I'm the one going to work.

843
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,870
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay. Let's go.

844
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,690
Get on my back.

845
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,080
I'm fine.

846
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,800
You said you were covering for a friend's shift.

847
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,390
Come on.

848
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,990
Hold on tight.

849
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,350
Oh, right.

850
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,350
Thank you. I'll head in first.

851
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:29,090
- Okay. Hurry on inside.
- Okay.

852
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,800
When did you start playing piano?

853
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,140
Since I was eight.

854
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,900
Was it always your dream to be a pianist?

855
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,350
Yeah, I think so.

856
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:12,010
My parents loved watching me play the piano.

857
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:15,370
I loved seeing my parents smile while watching me.

858
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:21,110
So, you played the piano because you liked seeing them smile?

859
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,850
That's right.

860
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,370
I think that's why I keep playing.

861
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:30,780
Honestly, I never dreamed of becoming a world-class pianist or anything.

862
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,160
What about you, Ju Hyeong?

863
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,330
Did you always want to be an attorney?

864
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,990
At first, I had a different dream.

865
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:40,270
But I changed my mind as I got older.

866
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:44,100
Why? What made you want to become an attorney?

867
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:48,000
Growing up, I was good at two things.

868
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,960
Arguing and studying.

869
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,970
So, becoming an attorney felt like the natural path.

870
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,420
And?

871
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,000
Do you think you'll become a good attorney?

872
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,460
Yes.

873
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,680
That's my dream.

874
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:09,970
Wait, is your ankle okay?

875
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,800
Yes, it's gotten much better.

876
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:16,660
Would you sit down for a minute?

877
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:38,250
Put your foot up here.

878
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,940
It's really fine...

879
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:01,490
Don't you use your right foot to press the pedal?

880
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,840
- That's right.
- You pushed through it.

881
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,690
I don't notice it while playing.

882
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,500
What a professional.

883
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,240
When did you buy this?

884
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,360
I ran out quickly as soon as you started playing.

885
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,520
You're good to go now.

886
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,960
By the way, this place is really pretty.

887
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,990
Yes, really pretty.

888
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,710
When we're back in Seoul,

889
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:17,660
would you like to go with me if there's another place like this?

890
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,410
Where?

891
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,750
Gangnam Station...

892
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,340
Gangnam Station.

893
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,100
Sounds good.

894
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,290
Sounds good.

895
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,820
Sounds good...

896
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,100
So, how did you end up becoming an attorney?

897
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,520
I thought you'd stick with piano.

898
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,880
You don't have to tell me.

899
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,340
No, it's okay.

900
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:06,940
My dad had a business back then as well.

901
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:09,670
Thanks to that, I could study without worry.

902
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,550
But then he got scammed big time.

903
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,710
It was some crypto pyramid scheme.

904
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:20,880
After that, our family became a mess.

905
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,040
At some point, no one was smiling anymore.

906
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,960
But I couldn't do anything about it.

907
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:31,330
So, I made up my mind

908
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:36,850
that if anything bad were to happen to my parents again,

909
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:39,670
I will protect them myself.

910
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:44,440
It must have been very difficult, but it was overcome.

911
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,850
You're right.

912
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,900
My dad is a really strong person.

913
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,970
No, I'm talking about you, Kang Hui Ji.

914
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,760
Me?

915
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:56,840
Not everyone comes out of that thinking like you do.

916
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,650
You overcame it well.

917
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,430
You did well.

918
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,180
You're right.

919
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,580
I did pretty well.

920
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:13,120
Everything's okay now.

921
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,960
I just want my parents to stay happy.

922
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,740
That's my dream.

923
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:23,780
Your dream hasn't changed in 10 years.

924
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:26,870
Did I say this 10 years ago, too?

925
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,580
You really don't remember anything.

926
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,450
I mean, I remember your dream.

927
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:33,140
It was to become a good attorney.

928
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,470
You've accomplished your dream.

929
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:44,350
I can't say I became a good attorney.

930
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,610
Why not? You're a good attorney.

931
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:49,210
You listen to people in need

932
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,810
and help them fight back.

933
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,240
Honestly, I don't think of it as helping them.

934
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,670
Based on what I can see,

935
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,840
I just get paid to fight on their behalf.

936
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,140
If being a good attorney means going beyond that,

937
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,970
then I'm not.

938
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:16,350
Still,

939
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:22,050
you're a good attorney senior to me.

940
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:26,170
And a good person.

941
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,390
Thank you.

942
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,820
Don't you usually take the subway to work only

943
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,820
and take the bus home?

944
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,850
Yes, since the subway runs on time.

945
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:55,220
And the bus goes straight to my house.

946
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:58,750
This way leads to the subway. The bus is that way.

947
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,480
I know.

948
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:28,280
You're heading back tomorrow, right?

949
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,910
Yes.

950
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,940
Shall we head inside?

951
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

952
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,170
♫  In a sea of unfamiliar lights  ♫

953
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:24,100
♫  You stood out, shining so brightly  ♫

954
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,100
♫  What began as coincidence  ♫

955
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:39,400
♫  I hope we are meant to be wrapped in fate  ♫

956
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:49,300
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

957
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:55,700
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

958
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:05,390
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

959
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:14,440
♫  That it was nice to meet you, and I liked you  ♫

960
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:23,250
♫  You and I from back then, if we ever meet again  ♫

961
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:29,430
♫  I want to say to you  ♫

962
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:37,710
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

963
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:44,120
♫  Even if we don't love  ♫

964
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:53,780
♫  I want to tell you from back then  ♫

965
01:18:53,780 --> 01:19:02,150
♫  That it was nice to meet you, and I liked you  ♫

966
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:13,020
♫  Can I love you even as you disappear?  ♫

967
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:21,030
♫  Though you may not want to hear this  ♫

968
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:29,250
♫  These are the words I've kept in my heart  ♫

♫  That's not why I cried  ♫|

971
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:59,740
♫  It's just that everything felt so unfamiliar  ♫

972
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:05,500
♫  At the end of time that arrived before we knew it  ♫

973
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,340
The girl you met on your trip while in law school—

974
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,480
What? You two were like that?

975
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,510
Ever since Hong Kong, Ju Hyeong and Attorney Kang—

976
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:18,910
Hey, Mun Jeong is looking for you.

977
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,760
If you're drunk, hurry up and go home.

978
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,730
A voice phishing case?

979
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,460
They said they'd make a special exception to get me a loan.

980
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,100
This would normally be an easy case to defend...

981
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,980
Where do you get this?

982
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,780
This must be really hard for you.

983
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:34,020
So, do your families all ask why you're not getting married?

984
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,570
Gosh, that scared me!

985
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:37,430
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

986
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:40,260
- Yes.
- When was your favorite moment?

987
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,350
Right now?

988
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,410
♫  Let's greet each other with a smile  ♫

989
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:52,680
♫  Hi, today is a good day for me  ♫
