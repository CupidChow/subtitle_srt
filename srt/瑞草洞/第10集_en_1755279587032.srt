1
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,550
Well, is there an issue?

2
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,490
I'm in charge of Mr. Mun Chan Yeong's case right now.

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,140
Yes.

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,540
Telling me to defend a school violence perpetrator

5
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,990
is too much, isn't it?

6
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,400
Who said you could pick and choose a case?

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
- I know I'm an associate attorney—
- No, no.

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,050
Regardless of that,

9
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,370
an attorney shouldn't be picky with a case.

10
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,620
Isn't a perpetrator not supposed to be defended?

11
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,360
They are. They are, but...

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,550
I'm defending a school violence victim now.

13
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,210
I hope you don't make me do both, at least.

14
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,280
Attorney Jo,

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,870
do you defend with your heart?

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,380
I think you're seriously mistaken.

17
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,250
An attorney translates what the client wants to say in legal language.

18
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,350
There's nothing else.

19
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,320
We're just technicians.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
You got a case that contradicts the other?

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,020
Why does it matter?

22
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,320
­

23

Timing and Subtitles brought to you
by Cracks in the System @ Viki.com

24
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,400
Let's do well today.

25
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,920
Okay.

26
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,560
Since this might be my last case.

27
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,400
I read your written statement, Attorney.

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
- Mr. Mun Chan Yeong.
- Yes.

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,880
You admit the charge, right?

30
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,070
Yes.

31
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,460
He means he admits that he did the stabbing.

32
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,200
It doesn't mean he's pleading guilty.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,080
Yes, I know.

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,870
You wrote a long and detailed statement.

35
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,280
I understand what you mean.

36
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,190
What happened to the victim?

37
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,700
The one who got stabbed? Kim Jeong Min?

38
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,210
- Yes.
- He's fine.

39
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,850
He wasn't stabbed in a vital spot.

40
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,800
By the way, you know it's hard to...

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,940
prove self-defense, right?

42
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,650
The problem right now is that

43
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,790
it was more of an attack than a defense.

44
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,480
Active counterattacks have been ruled self-defense before.

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
Since the abuse has persisted for a long time,

46
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,900
the moment Mr. Kim approached with a knife

47
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,920
can't be the only time Chan Yeong was attacked.

48
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,110
We discussed a lot internally, too.

49
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,490
We decided to detain him for now.

50
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,460
It can't be avoided because...

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,210
it was an attempted murder case.

52
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,340
Mr. Kim had stopped attacking at the time, too.

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,860
That's not true.

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,430
He didn't stop attacking.

55
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,390
What if he picked up the knife first?

56
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,300
What if he took the knife after Chan Yeong picked it up?

57
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,630
He's been bullying him for two years.

58
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,230
This isn't just kids' play.

59
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,350
As a father of a child,

60
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,520
I wish I didn't have to.

61
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,190
I'll send your statement to the prosecution for now.

62
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,760
Please give it some time.

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,200
You never know. The prosecution might drop the case.

64
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,120
Excuse me, where's Mun Jeong...

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Where's Bae Mun Jeong located?

66
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,740
Just one moment.

67
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,380
Go to the Yellow Zone, No. 2.

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,660
Mun Jeong, a-are you okay?

69
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,320
There are other patients. Be quiet.

70
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,470
W-What did they say? Did they say you're okay?

71
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,140
I don't know.

72
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,380
Ms. Bae Mun Jeong.

73
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,570
Your guardian is here.

74
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,950
- How's the baby?
- How's she?

75
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,600
Let me have a look first.

76
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,130
The uterus expands in the second trimester.

77
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,390
Your stomach could feel stiff.

78
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,630
Relax all the muscles and fully rest when that happens.

79
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,720
Let me have a look at your stomach.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,380
If it hardens for over 20 minutes or hardens regularly,

81
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,100
the uterus might contract.

82
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,960
Come to the hospital immediately, then.

83
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,930
And don't be out alone.

84
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,620
Always accompany your guardian.

85
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,590
Please give me the gel.

86
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,490
Let me have a look.

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,050
The baby is well.

88
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,390
Gosh, how loud.

89
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,630
Don't worry.

90
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,800
You can go home when you finish the relaxant medication.

91
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,960
- Thank you.
- Sure.

92
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,550
Don't cry. He said you're okay.

93
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,590
I'm not crying.

94
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,640
Paying the corporate tax based on the revenue

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,740
doesn't seem right to me.

96
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,010
The floors that didn't make a profit will also pay together.

97
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,960
That's not right.

98
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,890
I agree with Ms. Kang.

99
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,910
Our individual calculation and

100
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,260
the net gain after the taxes

101
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,850
are not matching.

102
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,980
That's the issue.

103
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,120
Let's just use the revenue.

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,010
It'll be too hard to calculate the costs for each floor.

105
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,940
It's hard, but calculating properly

106
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,210
would be better in the long run.

107
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,600
How long a run exactly?

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,980
Are we in deficit this year? Are you trying to avoid corporate tax?

109
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,500
How could you say that?

110
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,020
Let's try not to go too far. Seriously.

111
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,710
You say that because using the revenue

112
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,610
is advantageous to you this year.

113
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,000
Is that so bad?

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,360
You're doing this to make it advantageous to you, too.

115
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,690
I'm suggesting doing this properly.

116
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,900
Anyway, we don't have bookkeepers.

117
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,660
It's a headache to talk about expenses. Figure it out.

118
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,930
Stop being so irresponsible.

119
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,180
We won't figure things out like this.

120
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,120
Let's reset the standard.

121
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,780
What have we been talking about, then?

122
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,820
Yes.

123
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,470
Please have a look at these, too.

124
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,610
We suddenly received five lawsuits.

125
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,100
Okay, got it.

126
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,610
There's too much to do, right? I'll ask them to give you a bonus.

127
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,400
Gosh, it's okay.

128
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,110
Is there something going on?

129
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,400
No, there isn't.

130
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,630
Okay.

131
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,690
Let's cheer up.

132
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,370
Okay.

133
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,880
Defense, please respond to the request for clarification.

134
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,990
The next trial will be on May 15, 2025

135
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,580
at 2:10 p.m. in this courtroom.

136
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,910
Let's move on to the next case.

137
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:49,480
Case number 2025-Gadan-2736.

138
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,490
Who's present?

139
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,690
I'm Attorney Kang Jeong Yun of Law Group Hyungmin.

140
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,630
I'm Attorney Seong Yu Deok of Law Group Hyungmin.

141
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,040
Pardon?

142
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,320
Have a seat first.

143
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,570
What's this?

144
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,280
Did you make an error in the Notice of Appearance?

145
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,870
Are you the plaintiff's attorney?

146
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,650
- Yes.
- And you're the defense's attorney?

147
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,800
Yes, correct.

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,100
Your firm represents both parties. Did you not know?

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
No.

150
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,820
Let's postpone this trial for now.

151
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,920
Sort this out, please.

152
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,800
- Got it.
- Got it.

153
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,630
Let's start the next trial.

154
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,370
You should step down.

155
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,690
You should step down.

156
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,290
I'm representing the plaintiff.

157
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,870
The trial starts when the complaint is submitted.

158
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,910
The defendant hires the attorney after receiving the complaint.

159
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,090
That means we came first.

160
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,180
Since the plaintiff threatened to sue so much,

161
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,960
the defendant hired me even before the complaint arrived.

162
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
When were you hired?

163
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,770
- Last winter.
- I was hired last fall.

164
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,590
It was in late fall. Winter started early.

165
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,750
How do you know your client?

166
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,780
I know mine personally. You need to step down.

167
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,400
It must be easier to talk to them since you know them personally.

168
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,050
How much fee are you being paid?

169
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,960
Whoever is getting paid less should step down.

170
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,390
That's nonsense.

171
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,860
Your price must be very low.

172
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,810
You folded as soon as I brought it up.

173
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,480
If I step down, will you split your fee with me?

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,610
- No, why?
- That's what I'm saying.

175
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,370
The fee has nothing to do with it.

176
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,980
Step down since you were hired later.

177
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,120
I can't.

178
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,360
I didn't hit him.

179
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,590
I was just goofing around.

180
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,100
Men can tussle a bit.

181
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,640
What do you think, sir?

182
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,920
My son says... he did nothing wrong.

183
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,460
Do you want to plead not guilty, then?

184
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,680
Yes. Dad, didn't you tell him?

185
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,100
Well, Attorney.

186
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,770
For this... can you get him a not guilty ruling?

187
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,100
I can't say he's not guilty.

188
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,800
But you have to, Attorney.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,110
I'll pay you a handsome fee.

190
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,900
Drink up, son. It's okay.

191
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,520
It was a prank, right?

192
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,770
Please wait a moment.

193
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,790
I wonder if Mun Jeong is okay.

194
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,150
I talked to her on my way out. She's okay now.

195
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,150
I hope she gets to rest for a few days.

196
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,090
She has tons of trials, right?

197
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,070
I can take a few of hers.

198
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,400
Let me know if you need help.

199
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,190
I need to return her favor, too.

200
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,930
Yes, ask me for help, too.

201
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,530
It's okay. I can handle it.

202
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,790
- Did you get a perm?
- Doesn't it look nice?

203
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,690
Yes.

204
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:31,450
Right. Did you hear my managing partner and yours ran into each other in a trial?

205
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,470
No, I didn't.

206
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,620
They're the plaintiff and defendant's attorneys in the same case.

207
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,490
- What? Representing both parties?
- Yes.

208
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,670
He takes on any cases.

209
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,420
Who's stepping down, then?

210
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,800
My managing partner won't back down.

211
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,580
Mine isn't so easy, either.

212
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,450
But the clients heard about it

213
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,130
and decided not to hire them, saying they couldn't trust them.

214
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,420
Neither of them is on the case.

215
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,860
Gosh, good going.

216
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,240
I mean, my managing partner. Not yours.

217
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,820
- Bye.
- See you.

218
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,090
Take care.

219
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,370
What is it? What's wrong?

220
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,350
It's nothing.

221
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,260
Is the school violence case not going well?

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,240
It's not that.

223
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,220
I got another school violence case.

224
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,830
This time, I'm representing the attacker.

225
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,240
Gosh, he's still the same.

226
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,040
Mr. Seong has always been like that.

227
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,900
Just try not to be emotionally involved.

228
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,710
You left because you couldn't stand it.

229
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,250
You know, I left for more money.

230
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,610
So, are you happy now that you're making a lot of money?

231
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,120
Gosh, I'm going to be happy.

232
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,710
You stayed up all night because of me.

233
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,840
Why did you come in so soon? I told you to rest more.

234
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,000
It's okay. I'm fine.

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,140
Just admit it if you're tired.

236
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,350
Don't just say you're okay.

237
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,550
I'm okay, I said.

238
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,080
Should I get you coffee?

239
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,070
You said decaf is fine.

240
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,800
You learn a lot from your girlfriend.

241
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,610
I'll buy you coffee later.

242
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,020
- Manager.
- Yes.

243
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,840
- Please submit this.
- Okay.

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,540
Well, this is... the thing is...

245
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,790
I'm not posting this now.

246
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,790
I was just preparing...

247
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,810
I was just saving it as a draft.

248
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,530
Hey, you came in.

249
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,610
Are you okay?

250
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,600
Mr. Na, are you posting a job opening?

251
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,730
Oh, that?

252
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,040
I told her to prepare it just in case.

253
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,020
I wanted to get some resumes.

254
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,670
Are you filling my position?

255
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm not hiring now.

256
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,950
I don't know what will happen with you yet.

257
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,420
I know. You don't know. Why do this already?

258
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,730
Are you telling me to leave?

259
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,360
No.

260
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,590
Don't think that way. I'm just...

261
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,070
worried, that's why.

262
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,790
I still have no issue working.

263
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,900
I'll let you know if there's an issue.

264
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,990
You don't have to worry until then.

265
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,790
You came back.

266
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,350
Yes.

267
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,250
Attorney, is what's written here...

268
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,740
Is it correct?

269
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,200
Yes, it's correct.

270
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,570
You're pleading not guilty?

271
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,880
Yes.

272
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,140
There's plenty of evidence for this.

273
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,220
If you deny assault...

274
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,120
That's a bit...

275
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:19,020
If you look at the photos, it looks like an assault.

276
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:26,080
But... it happened while they were goofing around.

277
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,290
They were goofing around?

278
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,010
Yes. He apparently bruises easily, too.

279
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,460
Attorney Jo.

280
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,300
- Yes.
- Mr. Mun Chan Yeong's case

281
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,730
ruling arrived. I put it on your desk.

282
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,400
Okay, thank you.

283
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,240
Shit.

284
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,200
Attorney Jo.

285
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,240
Yes.

286
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,140
Am I going to jail now, then?

287
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,720
Well, being prosecuted means you'll have a trial.

288
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,120
It doesn't mean you're guilty.

289
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,430
Will you keep... insisting it was self-defense?

290
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,030
I'm contemplating what would be better for you.

291
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,880
What would you like to do?

292
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:20,820
I... think I did the wrong thing.

293
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,010
But...

294
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,140
it's still too unfair.

295
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,710
Attorney Jo, I'm so scared.

296
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,500
I don't want to go to jail.

297
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,010
You said there's a disagreement regarding the corporate tax.

298
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,610
So, I created a summary.

299
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,790
First of all, we'll be paying based on

300
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,840
each floor's net gain.

301
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,900
Using the revenue makes it cleaner.

302
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,110
Golfing or client management cost

303
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,930
has to mention who it was for and what was involved.

304
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,090
I didn't include the ones without proof.

305
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,460
I'm on board.

306
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,010
If you look at the last page,

307
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,020
it lists the corporate tax amount for each floor.

308
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,840
Have a look and if there are no issues,

309
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,510
we'll proceed this way.

310
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,950
Well, okay...

311
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,580
This is good. Let's go with this.

312
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,890
I approve, too.

313
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,920
Yes, let's.

314
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,330
But can we do this next year, too?

315
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,850
I lost a case for no reason, too.

316
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,160
I can say the same, too.

317
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,120
Let me tell you this in advance.

318
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,830
If the same situation happens again,

319
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm not willing to yield.

320
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,180
I didn't think a merger would only bring good things,

321
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,730
but it's tiring in many ways.

322
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,130
You decided on this merger yourselves.

323
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,610
As you know, our revenue increased greatly, too.

324
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm aware of the inconvenience the merger caused.

325
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,690
Feel free to ask me for help anytime.

326
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,570
Okay.

327
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,130
I wanted to get some resumes.

328
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,190
I don't know what will happen with you yet.

329
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,920
Mun Jeong!

330
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,230
It's been so long.

331
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,960
Hey, how long has it been?

332
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,490
I know.

333
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,960
Why do you look so great?

334
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,380
Do I?

335
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,070
I'm not doing so well lately.

336
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,600
Hey, what are you saying?

337
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,420
You look much better than when you worked in-house.

338
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,810
You always looked mopey back then

339
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,420
and you had a dead look in your eyes.

340
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,100
I admit it.

341
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,700
Trials must be your thing.

342
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
You look much happier.

343
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,520
You know, I'm just another working mom.

344
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,710
Are you much happier than when you did trials?

345
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,550
What's the legal team like here?

346
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,580
You know what it's like.

347
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,840
It's totally different than the Seocho area.

348
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,370
At least, you can...

349
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,180
commute with your child here.

350
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,910
That's nice.

351
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,220
- He goes to the company child care, right?
- Yes.

352
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,380
When did you start sending him there?

353
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,040
Did you get back to work right after giving birth?

354
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,680
Are you pregnant?

355
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,270
Yes.

356
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,330
Congratulations. That's great.

357
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,010
Thank you.

358
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,970
You must have a lot on your mind.

359
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,960
Right?

360
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,330
How do you request maternity leave at your company?

361
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,050
Defense, do you still insist on self-defense?

362
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,880
Yes, that's correct.

363
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,300
After the evidence examination,

364
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,590
will you question the defendant?

365
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,730
Yes, I will.

366
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,800
What grade are you in right now?

367
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,860
I'm in 12th grade.

368
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,000
It's unusual to transfer in 12th grade.

369
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,600
How did you end up doing that?

370
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,550
For over a year,

371
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,510
I was bullied at school.

372
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,510
You transferred because you couldn't continue attending school, right?

373
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,170
Yes.

374
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,810
What's the name of the bully?

375
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,230
It's Kim Jeong Min.

376
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,670
When he came to you at your new school,

377
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,280
how did you feel?

378
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,700
I thought, "This won't end.

379
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,290
Even when I reported him,

380
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,890
he was punished,

381
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,250
was expelled, and I even transferred schools,

382
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,880
it will never end."

383
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,990
When Mr. Kim came to see you

384
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,750
and charged you with a knife,

385
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,250
you fought back for the first time, and the knife fell. Right?

386
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,800
Yes, that's correct.

387
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,830
You said you knew you had to pick up the knife first, as you picked it up.

388
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,040
What were you thinking when you picked it up?

389
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,720
"I want to live.

390
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,110
I don't want to die."

391
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,250
What if...

392
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,940
the one who picked up the knife first

393
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,990
was Kim Jeong Min instead of you, what would've happened?

394
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,380
I wouldn't be here now.

395
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,990
That's all.

396
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,230
Prosecutor, do you wish to cross-examine?

397
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,050
I don't.

398
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,130
Defendant, go back to your seat.

399
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,680
Prosecutor, please request the sentence.

400
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,980
I ask that the sentence be one year and three months,

401
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,460
with two years of probation.

402
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,090
You seek probation?

403
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,260
Yes, considering overall circumstances,

404
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,370
I seek probation.

405
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,780
Okay, got it.

406
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,700
Hello.

407
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,620
Okay.

408
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,850
Attorney An, there will be a consultation later.

409
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,190
Okay, got it.

410
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,500
- What I just said was changed to tomorrow.
- Okay.

411
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,500
I recently got a Family Relationship Certificate,

412
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,300
and it turns out my father passed.

413
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,220
Oh, did you not know?

414
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,180
No. Since he got divorced 20 years ago,

415
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,960
we haven't talked at all.

416
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,150
Because I felt kind of bad,

417
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,620
I asked our relatives to find out.

418
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,690
He passed away less than a month ago.

419
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,200
Oh, and...

420
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,200
Haven't you heard from your father?

421
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,720
No.

422
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,100
We haven't talked since the divorce.

423
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,300
We haven't heard about him for over 20 years.

424
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,640
You must not know he got remarried, then.

425
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,810
Hyeon Wu.

426
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,180
Say hello.

427
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,530
Hello.

428
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Hi.

429
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,860
It felt kind of strange.

430
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,500
He got divorced when we were that age.

431
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,940
The woman he remarried passed away last year due to illness.

432
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,280
And Father passed away from cancer recently.

433
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,590
Will we receive an inheritance in a situation like this?

434
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,410
Yes, you're inheritors even though he lived separately after the divorce.

435
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,080
Right now, there are three inheritors, including you and the boy.

436
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,140
I see.

437
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,170
We should prepare for it, then.

438
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,650
It turns out he had more debt than assets.

439
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,870
Do we just renounce the inheritance in this situation?

440
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,100
He passed away less than a month ago.

441
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,620
You can renounce it.

442
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,890
You can, but...

443
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,460
No, renouncing the inheritance is the cleanest way.

444
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,260
Help us to do that, then.

445
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,590
Okay, got it.

446
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,630
Isn't it over once they renounce the inheritance?

447
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,410
Yes, but I'm worried about that boy.

448
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,610
If my clients renounce the inheritance,

449
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,880
all of the debt will go to that child.

450
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,090
Can he not renounce the inheritance?

451
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,770
No. The siblings are inheritors when the children renounce.

452
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,470
But one of them is the boy's guardian.

453
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,230
They'll have to renounce on his behalf.

454
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,660
But they won't since they'll inherit the debt, then.

455
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,240
You also want to help the boy renounce, right?

456
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,830
Yes.

457
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,380
It won't be easy to get everyone's approval.

458
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,000
Gosh. I renounced inheritance when my father passed, too.

459
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,390
Visiting one person at a time isn't easy.

460
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,010
You receive the ruling today, right?

461
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,340
Yes. At 2:00.

462
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,530
How do you think it'll go?

463
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,880
I'm not sure.

464
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,230
Deputy, did Chan Yeong go to court for the ruling?

465
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,500
Yes. The paralegal went with him.

466
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,830
Did his grandmother go, too?

467
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,800
No, Chan Yeong went alone.

468
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,670
Is that so?

469
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,960
You're Mr. Mun Chan Yeong's attorney, correct?

470
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,320
Yes, that's correct.

471
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,650
Come forward together.

472
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,960
Defendant Mun Chan Yeong.

473
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,370
Yes.

474
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,540
Before I announce the ruling,

475
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,160
I want to say this was a difficult case for us, too.

476
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,420
We believed you were a victim of school violence

477
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,630
and Mr. Kim continued to abuse you, too.

478
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,650
We acknowledge the current and immediate threat,

479
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,270
one of the requirements for self-defense.

480
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,050
However, it's difficult to say the stabbing of

481
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,360
Mr. Kim Jeong Min was socially acceptable as

482
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,250
a mode of self-defense.

483
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,660
Therefore, we cannot acknowledge it as self-defense.

484
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,050
But even the prosecution is seeking probation and

485
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,890
everyone is hoping for a lesser sentence due to mitigating circumstances.

486
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,750
Therefore, I announce the following ruling.

487
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,650
Defendant Mun Chan Yeong will be sentenced to one year and three months.

488
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:09,210
However, he will be on probation starting this date for two years.

489
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,230
You went through so much.

490
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,220
Thank you. Thank you.

It's on me.

497
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,540

You're so impressive.

501
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,540
Good work, Jo Chang Won.

502
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,830
No, I admire the prosecutor.

503
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,170
He was my client,

504
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,030
but it's not easy for a prosecutor to do that.

505
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,090
What would you be if you weren't an attorney?

506
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,660
- Why do you suddenly ask that?
- Well...

507
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,900
I was a bit surprised, to be honest.

508
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,460
What prosecutor seeks probation for attempted murder?

509
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,650
You're right.

510
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,400
I think it rarely happens in any case.

511
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,160
I know. The judge seemed surprised, too.

512
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,520
So, it got me thinking...

513
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,840
if I could've done that if I were a prosecutor.

514
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,290
I asked if you wanted to become something.

515
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,100
Well...

516
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,360
I did, but I won't pursue it.

517
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,830
What was it?

518
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,760
Why should I tell you when I won't pursue it?

519
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,690
Geez. What is it? Tell me.

520
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,990
I don't want to.

521
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,470
- You don't want to?
- No.

522
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,110
Tell my mom, then.

523
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,780

Is there a reason you became an attorney?

528
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,300
You just ended up there while studying.

529
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,260
An attorney translates what the client wants to say in legal language.

530
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,500
There's nothing else. We're just technicians.

531
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,610
You seek a probation?

532
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,800
Yes, considering overall circumstances,

533
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,790
I seek a probation.

534
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,610
♫  I start a new day like this  ♫

535

It's Shin Ji Hye.

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,860
Yes, how can I help you?

538
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,200
My husband died.

539
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,810
What happened?

540
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,480
He killed himself.

541
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,390
He was an insurance salesman.

542
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,770
Hyung, it's me, Tae Hyeon.

543
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,920
H-Have you been well?

544
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,910
Yes, yes.

545
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,700
He worked for an agency called Deus GA.

546
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,890
They demanded a high quota.

547
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,370
Do you have cancer insurance, by chance?

548
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,750
If you can't meet the quota of the day,

549
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,280
the entire team wasn't allowed to go home.

550
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,830
When things went nowhere,

551
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,740
you had to sign up under your name to go home.

552
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,400
Geez, I can finally go home.

553
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,920
You should've done it sooner.

554
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,310
Geez.

555
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,580
Thanks for letting us go home.

556
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,500
- Let's go home.
- Thank you.

557
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
I'm so tired.

558
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,320
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

559
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,600
Cheer up tomorrow, too.

560
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,820
Geez. Seriously.

561
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,030
Honey.

562
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,720
Honey.

563
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,160
- Huh?
- Here.

564
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,470
- Yes.
- You left your phone.

565
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,010
I could see him gradually getting weary.

566
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,950
Let's do a good job today, too.

567
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,540
Seriously.

568
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,140
What's he always doing, sitting there?

569
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,980
Shouldn't he feel sorry if he's bad?

570
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,210
Why does he drag others down?

571
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,510
He's incompetent and irresponsible.

572
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,270
- He's really something.
- Hopeless.

573
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,500
But I didn't know he was struggling that much.

574
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,230
I thought...

575
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,660
stuff like this only happened to others.

576
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,540
You're suing the agency, right?

577
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,370
I already submitted the complaint.

578
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,570
But it's difficult to do it alone.

579
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,430
Yes.

580
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,200
Excuse me. Attorney An, just one second.

581
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,450
Wrap it up soon. Don't take the case.

582
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,930
- Why not?
- Things didn't go as planned.

583
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,490
I should've told her not to come.

584
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,950
I guess she didn't get the message.

585
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,230
Make an excuse to get out of it

586
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,600
and consult the next person. You'll know why in the meeting.

587
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,010
Hello, this is Attorney Kang Hui Ji.

588
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:02,460
The thing is,

589
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,960
you said you visited the boy once.

590
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,840
Could you tell me where he lives?

591
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,930
I thought it'd be good if the boy renounced the inheritance, too.

592
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,930
We can manage that ourselves.

593
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,120
You're Jin Yeong and Jin Ah's attorney.

594
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,550
Just worry about them. What's the issue?

595
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,900
My clients will renounce the inheritance.

596
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,710
That makes Hyeon Wu the only inheritor.

597
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,810
All of the late Mr. Kim's debt will go to Hyeon Wu.

598
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,780
If you agree, I'll help him renounce his inheritance, too.

599
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,210
What about us, then?

600
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,990
If he renounces, we'll get all of it.

601
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,440
Do you think I didn't know?

602
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,440
It's not like you'd help us, too.

603
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,280
What if I helped all of you?

604
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,110
Then...

605
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,150
let's do that.

606
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,340
You're from Deus GA?

607
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,040
Yes, hello. I'm the branch manager.

608
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,670
This is the CEO.

609
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,710
Hello.

610
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,390
Our company isn't forceful like that.

611
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,960
You'll see if you see the confirmation of facts.

612
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,210
All of our salespeople testified

613
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,330
that we didn't pressure them like that.

614
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,640
I feel sorry for Ms. Shin,

615
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,430
but asking us to compensate is too much.

616
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,830
You met Ms. Shin Ji Hye earlier, right?

617
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,000
- Yes.
- She keeps running wild, threatening to sue us.

618
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,540
We have no choice but to prepare in advance, right?

619
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,480
Manager, running wild?

620
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,410
She's having a hard time. Don't say that about her.

621
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,490
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

622
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,860
Mr. Na, what's going on?

623
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,300
- What do you mean?
- How did they know to come here?

624
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,410
I wouldn't know.

625
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,070
Are you saying you'll take this case?

626
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,300
They offered a much higher fee. What can I do?

627
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,200
We can't represent both.

628
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,100
This could become an issue.

629
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,150
We never agreed to represent Ms. Shin.

630
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,640
We didn't break the Attorneys-at-Law Act.

631
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,560
What's the issue?

632
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,830
She came to us first, and I was just talking to her.

633
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:04,310
You can't reject a client just because of the fee.

634
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,730
What is it? You don't want the case?

635
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,030
I'll give it to Attorney Bae, then.

636
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,210
No, I'll do it.

637
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,700
When we submit Kim Jin Yeong and Kim Jin Ah's renunciation of inheritance,

638
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,930
how about we submit for their half-brother and relatives, too?

639
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,690
But they aren't our clients.

640
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,550
They aren't,

641
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,250
but we just need to add their names.

642
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,280
It's not difficult or more work.

643
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,810
The workload isn't the issue.

644
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,640
You can find a way to make it work.

645
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,300
But we don't do volunteer work.

646
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,900
We can't just do that for them.

647
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,620
If only the clients renounce the inheritance,

648
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,920
the boy will end up with the debt.

649
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,910
I can see why you're concerned.

650
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,860
But you can't help people every time you're concerned.

651
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,950
I'll try to persuade them again.

652
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,190
Can we just add the boy, at least?

653
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,040
I love this side of you,

654
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,730
but my position is a bit different.

655
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,250
I understand you're concerned,

656
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:28,030
but let's be a bit detached from our work.

657
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,420
I understood, but I was surprised.

658
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,150
I thought my managing partner was similar to me.

659
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,830
That's what a managing partner should do.

660
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,410
It's easier to think that way.

661
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,580
You should be on my side in a situation like this.

662
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,160
Well,

663
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,180
you said you understood her, too.

664
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,140
I was just saying that out of duty

665
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,960
but you should do your duty as a boyfriend.

666
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,150
Repeat after me.

667
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,580
"She went too far. It's not a hard thing to do."

668
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,210
Say it.

669
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,020
She went too far. It's not a hard thing to do.

670
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,880
Good job.

671
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,870
You have a point, too. She has her reasons.

672
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,420
But he's just a child.

673
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,340
I should seek another way if adding a client is an issue.

674
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,920
It's your turn now.

675
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,310
- What do you mean?
- You have a concern. I can tell.

676
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,050
The managing partner made me refuse a client

677
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,700
and represent her opponent.

678
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,930
Finding a solution would be difficult for me.

679
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:07,500
What do you mean by that? Did I understand correctly?

680
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,540
A client came,

681
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,520
but you turned her down to represent her opponent?

682
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,400
Why? Because of the fee?

683
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,060
Yes, probably.

684
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,320
That's too much.

685
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,700
It's okay. An attorney with 10 years of experience

686
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,480
should be okay with this.

687
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,140
I'm okay.

688
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,770
You no longer say nine years.

689
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,710
Your managing partner was wrong.

690
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,560
Try this, too. It's good.

691
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,920
I work at Deus GA's Gangro branch

692
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,060
and I've worked with the late Kim Tae Hyeon.

693
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,720
The company was accused of

694
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,430
pressuring a certain quota after Mr. Kim's passing.

695
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,460
But there's a misunderstanding.

696
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,910
That's why I'd like to tell you the truth.

697
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,810
Our company is like a family.

698
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,380
We weren't forced to meet a quota.

699
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,960
My team encourages and helps each other for success.

700
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,390
We don't pressure each other to meet personal quota

701
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,580
get in each other's business.

702
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,660
Saying we weren't allowed to go home if we didn't meet the quota

703
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,630
is almost delusional.

704
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,210
We get to decide when we go home based on the workload

705
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,050
Geez, you dummy.

706
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,930
Mr. Kim always struggled to adjust to the atmosphere.

707
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,780
What he struggled with was his own lack of ability...

708
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,580
The company didn't reprimand or pressure him for it.

709
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,700
I remember they actually tried to help him.

710
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,450
My signature below approves this as a fact.

711
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,850
Kim Jun Hyeok.

712
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,260
Gosh. Attorney An.

713
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,520
What brings you here without calling?

714
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,900
Hello.

715
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,520
Could I meet with the people who wrote

716
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,780
the confirmation of facts, by chance?

717
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,070
Why?

718
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,790
I'd like to know what it was actually like.

719
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,890
Oh, I see. Okay.

720
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,600
But everyone's busy.

721
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,060
I'm sure only one or two are here.

722
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,190
Okay. That's fine.

723
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,590
It's all true.

724
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:35,380
You said Mr. Kim always struggled to adjust.

725
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,940
In what way, exactly?

726
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,490
He always looked tired when he came in.

727
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,440
He couldn't even say hello to people properly.

728
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,350
From the beginning or after a while?

729
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,020
Well, I'm not so sure.

730
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,790
But he was definitely like that recently.

731
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,640
I wondered if he was getting depressed again.

732
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,920
What? Depressed again?

733
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,660
You mean, he has been depressed?

734
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,860
Yes. Briefly, when he was young, apparently.

735
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,390
Then, he was already mentally ill.

736
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,720
How did you know that?

737
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,080
Well, we were close at first.

738
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,050
He told me when we talked about our past over drinks.

739
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,820
He said he struggled a bit in his youth.

740
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:20,660
He didn't always struggle to get along with people, then.

741
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,820
I-Is that so?

742
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,350
I guess that's true.

743
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,920
Attorney An, why is that important?

744
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,670
The point is that it's not our fault, right?

745
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,180
Yes.

746
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,550
Let's move on to the next case.

747
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:09,090
Case Number 2025-Gadan-37845.

748
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,730
Plaintiff, Shin Ji Hye. Defendant, Deus GA, Inc.

749
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,170
Who's present?

750
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,460
Plaintiff, Shin Ji Hye, and Attorney Kim Se Yeon are present.

751
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,730
Defense Attorney An Ju Hyeong of

752
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,560
Law Group Hyungmin is present.

753
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,130
Okay. Have a seat.

754
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,810
The defendant's company was run in an abusive way

755
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:54,100
in which they didn't allow the entire team to go home

756
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,410
if a member couldn't meet the quota.

757
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,080
The plaintiff's husband became depressed due to the stress

758
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,360
and he ended up committing suicide.

759
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,870
The defendant's company owes the plaintiff compensation.

760
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,290
Got it.

761
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,080
First of all, the National Health Insurance Service

762
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,760
submitted documents in response to our order.

763
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,150
The defense attorney saw it, correct?

764
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,520
Yes, I saw it.

765
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,360
State your opinion, then.

766
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:25,150
According to the documents submitted by the National Health Insurance Service,

767
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,090
the plaintiff's husband, the late Kim Tae Hyeon,

768
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:31,110
was diagnosed with depression in his 20s.

769
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,630
In order to demand compensation from the defendant,

770
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,570
the correlations between depression and suicide,

771
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:40,420
and correlations between suicide and work need to be proved.

772
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,310
But late Mr. Kim Tae Hyeon's depression

773
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,350
- started before joining the company.
- That's—

774
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:48,770
Therefore, the defendant's company is irrelevant.

775
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:51,850
No, no.

776
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,260
I don't know how he was when he was young,

777
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,120
but he never showed that tendency after we married.

778
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,600
According to the statements from other salespeople,

779
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,990
the defendant's company wasn't being run the way the plaintiff described.

780
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,390
Since the burden of proof is on the plaintiff,

781
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:11,170
they need to overcome reasonable doubt,

782
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,350
but they aren't able to do that.

783
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,860
Please dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for that reason.

784
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,080
There's one thing I didn't get to explain last time.

785
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:46,480
It's best for you to renounce the inheritance.

786
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,240
It's the simplest option.

787
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,360
But if you renounce the inheritance,

788
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,740
your late father's debt will be transferred to Kim Hyeon Wu.

789
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,540
Don't you think he'll renounce his inheritance, too?

790
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,410
Your father's debt will be transferred to his siblings, then.

791
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,410
The ones who are caring for Hyeon Wu now.

792
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,600
So, they probably won't let him renounce for that reason.

793
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,270
All of that will go to the boy?

794
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,240
Among the things you can do,

795
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,630
there's a system called "Inheritance with reservation."

796
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,190
How does this work?

797
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,970
Renunciation of inheritance simply means

798
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,260
refusing both assets and debt.

799
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,490
But with inheritance with reservation, you pay the debt only using the inheritance.

800
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,810
So, if the debt amount exceeds the assets,

801
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,500
you still won't inherit the debt.

802
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,820
It's the same as renouncing the inheritance to us.

803
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,050
Yes. If you do this, even if Hyeon Wu renounces the inheritance,

804
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,800
the debt won't be transferred to your relatives.

805
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,970
You'll be putting an end to it.

806
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,290
The relatives would let Hyeon Wu renounce the inheritance, then.

807
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,310
That's what we should do, then.

808
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,650
Yes, but there's a bit of an issue with this, too.

809
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,030
Renunciation of the inheritance process ends in

810
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,710
a few days or at least a few weeks.

811
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,270
But inheritance with reservation takes much longer and is complicated.

812
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,140
You'll have to thoroughly look into the details

813
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,790
of your father's assets and debts.

814
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,530
An extra step, such as inheritance bankruptcy, might be required.

815
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,220
I should recommend renunciation of inheritance

816
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,750
if I only considered you two.

817
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,310
But if you could wait a bit,

818
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,110
I'll take care of all the cumbersome processes.

819
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:44,500
How about you consider inheritance with reservation?

820
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,460
Can Jin Ah renounce the inheritance, and I go with the new option?

821
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,170
Yes, that can work.

822
00:57:55,170 --> 00:58:00,170
Doing that will have the same result, right?

823
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,680
Yes.

824
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,260
I'll go with the inheritance with reservation alone.

825
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,140
I'll do it, too.

826
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,530
I thought you'd want to renounce the inheritance.

827
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,830
I don't want us to renounce the inheritance,

828
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,210
and he ends up with the debt. I'd hate that.

829
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,340
Thank you for letting us know, Attorney Kang.

830
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,040
No, I should be thanking you.

831
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,250
We'll go with this, then.

832
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,390
Okay, got it.

833
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,820
We can renounce Hyeon Wu's inheritance, right?

834
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,430
Yes, go ahead.

835
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,150
Let me know when the process is over.

836
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,300
Okay, I will.

837
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,590
Hello?

838
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,810
Yes. Hello, sir.

839
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,910
This is Kim Jun Hyeok.

840
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,010
Who's this?

841
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,770
You came to our office a few days ago.

842
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:29,060
I'm the insurance salesperson.

843
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,910
The one who talked about the statements.

844
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:33,430
Oh, yes.

845
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,670
Do you need insurance, by chance?

846
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:40,300
We have cancer, accident, pension insurance, and everything.

847
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,760
Are you still at work?

848
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,930
Pardon?

849
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:56,820
Well, it's not like that.

850
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,900
Hello?

851
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,760
Hello?

852
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,130
Okay. I'll sign up for one.

853
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,490
Really?

854
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:12,100
Gosh, t-thank you. Thank you.

855
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,990
Geez, you should've done that sooner.

856
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,220
Let's do better.

857
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,860
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Thank you.

858
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:21,220
Thank you. Thank you so much.

859
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,050
Thank you.

860
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:27,680
The Deus GA case ruling came out.

861
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,940
Should I put it here?

862
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,960
Give it to me.

863
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,890
Oh, okay.

864
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:35,030
You won. Congratulations.

865
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,050
I won?

866
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,260
Well, yes.

867
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,350
Thank you.

868
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,740
Sure.

869
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,100
Yes, come in.

870
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,220
The ruling for Ms. Shin Ji Hye's case came out.

871
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,680
What case?

872
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,930
The Deus GA case.

873
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,720
Oh, yes.

874
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,440
Congratulations, we won.

875
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,060
Did you come here to tell me that?

876
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,760
Yes. I wanted to report it to you.

877
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,710
Why would you suddenly report stuff like that?

878
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,300
I wanted to report to you on this case.

879
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:42,040
You didn't use to feel uncomfortable with stuff like this.

880
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,470
Why are you like this this time?

881
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:51,260
I was never uncomfortable.

882
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,100
I was just used to feeling uncomfortable.

883
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,890
I thought you were similar to me.

884
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,140
But I guess not.

885
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,870
No.

886
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,700
I suppose not.

887
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,660
Yes.

888
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,680
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes, Attorney Kang.

889
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,770
- About Kim Jin Yeong and Kim Jin Ah's case.
- Yes.

890
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,770
We decided to go with inheritance with reservation.

891
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,730
We'll renounce the inheritance for the boy.

892
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,390
The appointment fee was deposited, too.

893
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,380
Is that so?

894
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,140
Okay. Since you decided to do that,

895
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,440
I have nothing more to say.

896
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,290
Yes, thank you.

897
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,910
Okay, you can leave.

898
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,910
Aren't you getting dinner?

899
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,730
I should.

900
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,310
Did the case go well?

901
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,110
We're going with the inheritance with reservation.

902
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,770
That's good. Good work.

903
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,760
How about you?

904
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,520
I won.

905
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,490
You did so much.

906
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,770
Thank you.

907
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,930
Our table is...

908
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:18,100
Five tonkotsu ramen and three gyoza, please.

909
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,760
- Could you pass the soy sauce?
- Thank you.

910
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,490
- What?
- She wants soy sauce.

911
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,680
- Here.
- Thank you.

912
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,930
Why is your hand so cold?

913
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,940
My hands and feet get cold when I'm stressed.

914
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,270
Is something going on?

915
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,300
There isn't.

916
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:41,310
Except that the managing partner is trying to fill my position.

917
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,080
What happened?

918
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,010
She's probably talking about him trying to post a job opening.

919
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,280
Don't think about it too much.

920
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,380
- What did he say?
- He said not to think about it too much.

921
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,440
Don't think about it too much.

922
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,760
- Thank you.
- She said, "Thank you."

923
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,470
- She said, "Thank you."
- She said, "Thank you."

924
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,570
Don't mention it.

925
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,690
Okay.

926
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,840
Good work, everyone.

927
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,760
Good work.

934
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,890
You took on a case you usually don't.

935
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:18,590
- Is this all?
- What kind of case is this?

936
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,730
I heard they can't pay the appointment fee.

937
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,550
Are you worried about your grandfather?

938
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:29,340
There's no reason for killing someone.

939
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,060
Long time no see.

940
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:34,480
- Please leave.
- It was just bad luck.

941
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,600
I can't work with you if you keep doing this.

942
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,770
Why are you taking it so far?

943
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,450
Are you sure you don't gain anything at all?

944
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,990
Do you only do what's beneficial?
