4
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,190
What are you looking at
with such interest?

5
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,700
What brings you here?

6
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,280
I was about to ask you the same.

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,570
What brings you here?

8
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,410
It was written in the handover notes.

9
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,580
It said to come here
when I needed to relax.

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,710
He sure made the handover notes detailed.

11
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,170
I come here often to run.

12
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,340
Did you just go for a run?

13
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,380
Didn't you see me?

14
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,260
-I didn't.
-I'm pretty sure you did.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,260
-Why would I lie about that?
-You're good at lying.

16
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,100
You really are a strange person.

17
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,400
When have I ever lied?

18
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,150
Back then, in Hong Kong.

19
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,530
We never said we'd meet again
once we returned to Seoul.

20
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,950
Just be honest.

21
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,040
You remember, don't you?

22
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,870
It came back to me afterward.
It came back to me but--

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,580
You remembered from the very start.

24
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,670
Also, you clearly asked me
to meet you in Seoul.

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,050
If there's a spotâ€¦

26
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,470
like this in Seoul,
want to go together?

27
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,720
Where?

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Gangnam Station.

29
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,440
Gangnam Station.

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,350
We even picked a date and place.

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,560
Right, we did.

32
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,650
So?

33
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,320
But you're the one who canceled it.

34
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
I did?

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,570
By the way,

36
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,990
do you think we'll be together
back in Seoul?

37
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,790
Wellâ€¦

38
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,750
We agreed to meet up in Seoul.

39
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,620
But we didn't actually
make any solid plans yet.

40
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,720
Since we're on a trip, I thought maybe
we're just caught up in the mood and all.

41
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,180
How is that canceling our plans?
That's not what I meant.

42
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,810
That is what you meant.
What else could it be?

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,070
Don't you know what "be together" means?

44
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,780
Come on. That's not the vibe
you gave off back then.

45
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,410
If it was, then why did you
ghost me in Seoul?

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,290
That's just more proof
that you wanted to cancel.

47
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,670
I didn't ignore you on purpose.
Back then, my phone--

48
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,720
Don't tell me you lost your phone.

49
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,630
You're right. I lost it.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,190
I arrived at the airport for my flight,
but I couldn't find it anywhere.

51
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,560
Geez!

52
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,530
Since your number was saved on that phone,
I couldn't switch to a new one.

53
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,870
I even emailed the places in Hong Kong
but never found it.

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,490
I'm supposed to believe that?

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,990
Geez, you're such a strange person.

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,330
Why won't you believe me?

57
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,870
Because you're a good liar.

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,750
When did I ever lie to you?

59
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,840
In any case, you were the one
who said we should meet up.

60
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,510
Why say it
if you weren't going to show up?

61
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,720
Because I liked you.

62
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,770
Back then. Not now.

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,980
Yes, I know.

64
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,570
You were pretty and kind back then.

65
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,780
Now, it seems you've become kind of weird.

66
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,160
Who? Me and not yourself?

67
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,950
You're still pretty though.

68
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,420
You're not heading back?

69
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,930
I was about to.

70
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,510
Let's go.

71
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,020
Episode 3
How to Separate Work from Personal Life

72
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,690
I'm sorry about Jang Hyeonseok's case.

73
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,570
It was your case,
but I acted like I knew better.

74
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,740
I still don't think I was wrong,

75
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,750
and I believe the judge
should've been shown that precedent.

76
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,420
But I can't deny that I was being nosy.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,090
I never even thought about it
from the standpoints you mentioned.

78
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,680
Are you apologizing right now?

79
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,640
I have to admit what's true.

80
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,720
But like you said, I'm just a first-year.

81
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,480
What's the worth of going all out
to fight a first-year over that?

82
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,770
If I didn't know,
you could've just explained it nicely.

83
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,570
By the way, didn't you say
you were a piano major then?

84
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,280
I never imagined you'd become a lawyer.

85
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,790
I totally knew you'd become a lawyer.

86
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,670
Well, obviously.
I was a law student back then.

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,840
That doesn't guarantee you'll make it.
You could've failed the exam.

88
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,880
Me?

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Then, why would your handover notes say
to ask me if you didn't know something?

90
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,470
It's because I'm good.

91
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,430
What's the use?

92
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,640
You're so scary I can't even ask.

93
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,440
Fine. I'll help you as much as I can.

94
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,440
Nicely?

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,770
Well, I can't promise that.

96
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,490
-Then, can I ask you something now?
-Right now?

97
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,870
When were you planning to start? Tomorrow?

98
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,950
Go ahead.

99
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,710
What do you do when you're assigned a case
you don't want to take?

100
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,590
What employee actually gets to do
what they want?

101
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,510
You just do the job
without thinking about it.

102
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,010
Still, we're not just regular employees.

103
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,510
We get a paycheck, don't we?

104
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,060
We're the same.

105
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,390
We're lawyers though.

106
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,640
Just salaried lawyers.

107
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,350
I can't agree with this mindset either.

108
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,360
But fine.

109
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,900
It means even you have cases
you don't want to handle, right?

110
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,650
Yes. Family cases.

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,410
There's too much emotion involved
with the parties, so it's exhausting.

112
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,950
Aren't family cases
the most interesting ones?

113
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,710
Things like affairs, divorces,
and inheritances.

114
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,500
You think cheating, broken families,
and people dying are interesting?

115
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,340
When you put it like that,
it doesn't sound so good.

116
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,100
You tried to make me feel bad
on purpose, didn't you?

117
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,680
I told you to let me know nicely.

118
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,680
I said I couldn't promise that.

119
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,400
PRECEDENT ON PUNISHMENTS
FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE

120
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,010

125

OUR TEAM

126
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,060
I guess the merger really did happen.

127
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,980
Right? What kind of company
merges in just two weeks?

128
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,440
There are 15 lawyers in total,

129
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,520
but four are managing partners?

130
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,610
Out of 15 lawyers,
around 10 are members of the team.

131
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,360
And only five are associates.

132
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,280
You mean the other members
are partners, right?

133
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,700
Yeah, and they all operate separately.

134
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,120
Still, we're all under one roof now.

135
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,580
We're not in the same company.

136
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,500
Technically, we are in the same company.

137
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,790
Don't kill the mood.

138
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,630
Thanks. You're the best.

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,050
What's with Changwon's photo?
Where did he take this?

140
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,970
Seriously,
are you some kind of musician?

141
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,550
What? It came out great.

142
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
-No, it's…
-The break room's nice, isn't it?

143
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,310
-Hello.
-Hello.

149
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,530
Nice to meet you.

150
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,790
Make yourselves at home.

151
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,170
Let me know if you need anything.

152
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,370
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

153
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,220
Well, my office is over there.

154
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,340
-Yes.
-Right.

155
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Have a good day.

156
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Gosh.

157
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,980
What exactly do you do
as an advisor though?

158
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,650
Maybe she adds people to a vise.

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,060
SAEMUN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

179
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,520
When did my son's hands get this big?

180
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,860
I'm so proud of you, my son.

181
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,150
Because you're such a strong boy.

182
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,620
-What's going on?
-Geunhwan?

183
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Doctor?

184
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
Doctor!

185
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,250
-Geunhwan.
-Doctor!

186
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,380
Geunhwan?

187
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,670
Honey, get out of the way.

188
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,840
-Move.
-Geunhwan?

189
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,170
Call a Code Blue.

190
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,800
Geunhwan?

191
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,560
Geunhwan!

192
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,910
There's no way our professor
made a surgical error.

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,080
By the way,
how do you two know each other?

194
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,130
I'm Kim Jeongsu,
head of Administration at the hospital.

195
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,880
I told them I could come alone,

196
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,380
but I think the hospital
wanted someone with me.

197
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,390
You're not the only defendant.
The hospital is too. That's why I'm here.

198
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,970
This is the surgery footage.

199
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,600
As you'll see, he didn't make any mistakes
during the operation.

200
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,650
Were you aware that the surgery
was being recorded?

201
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,740
Yes, we film every procedure
from start to finish.

202
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,820
-Did he die on the same day?
-Yes, in the evening.

203
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,660
-Any criminal charges?
-Yes.

204
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,370
But medical negligence wasn't found,
so they were dismissed.

205
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,080
I believe the family is trying
a civil suit as a last resort.

206
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,090
Looking at the complaint,
they didn't make any new claims.

207
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,550
Are you here to keep Prof. Ku quiet?

208
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,550
What?

209
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
No, not at all.

210
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,230
You've been answering everything for him.

211
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,520
So I was just wondering
why he wasn't allowed to speak.

212
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,860
No, there's nothing like that.

213
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,440
What kind of surgery
did the patient receive?

214
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,780
He had diverticulitis.

215
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,290
But there was a perforation,
so we couldn't do a laparoscopy

216
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,000
and did an open surgery instead.

217
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,830
After the surgery,
he suddenly went into shock and died.

218
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,340
"Diverticulitis."

219
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,800
Sorry, I'm not familiar,
but what exactly is that?

220
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,130
It's when little, bulging pouches develop
in the wall of the colon.

221
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,680
If waste gets trapped in those pouches,
it can lead to inflammation,

222
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,430
and they can often rupture.

223
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,140
-So in this case, there was a perforation?
-Yes.

224
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,230
It's a claim for damages,

225
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,320
saying the surgery was negligent,
the risks weren't properly explained,

226
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,990
and the surgeon arrived late.

227
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,160
Can't I just apologize

228
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,410
-and end this with a settlement?
-Professor.

229
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,240
You said you would stop saying that.

230
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,330
Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

231
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,130
So, you've been a surgeon
for quite a while, right?

232
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,300
Yes, wellâ€¦

233
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,220
It's been about 20 years.

234
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,260
Then, this probably wasn't
the first time you've lost a patient.

235
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,640
No, it wasn't.

236
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,770
Do you usually

237
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,230
apologize and settle with the family
whenever this happens?

238
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
No.

239
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Not always.

240
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,820
Then, may I ask why
you want to apologize this time?

241
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,490
I've never lost a patient
this young before.

242
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,410
As a doctor, I hate saying
some lives matter more than others,

243
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,460
but this one's been hard.

244
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,670
But an apology could be used
as evidence of negligence.

245
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,550
Please think about the hospital too.

246
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,710
That may not necessarily be the case.

247
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,300
If there's no other evidence
of surgical malpractice,

248
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,890
an apology alone isn't enough
to prove liability.

249
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,510
Still, it could make the hospital
look at fault,

250
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,770
and that could blow things up even more.

251
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,810
On top of that,
you want to offer a settlement too?

252
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,060
When we were sued,

253
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,270
wasn't it enough
to stop me from apologizing?

254
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,230
Now that we've been cleared,

255
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,650
let's apologize and settle things.

256
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,410
I said we can't do that, Professor!

257
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,290
Would it be possible for me
to attend the trial?

258
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,050
You're not required to appear,
but you can if you'd like.

259
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,510
Then, I'll see you at the trial.

260
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,390
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

261
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,510
All right, then.

262
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,230
I'm telling you,
I have no way of finding that out.

263
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,940
You can just sit in on the trial.

264
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,900
I'll let you know
the courtroom number and time.

265
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,950
I can't go there during work.
It's not even my case.

266
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,370
Dad, I'm an office worker too, okay?

267
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,580
I snuck out just now
and have to get back soon.

268
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,370
If Hanguk Group goes down,
our company goes down with it.

269
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,040
Hanguk Group makes trillions.

270
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,130
Losing one trial won't ruin them.

271
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,000
-That's not so for companies.
-Gosh.

272
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,840
It's the little things
that pile up and weaken them.

273
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,300
It's our job to pay attention
to things like these.

274
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,430
I know you subcontract for Hanguk Group,

275
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,760
-but this is too much of a fuss.
-As it should be.

276
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,260
They put food on our table.

277
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,930
Everything you've enjoyed came from them.

278
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,890
Not anymore. Count me out.

279
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,940
Wanting out won't make it happen.
We're a family business.

280
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,440
Family business, my foot.

281
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,070
Goodness.

282
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,120
Get your rice cakes!

283
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,250
For crying out loud.

284
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,830
-You going around selling rice cakes now?
-You little…

285
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,090
Who still uses
bojagi wrapping cloth like this?

286
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,590
I'm busy. Move.

287
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,630
Later.

288
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,650
You look young.

289
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,280
Thank you.

290
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,490
Are you really a lawyer?

291
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,740
-Yes.
-How many years in?

292
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,330
Me?

293
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,330
About seven or eight years.

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,830
Really? So you're not a newbie.

295
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,210
A law school graduate?

296
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,630
-Yes.
-You must come from money.

297
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Sorry?

298
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,380
Nothing. Please keep reading.

299
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,230
Yes, hello?

300
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,480
Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

301
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,780
I'm reaching out
through Ms. Kang Jeongyun.

302
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,360
Yes, I heard. Hello.

303
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,830
Hello. Whenever we have a medical lawsuit,

304
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,540
I heard you consult for us.

305
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,290
Thank you, as always.

306
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,160
Did you get a chance
to review the footage we sent?

307
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,580
Yes, I did.

308
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,210
But there was nothing strange about it.

309
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,460
His hands seem a little slow,
but some doctors just work slowly.

310
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,970
-Then, what caused the shock?
-It's usually unpredictable.

311
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,760
And there are thousands of causes.

312
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,520
Sudden deaths like this
are beyond what humans can control.

313
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,190
I see. Thank you for your time, Doctor.

314
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Goodbye.

315
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,880
We'll proceed with the next case.

316
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,930
Civil case number 2024-24215,
please step forward.

317
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,520
Plaintiff, Min Subin.
Defendant, Gonggang Industries.

318
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,650
I didn't say you could sit.

319
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
I apologize.

320
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,030
Please be seated.

321
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,040
Yesterday, we submitted a request
to present financial transaction records.

322
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,710
Request denied.

323
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,290
But Your Honor, as I explained,

324
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,210
the defendant is using the same name
as Gonggang Construction

325
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,880
and likely mixed
financial transactions with them--

326
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,680
This court is not an institution
for collecting evidence

327
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,220
of such a broad range.

328
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,640
Request denied.

329
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,810
But we've explained why it's necessary--

330
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,230
Nothing further from either side,
I assume?

331
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,560
No, Your Honor.

332
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,310
Then, we'll end proceedings.

333
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,110
The verdict is set
for the 24th of January…

334
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,170
That's insane!

335
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,720
-Damn it, that scared me.
-Right?

336
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,050
Even if he's not at fault,
someone died and he wants to apologize.

337
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,810
Isn't wrong to stop that?

338
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,770
-That's just plain wrong!
-Right?

339
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,060
-Maybe the doctor was at fault.
-That's not it.

340
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,190
He was cleared in the criminal case
with no sign of malpractice.

341
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,560
There's no risk,
but they won't let him apologize.

342
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,820
What's diverticulitis? Could you explain?

343
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,070
Sanggi, look.

344
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,530
Let me show you.
If your colon is shaped like thisâ€¦

345
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,660
The small, bulging pouches
are diverticula.

346
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,080
They're prone to inflammation
and perforation,

347
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,410
so they usually remove them
with laparoscopy.

348
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,370
But inflammation means open surgery.

349
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,420
Wait, how do you even know that?

350
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,050
What? You said to help
if you didn't know something.

351
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,220
But I knew very well this time.

352
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,590
Don't empathize.

353
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,340
It's just work.

354
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,430
If you empathize, you'll lose objectivity
and hinder your work.

355
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,230
Juhyeong, stop pretending like
you're choosing not to empathize.

356
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,730
You don't empathize,
because you can't feel anything.

357
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,190
It's not by choice, okay?

358
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,150
You two are bantering a lot more now.

359
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,780
I thought we'd gotten closer.

360
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,610
Yeah, I am closer with you.

361
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,910
-Right?
-Yeah.

362
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,950
Did you just wink?

363
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,250
-Want one too?
-This day's been so brutal.

364
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,840
Goddamn it.

365
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,590
-Wet wipes.
-Wet wipes.

366
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,010
Hey, use this first.

367
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,090
-In the back.
-Hey.

368
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,700
Yes?

369
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,910
Ma'am, I just got back
from the verdict for Kang Yungu's case.

370
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
We won 650 million won.

371
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,590
-Really? That's a relief.
-Yes.

372
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,920
I'll let you know
once the judgment's delivered.

373
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,380
-Okay, thank you.
-Sure.

374
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,050
At least that's good news.

375
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,310
KANG YUNGU

376
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,190
-Hello?
-Did you hear the verdict?

377
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,980
-Yes, I did. Thankfully--
-Why is it only 650 million won?

378
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,820
I filed for 700 million won.
Where's the rest?

379
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,410
About that.
The 50 million was confirmed as repaid.

380
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,950
We planned to reduce
that part of the claim anyway--

381
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,620
I said I didn't get that money.

382
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,580
You received the 50 million
and it's all on record.

383
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,130
What are you going to do
about the 50 million won?

384
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,340
Mr. Kang,
out of the 700 million we claimed,

385
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,640
about 400 million
had no direct evidence of--

386
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,390
If the court recognized all 700 million,
why did we only win 650 million?

387
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,940
Why did you lose 50 million won? Why?

388
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,660
-Attorney Ahn.
-Yes, what is it?

389
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,990
What? Are you hungry?

390
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,790
No, it's not that.

391
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,300
-Here.
-I said it's not that.

392
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,240
Want to grab drinks later?

393
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,280
Are you an alcoholic? Give it a rest.

394
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Okay.

395
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,200
Thank you for the snack.

396
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,460
When do you want to grab dinner?

397
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,920
I have dinner plans.

398
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,550
Everyone's busy.

399
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,220
Got it. Bye.

400
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,780
Something feels off.

401
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,580
What could it be?

402
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,040
MEDICAL RECORD

403
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,760
PERFORATION

404
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,190
Attorney Bae, did we lose Mr. Kang's case?

405
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,810
Sorry? Lose his case?

406
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,020
Yes, Mr. Kang is in an uproar right now.

407
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,950
Sir, we won 650 million
out of 700 million.

408
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,160
Then, why is he going nuts
and saying we lost?

409
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,990
I have no idea either.

410
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,790
It was confirmed the 50 million
was already repaid,

411
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,370
-so we suggested reducing the claim--
-Got it. Let's talk again tomorrow.

412
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,010
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

413
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,470
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

414
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,900
Couldn't this be seen
as another person's life?

415
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,900
Lately, the courts have been narrowing
their definition of another person's life

416
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,360
-in breach of trust cases.
-No.

417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,950
-No, look at this clause right here.
-Here?

418
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,490
-This one?
-No, here.

419
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,120
I didn't see this before.

420
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,240
Cheers.

421
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,370
By the way, are you really a lawyer?

422
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,580
Truth is, I'm not.

423
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,130
-What?
-I'm a K-pop idol.

424
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,260
-Come on.
-It's the truth.

425
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,430
I wasn't a famous K-pop idol.

426
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,550
But I really was one.

427
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,430
And one day, I thought about
giving studying a shot and--

428
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,770
MUNJEONG

429
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,030
Bastards.

430
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,490
They're never around
when you actually need them.

431
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,390
Let's finish this up tomorrow.

432
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,770
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

433
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,610
If you don't have any plans,
do you want to grab a beer?

434
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,280
Well, are you buying?

435
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
Of course.

436
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,410
-In that case, sounds good.
-Okay.

437
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,080
I'll go wrap up then, ma'am.

438
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,330
-Okay.
-All right.

439
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,380
Ma'am, my hands are full.
Could you open the door for me?

440
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,310
Okay.

441
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,930
She didn't even open the door for me.

442
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,070
Gosh.

443
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,700
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

444
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,450
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

445
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,210
-Call me when you get home.
-Okay.

446
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,510
Is everyone busy?

447
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,010
You're not the only busy ones.

448
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,470
Ptooey! Screw you.

449
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,810
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

450
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,360
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

451
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,550
Let's go now.

452
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,590
Let's go.

453
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,520
-You're always here late--
-My goodness!

454
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,730
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

455
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,440
Hello, Ms. Kim.

456
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,200
-Are you going home now?
-Yes.

457
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,490
But what are you doing here at this hour?

458
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,620
Well, I was just on a little patrol.

459
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,960
No one told you to do that, right?

460
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,920
No, that's not it. I just felt like it.
It's mine, after all.

461
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,510
Yours?

462
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,590
Wellâ€¦

463
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,890
The company and the building are all mine.

464
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,930
Hyungmin Building.

465
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,480
Kim Hyungmin.

466
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,190
-I see!
-Yes.

467
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,240
Okay, get home safe.

468
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Thank you.

469
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,240
Feel free to swing by my office next time.

470
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,040
Yes, I will.

471
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,620
-Okay.
-I'll get going.

472
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,290
I'm off.

473
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,460
-Hey, aren't you going to eat?
-Nope.

474
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,850
Damn it.

475
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,850
Wake up and get ready for work.

476
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,660
Okay.

477
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,720
It's my day off today.

478
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,590
Day off?

479
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,760
Yeah.

480
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,940
How long are you going to
sulk like that for?

481
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,270
What's everyone so busy with?

482
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,490
Sorry, I saw your message late last night.

483
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,160
Let's not call coworkers late at night.

484
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,820
Or I'll report you for harassment.

485
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,990
Since when are we coworkers?

486
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,990
We work at the same company now.

487
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,870
Hey, I begged like crazy,
but you wouldn't drink with me.

488
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
How are we coworkers?

489
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,090
You can just have drinks
with your husband.

490
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,210
He's no fun.

491
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,710
-He's not?
-Nope.

492
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,670
Do you all know him?

493
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,430
Not all of us.
He's Juhyeong's high school friend.

494
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,930
Still, they're a good match.

495
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,050
That's why I introduced them
to each other.

496
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,890
They hit it off, got married,
and are still doing well now.

497
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,680
-Happily together.
-All lovey-dovey.

498
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,350
-As they chit-chat.
-Cut the crap.

499
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,770
Good match, my foot.

500
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,190
You're expressing exhaustion
with every fiber of your being.

501
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,610
Did you work late last night?

502
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,870
Yes, I was looking into that medical case.

503
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,700
You said the surgery went fine.
Why keep digging?

504
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,410
I know,

505
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,540
but something just keeps feeling off.

506
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,290
Gut feeling is a science too, you know.

507
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,920
How is that a science?
It's just a feeling.

508
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,800
No, gut feeling is based on big data.

509
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,840
Your gut feeling emerges
from your lifetime of experiences.

510
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,800
I didn't know it had a philosophy.

511
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,560
No, Munjeong.
This is what you call insight.

512
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
She knows her stuff.

513
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,100
No.

514
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,400
No, you have to fist bump.

515
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,900
-Geez.
-You're kicking up dust here.

516
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,730
-Why use your palm?
-Anyway,

517
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,360
are you two going to
keep speaking formally to each other?

518
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,200
No, I can drop the honorifics.
But he doesn't, so I don't either.

519
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,620
You don't use it for the right people.

520
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,870
Who don't I use it for?

521
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,000
I wonder who. Who could it be?

522
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,630
With me, you punk.

523
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,710
-You were born early in the year.
-But I'm still older.

524
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,550
I'm an early '90. You're an early '91.

525
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,550
Right. And Munjeong is a '90,
so we're considered the same age.

526
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,850
Munjeong is a '90. You're an early '90,
so you two are the same age.

527
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,850
Then, us three are the same age. Right?

528
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,310
You are some kind of lunatic.

529
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,690
Look, Munjeong calls me oppa
to show I'm older.

530
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,810
For someone all about logic,
why are you suddenly acting dumb?

531
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,360
What about Sanggi then?
He's an '89, so he's my age.

532
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,820
Does that make you two equal?

533
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,030
You little punk.

534
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,450
Come on, that doesn't make sense.
I'm not that rude.

535
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,490
Enough with that.

536
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,250
You and Huiji should drop the formalities
and speak casually.

537
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Would you like to?

538
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,880
Go ahead if you wish. I'll do as I please.

539
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,460
Are you sure? Fine, don't regret it.

540
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,920
Good.

541
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,680
-We're not going full casual, right?
-I'm not that rude either.

542
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,430
Then, do you want her
to call you oppa now?

543
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,060
What? Oppa.

544
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,310
Juhyeong oppa. Oppa.

545
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
He likes it.

546
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,520
He liked it. He does.

547
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,990
GRANDPA SANGGI

548
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,740
Did you have a rough day yesterday?

549
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,290
CHANGWON OPPA

550
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,130
I'm free today. Let's grab a drink.

551
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,670
HUIJI

552
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,550
Good food always makes you feel better.

553
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,390
It's too late, you punks.

554
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,350
IT'S TOO LATE, YOU PUNKS

555
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,640
My goodness.

556
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,230
What's got you so down?

557
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,820
Well, I asked you to grab drinks,
and you called me an alcoholic.

558
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,950
Hey.

559
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,700
Next time, spell it out
so I can understand properly.

560
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,080
Later.

561
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Goodness.

562
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,810
Attorney Kang,
did Professor Ku go to the trial today?

563
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,780
I told him not to, but his phone's off
and he's not at the hospital.

564
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,070
I think he went anyway.

565
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,570
Hello, Mr. Kim.

566
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,070
Hello, Attorney Kang.

567
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,580
I haven't left the office yet,
so I'm not sure.

568
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,370
I'll check after the trial
and get back to you.

569
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
All right.

570
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,590
Then, I'll see you at the trial.

571
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,550
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

572
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,560
The plaintiff Kim Sanggu

573
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,190
is the father
of the late Kim Geunhwan, correct?

574
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,280
Yes, Your Honor.

575
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,490
Let's start with your complaint.

576
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,120
I see you've submitted
an additional brief today?

577
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,500
Yes, I also submitted
some video and photo evidence.

578
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,290
I apologize for the late submission.

579
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,330
Defense counsel,
have you reviewed this?

580
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,380
No, I have not.

581
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,540
What's the plan?

582
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,170
Would you prefer to respond
to this brief next time?

583
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,800
We'll acknowledge receipt for now.

584
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,350
All right. Then, please sign that.

585
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:54,810
Plaintiff's counsel,

586
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,110
since it came in today,
we haven't reviewed it yet.

587
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,440
Could you walk us through it briefly?

588
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,190
Yes, Your Honor.
Could you pull up Exhibit 8, please?

589
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,450
The defendant, Ku Dongkyun,
attended a tennis tournament

590
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,910
held at an alumni event.

591
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,250
Could you please pause it there?

592
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,540
As you can see, the defendant
is swinging with his left hand.

593
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,670
Please pull up Exhibit 9, please.

594
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,850
Left-handed.

595
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,680
-He's left-handed.
-Yes.

596
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,850
The defendant is left-handed.

597
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,350
But in the surgery footage,

598
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,940
the surgeon is right-handed.

599
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,650
The defendant
did not perform this surgery.

600
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,740
He had someone else operate in his place.

601
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,110
ALLEGATION OF GHOST SURGERY

602
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,580
Defense counsel.

603
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,710
-Yes, Your Honor?
-I believe

604
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:06,170
we'll need a detailed response to this.

605
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,760
We'll review this
and submit a written statement.

606
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,730
What is the matter?

607
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,520
We're here to make an arrest.

608
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,650
That's him.

609
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,860
You're suspected
of assaulting Ku Dongkyun.

610
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,240
You'll need to come with us.

611
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,160
Sir, I'll leave the rest of the trial
in your hands.

612
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,470
Strap him in.

613
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,850
-Excuse me, could you help us?
-Yes.

614
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,860
Thankfully, it's just a mild concussion.
They say he should wake up soon.

615
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,530
Why did he go there in the first place?

616
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,120
Mr. Kim, the deputy director
is asking for you.

617
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,290
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

618
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,050
PROFESSOR KU DONGKYUN

619
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,780
-He's left-handed.
-Yes, the defendant is left-handed.

620
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,160
But in the surgery footage,

621
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,200
the surgeon is right-handed.

622
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,330
This is why something felt off.

623
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,250
The defendant
did not perform this surgery.

624
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,340
He had someone else operate in his place.

625
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,510
Can't I just apologize

626
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,970
-and end this with a settlement?
-Professor.

627
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,800
You said you would stop saying that.

628
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,680
Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

629
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,160
AHN JUHYEONG

630
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,830
-Are you going home?
-Yes. But you're not?

631
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,200
I see. Good luck.

632
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,540
Thanks.

633
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,680
Didn't you say you'd drop
the honorifics with me?

634
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,760
You're not going to?

635
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,850
-No.
-I see.

636
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,310
Need help with something?

637
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,190
Yes.

638
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,080
Well, this is how everyone works,
isn't it?

639
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,830
I didn't complain.

640
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,750
-It turns out it was a ghost surgery.
-A ghost surgery?

641
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,510
The opposing side
submitted a brief the day of,

642
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,220
and I was absolutely blindsided in court.

643
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,350
Show me the surgery footage.

644
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,320
It's this one.

645
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,590
So, if you look here,
the surgeon is right-handed,

646
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,170
but a bunch of evidence shows
the doctor's left-handed.

647
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,130
What did the doctor say?

648
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,850
I haven't talked to him yet.
He's unconscious and was hospitalized.

649
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,810
On the way to court,
the victim's family ambushed him.

650
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,730
Then, once the doctor wakes up,
we'll know for sure.

651
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,400
What's the problem then?

652
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,950
This whole situation is distressing.

653
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,120
So,

654
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,580
you want to believe
your client's innocent, right?

655
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,920
How could I believe that now?

656
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,330
Then, why are you distressed?

657
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,210
Just accept it as is.
Then, it won't bother you.

658
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,420
I'm trying to accept it as is.
That process is what's distressing.

659
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,340
You've never felt that way?

660
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Geez.

661
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,100
Do you know what you do
in times like these?

662
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,190
-What?
-Let's eat something first.

663
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,940
Continuing to sit here
won't help you focus on anything anyway.

664
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
I'm starving.

665
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,910
-Got anything to eat?
-Not at all.

666
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,830
Let's go out and eat.

667
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,990
Sorry.

668
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,680
Thank you.

669
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:02,830
Man, I'm hungry.

670
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,580
Do you…

671
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,420
want to grab a bite?

672
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,800
How do you not have any emergency snacks?

673
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,760
And you do?

674
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,470
Of course, I do.

675
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,890
You need things like energy bars
and chocolate bars

676
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,390
when your energy drops at work.

677
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,060
I didn't expect that from you.

678
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,920
You don't have to accept
that it was a ghost surgery.

679
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,000
You told me to accept it earlier.

680
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,300
You said it bothered you.

681
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,180
Okay, what you need to accept is
the doctor is left-handed.

682
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,640
And the surgeon is right-handed.
That's all.

683
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,310
Because you have proof.

684
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,980
But there's no proof
that it was a ghost surgery.

685
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,400
It was a ghost surgery.
They logically proved it.

686
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,440
Sure, logically right
based on common sense.

687
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,940
But that's our common sense.

688
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,490
My goodness!

689
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,410
-Who's that?
-Munjeong's husband.

690
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,830
He works as a scrub nurse
at a university hospital.

691
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,670
Hello.

692
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,380
-Are you done?
-Yes.

693
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,750
Let's head up.

694
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,850
How do you explain this?

695
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,360
It's like…

696
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:40,610
dragging a friend out
in the middle of the night

697
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,860
for no real reason.

698
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,450
What?

699
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,240
All left-handed surgeons operate
with their right hands.

700
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,250
I bet they can't operate left-handed.

701
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:52,120
Does that make sense though?

702
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,750
To the general public, maybe not.

703
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,960
But for us, it's common knowledge.

704
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,630
Hey, kindly explain it a bit more.

705
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,550
Got it.
Okay, let me break it down.

706
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,640
Your first time assisting?

707
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,520
Yes. I'll do my best.

708
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,860
Surgical training is basically
old-school apprenticeship.

709
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,110
Scalpel.

710
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,030
But since things are passed down that way,

711
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,950
some things never change.

712
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,820
-Are you left-handed?
-Yes, Professor.

713
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,950
Didn't your seniors tell you?

714
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,120
What do you mean, sir?

715
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,080
Your hands bump
while facing each other,

716
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,630
so you have to match
your mentor's dominant hand.

717
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,750
Usually, the right.

718
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,010
Hey. If you can only use
your left hand, get out.

719
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,840
-I'm sorry. I'll do it again.
-Get out.

720
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,180
That's why most surgeons
operate right-handed

721
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,390
even if they're left-handed.

722
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,270
Or they become ambidextrous.

723
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,810
Anyways, suspecting a ghost surgery
just because of this

724
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,060
doesn't hold up.

725
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,730
Did that help?

726
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Yes.

727
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:05,950
You can go now.

728
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,950
-What?
-Go.

729
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,290
What am I, your pet?

730
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,540
Yanking me around
like I'm on a leash.

731
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,790
So I'll go, but you owe me a meal.

732
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,130
-Okay. Go.
-I'll ask for a fancy meal.

733
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,960
Thanks! That meals on me.

734
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,420
It's okay.
He'll just owe me something fancy.

735
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:25,630
-Thank you.
-See you.

736
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,720
-Bye.
-Later.

737
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,020
You owe me a meal instead.

738
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,850
Should I buy Munjeong a meal?

739
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,360
Just kidding.
I'll treat you to one. Thanks.

740
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,660
Okay, everything's sorted.

741
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:50,660
Are you that happy?

742
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,580
Of course, I am!

743
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,540
My client's not some terrible person.
That's such a relief.

744
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,250
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

745
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,420
Let's head out.

746
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,720
Sure.

747
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,960
Come in.

748
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,470
Mr. Na said to assign this case to you.

749
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:53,890
Okay, you can leave it there.

750
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,140
Okay.

751
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,380
PETITION
COUNTERCLAIM

752
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,470
A divorce.

753
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:45,190
What are you doing?
You should've knocked first.

754
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,030
I was just taking a five-minute break.

755
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,360
I was going to get back to work
after one comic.

756
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:54,820
Sure, if you say so.

757
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,490
It's not "if you say so."
It's true.

758
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,410
You always pop in whenever I take
a quick five-minute break.

759
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,160
All right. I didn't say anything.

760
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,830
Anyways, you want to switch cases with me?

761
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Switch cases?

762
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,260
You said the sale proceeds case
was tough, right?

763
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,010
I'll trade you for a divorce case.

764
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,180
Sure. Did you clear it with Mr. Na?

765
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,550
I was just about to.

766
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:19,310
But what gives?
You want to swap cases?

767
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,020
Well, you'll find out
once you start on it.

768
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,860
-So it's a deal?
-Yeah.

769
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,570
He really hates taking divorce cases.

770
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:39,040
-Sir, can I come in?
-Yes, come in.

771
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,920
Sir, it's about the divorce case
you assigned me.

772
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,800
The Cha Jeongho case?

773
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,630
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, what about it?

774
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,300
I haven't done divorce cases in a while.

775
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,390
-Right.
-And usually,

776
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:59,640
clients prefer
female attorneys with divorces.

777
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:07,270
Since when do you say
you don't want to do something?

778
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,940
It's not that I don't want to do it.

779
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,780
-For various reasons, instead of--
-I get what you're saying.

780
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,200
But the client, Cha Jeongho,

781
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:20,700
specifically requested a male attorney,
so we don't have a choice.

782
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:25,040
-Then, that just leaves you.
-I see. He asked for a male attorney?

783
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,260
-Do you want me to do it then?
-No.

784
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:36,720
No, I should do it.

785
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,760
-I appreciate it.
-Yes, sir.

786
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,410
Right. Work is work.

787
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,180
How are you feeling?

788
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:21,930
I heard you woke up, so I came right away.

789
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,850
Thank you. I'm feeling much better now.

790
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,560
That's a relief.

791
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,690
I heard Kim Sanggu

792
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,610
claimed it was a ghost surgery?

793
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,780
Yes.

794
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,950
But I'm aware left-handed surgeons
often operate right-handed,

795
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:42,450
so I can explain that part clearly.

796
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,000
That's impressive.

797
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,370
Most people don't know that.

798
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,670
There was nothing wrong
with the surgery itself.

799
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,090
But things like this
still seemed to happen.

800
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,510
Every time it happens,

801
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:02,550
I wonder if I'm actually saving lives
through surgery.

802
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,390
If their deaths aren't my fault,

803
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,600
maybe I shouldn't be get credit
for saving their lives either.

804
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,310
That's why you wanted to apologize.

805
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:15,070
But mustering the courage wasn't easy.

806
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,110
I saw the look on your face back then.

807
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,200
But an apology could be used
as evidence of negligence.

808
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,450
That may not necessarily be the case.

809
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:28,660
If there's no other evidence
of surgical malpractice,

810
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,370
an apology alone isn't enough
to prove liability.

811
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,170
I thought you'd be relieved
by what I said,

812
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,340
but you looked surprised.

813
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,380
I do believe I should apologize,

814
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,680
but I just can't find
the courage to do it.

815
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,270
Perhaps, a part of me felt at ease
when Mr. Kim tried to stop me.

816
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,140
Please think about the hospital too.

817
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,980
Because then,
it's not that I didn't apologize.

818
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,400
I was stopped from doing it.

819
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:03,110
I actually saw Kim Sanggu
on my way to court that day.

820
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,290
I saw him.

821
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,040
I couldn't even face him,
let alone apologize.

822
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,800
I deserved to get ambushed.

823
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:29,680
What's going to happen to him now?

824
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,690
I heard he returned home.

825
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,900
But he'll likely be indicted.

826
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:36,980
If I…

827
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:42,280
agree to settle,
will it reduce his punishment?

828
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,990
It would.

829
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,780
I see.

830
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:54,160
I'll go with you.

831
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,250
You'll get the chance
to apologize as well.

832
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,550
Thank you.

833
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,940
Mr. Cha Jeongho?

834
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,690
Yes.

835
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,530
Hello.

836
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,860
I'm Cha Jeongho.

837
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,620
I'm Ahn Juhyeong.

838
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,410
We've agreed to divorce,

839
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:41,590
but we're stuck on alimony
and splitting assets.

840
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Has a trial date been set?

841
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:48,340
Yes, we couldn't settle,
so a trial date's been set.

842
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,470
I mean,

843
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,060
we figured buying lawyers

844
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,730
would only make things messier,

845
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,730
so we both agreed not to buy them.

846
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,190
But at this point,

847
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:04,820
I felt like I needed to do
what was best for me.

848
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,780
You said you agreed

849
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,240
-not to buy lawyers?
-Yes.

850
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,240
Lawyers aren't things you buy and sell.

851
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,330
Really?

852
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,040
That's weird.

853
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,960
I'm here today to buy a lawyer though.

854
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,710
Yes, I see.

855
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,920
Are you far apart on your terms?

856
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,930
I can't give her a cent.

857
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:32,760
Sure, I brought up
getting a divorce first,

858
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,230
but that doesn't mean
I owe her money, right?

859
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,060
Then, you don't need to pay alimony.

860
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,850
I can't give away my assets either.

861
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,020
We've only been married

862
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,110
a little over a year.

863
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,400
It hasn't been that long.

864
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,450
None of my assets came from that marriage.

865
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,910
I covered almost
all the wedding expenses myself.

866
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,250
How much is the other party asking for?

867
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:01,670
She wants 10 million won in alimony
and 10 million won in assets.

868
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,720
Well, it's not actually a lot.

869
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,300
She just wanted a symbolic number

870
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,180
since I first proposed the divorce.

871
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,850
You could've just agreed
and settled this divorce then.

872
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,020
You're pretty well-off.

873
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,610
Why should I?

874
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,990
I'm not backing down.

875
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:35,200
We call it personality differences,
but the divorce is basically her fault.

876
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,450
So you're saying
she has cause for liability?

877
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,910
Well, not technically
cause for liability, butâ€¦

878
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,710
In any case, we're just incompatible.

879
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,760
Totally incompatible.

880
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:54,390
I'm losing my mind.
I can't live with her anymore.

881
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:58,060
Also, it's all on her.

882
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:24,580
NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
PLAINTIFF KIM SANGGU

883
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:54,110
-What are you doing here?
-What?

884
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,740
While heading out,
I was just checking if everyone had left.

885
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:02,120
-Are you clocking out?
-Yeah, I am.

886
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,500
You must be the last one here.

887
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,750
Yeah, Juhyeong left early today.

888
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:09,880
Really?

889
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,960
Let's go.

890
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,050
Okay.

891
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:25,060
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

892
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:53,460
The 10:50 a.m. case.
Family law case number 2023-3330.

893
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,050
Are the parties here?

894
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,140
Are you here for 10:50 a.m. case?

895
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,890
No, the 11:00 a.m. case.

896
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,430
Can I wait inside?

897
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:05,270
I'm sorry, you can't.
Most family law cases are closed trials.

898
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,440
They go one at a time.

899
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Okay.

900
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,900
Are you the 10:50 a.m. case?

901
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,860
-Yes.
-Me too.

902
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,980
Please come in.

903
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,670
Are the parties here
for the 11:10 a.m. case?

904
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,500
Yes.

905
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,130
The 11:10 a.m. case?

906
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:37,970
Please come in.

907
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,120
Who's representing the plaintiff?

908
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,910
I'm Ahn Juhyeong

909
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:08,960
with Law Group Hyungmin,
attorney for plaintiff Cha Jeongho.

910
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,120
Okay, Attorney Ahn Juhyeong.

911
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,540
Who's representing the defendant?

912
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,180
Are you the party in question?

913
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,680
Yes.

914
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
I'm…

915
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,860
Park Sujeong.

916
01:14:53,670 --> 01:15:00,340
Law and The City

917
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:32,370
Law and The City

918
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,540
Crystal Park is his ex-girlfriend.

919
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:39,340
Right now, I'm not Ahn Juhyeong.
I'm just Cha Jeongho's attorney.

920
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,920
You should drop the case.

921
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,800
It's nothing big. It's just a quick visit.

922
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,100
Did you assault her?

923
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,730
I looked you up to see
what kind of person you were.

924
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:54,850
I guess Juhyeong
takes on his friends' cases too.

925
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,980
That's actually
the one type of case he won't do.

926
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:59,110
Excuse me.

927
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,610
I paid with my money to buy you.

928
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,820
I don't let things slide.

929
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
