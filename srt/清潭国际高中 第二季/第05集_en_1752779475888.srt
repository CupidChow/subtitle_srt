[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,633
Let me introduce you

3
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,633
my fiancÃ©,

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,266
Cha Jin Wook.

5
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,533
That's right.

6
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,633
We're engaged.

7
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Don't be mistaken.

8
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,233
What, Baek Jenna?

9
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,300
You put the Equal Opportunity Leech in Diamond 6,

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,500
and now you're even engaged
to an illegitimate child?

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,033
How did you end up like this, Baek Jenna?

12
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,633
I don't think this is the time
for you to worry about me.

13
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,333
But, Yul Hee,

14
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,266
you need to develop better taste.

15
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,200
Your eye for dresses is really

16
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,000
quite poor.

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,866
Hey, don't take pictures!

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,366
I told you to stop!

19
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,633
Hey!

20
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,900
You humiliate me like this
and think you can just leave?

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,833
You crazy girl!

22
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,233
This is your place now,

23
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,033
Min Yul Hee.

24
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,633
This...

25
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:43,700
Let go.!

26
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, Baek Jenna.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,700
Hey!

28
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,900
You!

29
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,800
Hey!

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
Why do you keep showing up everywhere

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,133
to ruin my life?

32
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,166
Did you feel good wearing that
pretty dress? Did you have fun?

33
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,366
Enjoyed playing dress-up?

34
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,933
- Take this off!
- Yul Hee!

35
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,066
How dare you touch someone like her!

36
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,833
Yeah, this is better.

37
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,033
How is it?

38
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,800
Do you like it?

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,033
This is what you should wear.

40
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,733
Who do you think you are to wear such clothes?

41
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:33,233
Doesn't this look more like you?

42
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,833
What?

43
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,966
What?

44
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,733
You crazy bitch!

45
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,100
This insane scum!

46
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Hye In!

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,833
Hye In!

48
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,400
Please, don't follow me.

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,533
I'm begging you.

50
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,266
I won't follow you, just wear this and leave.

51
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,933
On that day, I came to realize

52
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,266
that to Baek Jenna,

53
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,300
I was nothing more than a tool.

54
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,533
Like a piece on a chessboard,

55
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,500
being to be used only when needed

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,866
and then discarded.

57
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:24,333
Was today's incident all planned?

58
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,833
What sudden change of heart is this?

59
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,766
You're right.

60
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,200
Since I stand on the chessboard,

61
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,833
I must place my own pieces.

62
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,100
Clever of you.

63
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,000
I have no intention of losing my spot

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,700
as the heir to Hanmyeong Group

65
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,066
or my position as queen of the Diamond 6.

66
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,666
You'll probably

67
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,800
beat your elder brothers
and become the heir yourself.

68
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
You know everything.

69
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,666
But for some reason,

70
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,566
I feel like that's not the whole story.

71
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,266
The Cha Jin Wook I've observed these days

72
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:59,100
doesn't seem interested
in things like being the heir.

73
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,766
What is

74
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,000
your real motive?

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,066
There's none.

76
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,533
I'm just an ordinary person

77
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,533
striving to achieve what I want.

78
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,833
You? Ordinary?

79
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,533
Anyway,

80
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,500
let's cooperate

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,366
until we no longer need each other.

82
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,400
Fine, let's do that.

83
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,066
[Cheongdam International High School]

84
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,300
What?

85
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,600
[Cheongdam High's Min Yul Hee
got covered in dirt and humiliated]

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,466
Crazy!

87
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,733
She's insane.

88

[Cha Jin Wook, third son of Chasel Medic, engaged
to Hanmyeong Group's daughter Baek Jenna]

89
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,333
Cha Jin Wook's truly legendary.

90
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,400
With Baek Jenna?

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,533
[If Cha Jin Wook becomes engaged to Baek Jenna,
his standing on succession is expected to change]

92

[Cha Jin Wook emerges as Chasel Medic's heir]

93
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,200
Cha Jin Wook?

94

[Min Yul Hee]

95
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:53,166
She needs to know her place.

96
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,900
Where is that Leech going?

97
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,200
Learn where you belong.

98
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,733
Looking forward to it.

99
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,600
After Baek Jenna, you're next.

100
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,333
You never drank decaf before.

101
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,800
Oh, really?

102
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,366
I was told to be careful with caffeine,

103
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,266
Do Un,

104
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,000
can't I visit the Diamond 6 Lounge?

105
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,766
Not just anyone can go in there.

106
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,633
Besides...

107
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,700
I'm not in the Diamond 6 anymore.

108
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,900
Really?

109
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,133
But none of that matters now.

110
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,733
I like being here with you more.

111
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,666
Since when?

112
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,333
Why are you only telling me now?

113
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,633
No, it's just...

114
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,300
it's not a big deal.

115
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,866
This isn't 'a big deal'?

116
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,766
A few days ago, Park Woo Jin...

117
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:09,633
Park Woo Jin?

118
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,500
Do you know him?

119
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,200
You don't, right?

120
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
When did you guys talk?

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,366
Is that what's important right now?

122
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,766
Then what's important? Huh?

123
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,533
Ah, then what's important?

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,500
Hye In, did you get home safely yesterday?

125
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,900
Seriously. Why are people so mean?

126
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's stop talking about that.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,833
Okay.

128
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:51,866
But,

129
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,300
Cha Jin Wook and Baek Jenna's
engagement is causing a stir.

130
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,800
They said they had a formal family meeting
as soon as he returned to Korea.

131
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,033
Did you know? About Baek Jenna
and Cha Jin Wook's engagement?

132
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,366
Of course.

133
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,833
There's nothing I don't know.

134
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,733
Then, do you

135
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,800
know Oh Si Eun too?

136
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:13,966
Oh Si Eun?

137
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:14,966
Of course.

138
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,800
You know, JLK's granddaughter who had an accident.

139
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,366
Accident?

140
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,900
It was a suicide.

141
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,000
Why do you call it an accident?

142
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,266
Ah, right.

143
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,666
Ah, I got confused.

144
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,066
Then, do you

145
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:34,200
know Oh Si Eun's phone disappeared too?

146
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,733
Phone?

147
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,633
Why does that matter?

148
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,833
Are you hiding something from me?

149
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,666
No.

150
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,333
What's wrong with you?

151
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,766
I knew this would happen.

152
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:52,366
What is it? Why have you been acting
this way towards me all this time?

153
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,133
Well, it's just...

154
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,166
I want to see you more often.

155
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,966
Huh?

156
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,533
Ah...

157
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,200
I really didn't want to say this.

158
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Oh! My favorite sausage.

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Hm, delicious.

160
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,666
Excuse me.

161
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,866
I just like spicy pork.

162
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,166
Why aren't you eating?

163
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,566
You have an appetite right now?

164
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,700
You're leaving this?

165
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,166
It's been a while, Ms. Ha Min Hee.

166
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,600
No.

167
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,100
Hanmyeong Group Madam?

168
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,333
It's been a while, Yul Hee.

169
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,000
Since you're welcoming me like this,

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,333
I think it was good to reach out.

171
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,400
I've heard about you often.

172
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,733
Did the rumor that I want to crush Baek Jenna

173
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,400
reach all the way over there?

174
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,333
You could say that.

175
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,566
That's why I'm here.

176
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,800
I think I could

177
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,333
be quite helpful to you.

178
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,366
The same

179
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,233
goes for me.

180
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,466
Mind if I sit for a moment?

181
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:47,066
Sorry,

182
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,933
but I'm not leaving this school.

183
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:49,966
Hey...

184
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:53,100
Let's pretend that never happened.

185
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,100
Can we talk for a minute?

186
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,000
Do you know why Seo Do Un was kicked out?

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,466
Baek Jenna kicked out Seo Do Un

188
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,900
to stick Kim Hye In in his place.

189
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,866
Her friend of 18 years.

190
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,333
While you were hovering between
life and death in the hospital,

191
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,433
you know how Kim Hye In

192
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,933
got in here, right?

193
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:18,766
So?

194
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,300
Between Kim Hye In

195
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
and me,

196
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,800
who's more horrifying?

197
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,766
You know what they say, the enemy of my enemy

198
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,600
can be my friend.

199
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,500
We'll get

200
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,466
very close soon.

201
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,166
[Hanmyeong Group's next generation]

202
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,633
Turn around.

203
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,266
Yes.

204
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,233
Lee Sa Rang,

205
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,966
I know you have Oh Si Eun's phone.

206
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,633
If you don't want it exposed, come here.

207
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,066
- Saturday night at 11.
- What's so serious?

208
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:55,833
Ah, you startled me!

209
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,666
Oh!

210
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,633
Oh my, who is this?

211
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,233
The heir of Hanmyeong Group

212
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,933
has come to such a humble place.

213
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,166
Why are you here?

214
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,333
It may be humble, but have a seat.

215
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,466
You go sit, too.

216
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,333
Sun Joo...

217
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,400
Wow, it's the same uniform,

218
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,033
but this one is just gleaming. It's shining.

219
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
I'll give you a drink on the house.

220
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,133
We have malt whisky here.

221
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,533
How about it, a strong glass?

222
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,066
Just give me a coffee.

223
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,866
Oh, coffee.

224
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,266
When it comes to coffee, that's me.

225
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,766
I won first place
at the international barista competition

226
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:38,800
this year...

227
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,700
Sun Joo,

228
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
stop it.

229
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,300
You live such an easy life.

230
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,833
I guess making a fool out of
someone is nothing to you.

231
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,566
If this is about the party yesterday,

232
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,366
I thought you'd be thanking me.

233
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,033
What?

234
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:01,133
I put you on the same level as Min Yul Hee.

235
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,766
In front of everyone.

236
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,400
Hey, are you crazy?

237
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,266
I never wanted that. What kind of...

238
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:10,066
It was your choice to wear that dress.

239
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,666
I may have given you the dress

240
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,400
and a spot in the Diamond 6,

241
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,366
but it's up to you to live up to that level.

242
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,733
Since you've made a move for me on my chessboard,

243
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,833
I'll grant you a favor later.

244
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,300
This is the material for tomorrow's interview.

245
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,533
Do it well.

246
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,433
I don't need it, so take it back.

247
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,333
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

248
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,633
But the scholarship foundation
won't just stand by.

249
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,066
In the worst-case scenario,

250
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:40,400
it could be revoked.

251
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,633
Hello.

252
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:03,100
I am Kim Hye In, a sophomore
at Cheongdam International High School,

253
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
selected as a scholarship recipient
by the Hanmyeong Scholarship Foundation.

254
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,566
First, I would like to express my gratitude

255
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,000
to Chairman Baek Joo Won

256
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,566
and many officials

257
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,700
who gave me the opportunity to have this interview

258
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,533
in such a joyous and proud setting.

259
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:22,533
Furthermore, I would like to once
again express my deep gratitude

260
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,866
for giving students like me,

261
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:27,500
who entered through the equal
opportunity program, the hope and opportunity

262
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,100
to become a member of Hanmyeong if we work hard.

263
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,266
Thank you.

264
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,666
No CCTV, perfect.

265
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,966
Perfect timing.

266
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:49,800
How dare you humiliate me like that!

267
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Where does a Leech think she's going,
acting all high and mighty?

268
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,133
You are a Diamond 6?

269
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,333
What the heck?

270
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,333
Darn it!

271
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,766
Darn it! Seriously!

272
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,300
Hey, does it hurt?

273
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,933
Does it hurt a lot?

274
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,333
You didn't know?

275
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,000
Life is pain, you scum.

276
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,566
Watch your back at night.

277
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,700
What?

278
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,966
There you are.

279
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,133
You did well in the interview.

280
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,900
Hey!

281
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,600
Hey!

282
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,466
What?

283
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,800
Your interview during the day went well.

284
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,066
Hey, has the issue with that pervert's video

285
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,933
been resolved?

286
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,500
What is this?

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,100
Do you

288
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,766
happen to know anything

289
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:12,233
about Lee Sa Rang?

290
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,066
Lee Sa Rang?

291
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,900
Why?

292
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,066
You've been hanging around together lately.

293
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,200
Could it be...

294
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,966
Could it be, what?

295
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:25,533
Hey, snap out of it.

296
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,900
He's the same as the others.

297
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,800
Just like when Seo Do Un met Kim Hae In.

298
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
Like some kind of

299
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,300
decorative item?

300
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,800
No, that's not it.

301
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,300
A little while ago,

302
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,100
I saw Oh Si Eun's phone

303
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,366
in Lee Sa Rang's bag.

304
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:52,400
Oh Si Eun's phone?

305
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,166
Can I call you Jin Wook?

306
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes, Mother.

307
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,166
Already calling me Mother?

308
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,333
I'm in a good mood.

309
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:21,333
Jenna is getting along well
with Jin Wook too. I'm relieved.

310
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,866
We are getting along much better than you thought.

311
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,200
Your father seems busy lately.

312
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,766
Do you meet often?

313
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,633
Yes, I see him and greet him every day.

314
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,233
It couldn't have been easy
to secure the management shares.

315
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,133
Yes.

316
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,366
So, about that,

317
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,133
Jenna and Hanmyeong Group

318
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,033
will become a great source of strength for you.

319
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,400
Jin Wook, you too

320
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,600
should become an asset to Jenna and Hanmyeong.

321
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
Yes.

322
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:58,666
I should also meet Jin Wook's
mother and pay my respects.

323
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,933
She'll soon become Jenna's mother-in-law,

324
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,466
isn't that right, Chairman?

325
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:06,066
Yes, arrange it when there's an opportunity.

326
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:09,400
My mother will return to Korea soon.

327
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,266
As soon as she returns,

328
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,466
I'll set up a meeting.

329
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,800
Great.

330
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,266
I look forward to meeting her soon.

331
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,966
She raised her son exceptionally well.

332
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:19,466
If our son

333
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:24,200
grows up as fine as Jin Wook,
I'll have no regrets.

334
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,800
Thank you for saying that.

335
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,066
Well then,

336
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:37,333
you two stay a bit longer.

337
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,566
I have a business trip tomorrow
morning, so I'll get going.

338
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,433
Let's meet again in a nice setting next time.

339
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,666
Yes, please get home safely.

340
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,466
Let's go.

341
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,200
Jenna.

342
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,633
What's wrong?

343
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,533
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

344
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll leave too.

345
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:07,300
Did I do something wrong again?

346
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,066
Let go.

347
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,733
If something bothers you, say it.

348
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,533
Don't tell me

349
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:16,800
it's because of what she said,
about hoping your brother

350
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,933
would be like me.

351
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:19,900
Who is my brother?

352
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,233
That illegitimate child?

353
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,533
Why?

354
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,366
Does seeing me make you feel
like crap because it's like looking

355
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,366
at your brother's future?

356
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:34,300
I find his very existence horrifying.

357
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:12,666
[Father]

358
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,033
Yes, Father.

359
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:21,033
Chairman Baek seems to like you a lot.

360
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:26,333
For them to bring up the engagement first,

361
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,466
our Jin Wook is truly outstanding.

362
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:33,533
As expected, you're different from
your brothers, right down to your genes.

363
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,700
Yes, Father.

364
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,533
I'll make sure not to disappoint you.

365
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:41,400
Once we are tied to Hanmyeong through marriage,

366
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
we begin the operation.

367
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,233
Hanmyeong will be ours now too.

368
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:48,566
Make absolutely no mistakes.

369
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,800
Of course.

370
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,666
Yes, get some rest.

371
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,533
How is the acquisition of the
Hanmyeong Holdings shares going?

372
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,000

Oh.

[List of Major Shareholders
and Share Transfer Signatures]

377
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:23,500
What are your plans for Jin Wook?

378
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,600
That bastard?

379
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Once we secure Hanmyeong Group's shares,

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,700
get rid of him discreetly.

381
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,466
Understood.

382
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,600
It's late, Hye In.

383
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,566
Are you eating ramen again?

384
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:53,533
Ramen is surprisingly healthy.

385

You're

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,733
having dinner properly, right?

387
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,200
Of course.

388
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,133
I eat well at the lounge.

389
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,866
I brought this from the lounge.

390
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:14,566
Eat it while you work.

Is it okay to just take these?

393
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,866
Sure.

394
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,766
Dad.

395
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:28,066
Yes, what is it?

396
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,933
I'll do well.

397

I know you'll do well.

00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:46,333
- A gift?
- Yes.

403

I was wondering whom Jenna got her beauty from.

408
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:38,133
As expected, she takes after her mother.

409
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,900
Actually, I do hear that quite a bit.

410
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:45,833
What's up with you?

411
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,266
Oh, Jenna!

412
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,466
You should've introduced us earlier.

413
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,433
I came to pay my respects.

414
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:56,033
Jin Wook is so admirable.

415
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,000
Did you know that?

416
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,466
Someone was sending me flowers
every single day, so I thought it was you.

417
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:04,100
But it turned out to be him.

418
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,000
When you get older, things like this
are so heart-fluttering and nice.

419
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,100
Mother,

420
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,033
I'll make sure you get flowers every single day.

- Really?
- Yes.

422
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,033
So you can always feel that flutter.

Then, I'd be very grateful.

My mom really likes it.

It's been a while since
I've seen her smile like that.

429
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,166
It's the first time I've
seen you smile like that, too.

430
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:49,933
I'm sorry about that day.

to run in places like this.

It's the first time I've seen you smile like that.

Me?

438
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:18,966
Usually, when you smile, your eyes don't smile.

439
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,000
But when you just smiled,

440
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,033
your eyes smiled too.

441
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,966
I learned that smiling is also a skill.

442
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,933
Anyway, from what I can see,

443
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:37,300

sincere with Chairman Cha.

What about your mom?

00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,600
Is she in Singapore?

I didn't know.

453
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,333
I'm just kidding.

454
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,666

You said earlier that you
have to prove your worth.

458

As you know, I'm no different.

459
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:30,533
I have to prove

460
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,600
my worth too.

00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:39,933

00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:47,500
Why are you so curious whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?

In that sense,

00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,318
can I ask one favor?

00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,626
Yes.

It's not too difficult.

Aren't you going to ask why?

473
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,300
No need.

474
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:20,933
Is there really a need to ask?

475
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:24,266
It's something Baek Jenna is doing.

476
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:26,300
There must be a reason for it all.

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,233

478
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,266
May I sit for a moment?

479
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,633
Yes.

480
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:56,600
I knew about you for a while,
but my greeting is late.

481
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,100
I'm Director Seo Hee Kwon.

482
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,300
Yes, I know.

483
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,233
Any issues since returning to school?

484
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,933
No.

485
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:09,433
Everyone treats me well.

486
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,533
Good. That's a relief.

487
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:15,400
You came back after much difficulty,
so you must adapt well.

488
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,933
Yes.

489
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,466
By any chance,

490
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:23,866
if your memories return,

491
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:26,466
make sure to tell me.

492
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,900

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,566
Do you have something to say?

496
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:47,600
No, Director.

497
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,533
But it's polite to greet an elder

498
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:56,300
when you meet one.

499
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,500
Let's talk for a minute.

500
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,333
How long are you going to keep avoiding me?

501
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,066
I was wrong back then. I'm sorry.

502
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,066
You don't need to apologize.

503
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,800
You don't have to.

504
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,066
- I'll take you home later.
- No,

505
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,333
you don't have to.

506
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,766
I don't have time for useless
things like this anymore.

507
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:26,900
Hae In, what are you talking about?

508
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
From now on, you and I

509
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,200
have nothing to do with each other.

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,300
The position Kim Hye In held,

511
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,366
I'll claim it.

512
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,333
That's what's most important to me right now.

513
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,633
To me, you're...

514
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,733
no use anymore.

515
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:45,233
Got it.

516
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,333
I get it for now, so first...

517
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,266

00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,533
are you stupid?

520
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:58,066
The old Kim Hae In was fake.
The current one is real.

521
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,366
You think the Diamond 6 is no big deal?

522
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:03,433
You wouldn't know since you were in it.

523
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:06,366
You'll never understand until you die.

524
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:09,766
Honestly, I liked you
because you were a bit naive.

525
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:12,500
Now, it's getting a little boring.

526
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,166
So, can you stop clinging to me

527
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
and get lost?

528
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,300
Here.

529
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,633
Look.

530
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,900

531
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,066
Thank you.

532
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:53,900
Do you like it?

533
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:58,566
You're coming to the club this weekend, right?

534
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,466
Of course, I'm going.

535
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,533
You, really...

536
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,533
But you

537
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,366
are unexpected.

538
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,933
What are you talking about?

539
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:44,166
Letting Park Woo Jin act like that...

540
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:50,333
Don't tell me

541
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:54,433
you're the only one who doesn't know

542
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:56,933
how pretty and charming you are.

543
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,466
Will you

544
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,800
go somewhere with me?
