Question 39 requires you to select a sentence with a participial particle forming a subsidiary component.

Then we need to first have the concept that the subordinate components are the article and the adverb

It seems so. Huiren, come here for a moment.

60
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,670
Hey, I heard that she pushed Wu Shien to find a special recruiter. Why?

61
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,170
Really? She's crazy.

62
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,510
Special recruited insects actually kill people?

63
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,540
Are we still living in the same room with a murderer?

64
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,300
Did she really kill someone? Damn it.

65
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,610
It's really too scary. Are you crazy? That's what I mean.

66

Poor her. What on earth is she thinking?

67
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,250
Does the special recruited insect kill people?

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,740
I already knew she had no quality.

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,310
Did the special recruit bug kill someone? Is she crazy?

70
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,820
It's really not me

71
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,820

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,810
Why are you so confident when you have nothing?

185
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,830
Because you are at the bottom of the special recruitment circle.

186
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,570

False news...

363
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:47,720
(If you are subject to review by the Student Disciplinary Committee, please attend this week's committee and explain yourself)

364
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,780
School violence

365
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,250
What are you going to wear to the Disciplinary Committee?

366
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,520
Why would you do such a stupid thing?

367
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,590
How could I be punished?

368
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,240
Who knows?

369
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,700
You want to live with that dirty guy?

370
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,600
I have made my words very clear.

371
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,790
but…

372
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,770
I'm not spreading rumors.

373
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,280
I uploaded it because it's real.

374
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,840
It's you.

375
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,270
People who upload that kind of spam

376
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,860
I also know one thing about you that is not a rumor

377
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,980
Kim Hae-in

378
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,040
Who pushed her off the roof?

379
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,340
I think I know

380
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,060
Kim Hye In's dad is so pathetic

381
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,530
what are you doing here

382
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,630
So you didn't know

383
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,610
Your dad...

384
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,750
Kneeling and mopping the floor in the school office

385
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,760
Kim Hye In's dad is here and he did a great job

386
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,050
Please forgive me once...

387
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,120
Are you here, you bitch lady?

388
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,890
Dad, what are you doing? Stand up!

389
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,980
Hurry up, I'm speechless.

390
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,170
You still don't understand the situation?

391
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,110
Even if you kneel down and beg for mercy, I may not forgive you

392
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,640
Please, just once. This is related to the child's life.

393
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:09,190
She's done for now, I'll file a lawsuit for school violence

394
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,120
Let me drop her out of school

395
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,290
Madam...you can't let her drop out of school, Dad.

396
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,620
Where are you touching? It's so dirty.

397
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,070
never mind

398
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,910
I don't want to talk to this uncle any more

399
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,910
Call your mother

400
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,760
Even if your whole family kneels down and begs for mercy, it's not enough.

401
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,220
Where is your mother? Call your mother over

402
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,190
I don't have a mother

403
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,590
I said I don't have a mother

404
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,760
My mom is dead. What the hell are you doing looking for her?

405
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,680
Huiren, come with the teacher.

406
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,370
Huiren

407
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,170
The teacher also knows your mood. The teacher knows everything.

408
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,840
But if you are labeled as a school bully in your current situation

409
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,590
At least 4 years of records will be left in the student register

410
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,020
You won't have to take the certification exam then.

411
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,370
And you will not be able to find a job for several years. Do you understand what the teacher means?

412
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,300
Huiren

413
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
Okay?

414
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,940
I understand now

415
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,720
Ma'am... this is my reality

416
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,700
It will never change...

417
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,670
My Future

418
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,360
I was wrong

419
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,240
I don't want to live like this

420
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,400
I was wrong

421
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,010
Is it a crime to have no money?

422
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,700
I was wrong

423
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,790
No

424
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,510
I will let you know that being rich is also a sin

425
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,480
