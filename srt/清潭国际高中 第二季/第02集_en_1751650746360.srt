1
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,030
[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,900
Ma'am.

3
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,600
<i>Now I understand.</i>

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,970
<i>This is my reality.</i>

5
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,970
<i>And this is my future</i>

6
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,050
<i>that will not change.</i>

7
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,200
I was wrong.

8
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,630
<i>I don't want to live like this.</i>

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,830
I was wrong.

10
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,900
<i>Is being poor a crime?</i>

11
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,200
<i>No.</i>

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,570
<i>I'll make having money a crime too.</i>

13
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,900
I will escort you home.

14
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,600
Okay.

15
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,780
[Baek Jenna is pretty, so she's unaffected.
What does being pretty have to do with it?]

16
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,930
[If you're pretty, do you get
to inherit the company?]

17
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,360
[It might be different if she were a son,
but she's a daughter, right?]

18
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,260
[Would they abandon her
just because she's a girl?]

19
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,130
Have you seen this?

20
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,300
Black Dog?

21
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,130
Black what?

22
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,730
Hello, this is Black Dog.

23
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,170
Today

24
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,400
I brought some very interesting news

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,270
and the complete summary about

26
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,570
romantic Chairman Baek Joo Won's

27
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,870
love affair.

28
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,900
[His mistress, whom he's been seeing
since the beginning of this year,]

29
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
[is the contract teacher, Ha Min Hee!]

30
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,430
Baek Jenna's father's lover is Ms. Ha Min Hee?

31
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,830
Ha Min Hee?

32
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,830
That contract English teacher Ha Min Hee?

33
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,670
Yes!

34
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,870
That's crazy! But how did he find out?

35
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,770
If the kid she's carrying is a boy,

36
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,930
is Baek Jenna done for now?

37
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,800
What to do? It hurts my heart.

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,770
[Currently, she is 5 months pregnant,
and it's said to be a boy.]

39
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,530
[Seo Jae Kyung is an alcohol and drug addict.]

40
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,930
[Will the succession plan for the heir,
Baek Jenna, become unclear?]

41
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,800
If you're going to hide something,
you should hide it well…

42
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,130
Oh, no!

43
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,770
Jenna is watching too?

44
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,230
Is this your work too?

45
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,330
What? That Black Dog?

46
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,230
Are you crazy? We're not thugs.

47
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,330
Why would we do such a thing?

48
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,100
Does Baek Jenna also know
she should be embarrassed?

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,970
Exactly.

50
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,330
Who is this Black Dog guy?

51
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,200
Find him quickly!

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,370
Yes, I will look into it immediately.

53
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,970
I warned you, didn't I?

54
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,200
I won't tolerate any nonsense during my tenure!

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,230
You can't even handle one thing like this,

56
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,270
Mr. Kim Jin Seop…

57
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,630
Oh! Do Un, come in.

58
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,600
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

59
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,070
I told you to come say hello sooner.

60
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,670
When it's just the two of us, call me Uncle.

61
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,670
You're having a hard time because of your dad?

62
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,670
Don't worry,

63
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,370
nothing has changed.

64
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,970
I will protect you till the end.

65
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,030
If you're going through a tough time,
you have to tell me.

66
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,170
Stay strong and square your shoulders,

67
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,100
understood?

68
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,800
Yes, Uncle.

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
That's it.

70
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,830
A sigh is interpreted differently
by the one sighing and the person watching.

71
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,400
Someone else's sigh is seen as sadness,

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,130
while one's own sigh is seen as
despair, or something like that.

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,830
Anyway,

74
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,530
Baek Jenna and "despair"

75
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,470
don't go well together.

76
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,330
Apologize. I'll accept it.

77
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,470
Apologize?

78
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,770
Why should I?

79
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,170
<i>All you do is bully kids.</i>

80
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,930
<i>That's because you were being played
like an idiot, not knowing a thing!</i>

81
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,770
<i>- What did you say?
- Let's say Kim Hae In's poverty isn't a crime.</i>

82
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,100
<i>But what about her trying to extort money
from me, using her poverty as an excuse?</i>

83
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,670
<i>Do you think I was the only one?</i>

84
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,600
<i>He was being blackmailed too.</i>

85
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,530
<i>Kim Hae In slept with Park Woo Jin.</i>

86
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,070
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, come out.</i>

87
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,930
<i>Hey!</i>

88
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,430
Yeah, I didn't expect you'd apologize.

89
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
And Hae In

90
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,830
will wake up.

91
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,730
When that happens, I'll ask everything myself.

92
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,670
Do as you like.

93
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Are you okay?

94
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,470
What if I'm not?

95
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,900
Deep down, you're happy

96
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,270
that I've ended up like this, aren't you?

97
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
No.

98
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,330
I'm worried about you.

99
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,700
Cute, isn't it?

100
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,730
Why are you here?

101
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,270
I moved in.

102
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,530
I was going to tell you beforehand,

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,870
but you wouldn't answer my calls.

104
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,570
You're hurting my feelings, Jenna.

105
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,300
You know that students are the busiest people.

106
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,830
But is there a reason you'd leave Hannam-dong

107
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,570
to come all the way here?

108
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,170
I'm not really into houses.

109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,770
I like looking down from above.

110
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,730
Then enjoy the view, from above.

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,470
Jenna.

112
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,730
I decorated your brother's room.
Do you want to see it?

113
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,330
I think you once said

114
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,370
that used to be your mom's room.

115
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,230
How many empty rooms do you think there are here?

116
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,000
It's south-facing, so it gets great sunlight.

117
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,070
Parents should be in the room
right next to each other.

118
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,530
It's a problem if they're too far away.

119
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,370
No matter how much you hate it,

120
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,470
you have to accept it now.

121
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,630
You're going to have a younger brother.

122
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,900
You should act like a big sister,
be willing to compromise,

123
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,300
and share.

124
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,370
You are smart, Jenna.

125
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,170
You understand what I'm saying, right?

126
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,530
A younger brother?

127
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,730
Even if he's born, he'll just
be a half-rate life, won't he?

128
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,030
<i>I'm truly begging you like this.</i>

129
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,900
<i>If you could just give her another chance…</i>

130
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,870
<i>Please…</i>

131
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,630
<i>My daughter, I made some
delicious curry in the morning.</i>

132
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,730
<i>Make sure to have dinner at home.</i>

133
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,700
Here.

134
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,330
Sun Joo,

135
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,570
have you ever been sued?

136
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,370
Sued?

137
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,100
That jerk Hwang Bo Seok won't agree to settle?

138
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah.

139
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,870
That jerk said he'd sue me for school violence.

140
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,600
I am even investigated
because of the Oh Si Eun incident.

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,530
If the school violence case opens,

142
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,070
it'll be recorded on my school register,
and I'll be expelled.

143
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,500
What?

144
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,130
What about employment in the future?
My life will be over.

145
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,570
But

146
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,830
all of this

147
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,230
is because I didn't know my place
and entered Cheongdam International High School.

148
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,370
Is there any way out?

149
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,570
I've come this far.

150
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,900
I don't want to give up just like this.

151
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
And I don't want anything taken from me.

152
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,930
Right. You can't let them take anything.

153
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,500
You definitely can't give up.

154
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,970
There's only one way.

155
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,370
You have to get into the Diamond 6.

156
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,270
The Diamond 6 is above the law, you know.

157
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,900
Even if they commit a crime,
no one can touch them.

158
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,970
How am I supposed to get in there?

159
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,300
The way I see it,

160
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,900
you don't have any other options right now.

161
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,130
You can only get into the Diamond 6

162
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,270
and receive immunity.

163
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,850
Diamond 6?

164
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,730
Hello?

165
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,700
<i>Baek Jenna, it's me.</i>

166
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,570
<i>I have a favor to ask--</i>

167
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,270
No.

168
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,070
I want to make a deal.

169
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,630
My life is on the line. Let's meet now.

170
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,270
<i>But I can't now.</i>

171
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,270
I could

172
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,770
really end up dying.

173
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,970
<i>I can't go out right now.</i>

174
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,330
You either come to my house or…

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,100
To your house?

176
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,270
Are you crazy?

177
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,070
You want me to get you into the Diamond 6?

178
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,670
I'm not asking for a favor.

179
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,830
I'm proposing a deal.

180
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,230
A deal?

181
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,500
Do you have anything to propose a deal to me?

182
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,630
I'll give you

183
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,630
Min Yul Hee's necklace.

184
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,900
What can you do with that necklace?

185
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,570
Hey, Equal Opportunity Leech,

186
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,230
don't be mistaken.

187
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,630
Diamond 6?

188
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,430
You can never give me something
that matches that class.

189
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,600
I'll do anything.

190
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,030
Just help me this one time, please.

191
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,600
At this rate, my life is completely over.

192
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,570
Yeah, that…

193
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Equal Opportunity Leech.

194
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,930
You probably won't understand.

195
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,200
Because you live looking down
at the world from a place like this.

196
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,900
But as for me,

197
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,130
if I slip up even once, it's really over.

198
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,030
So,

199
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,570
just this one time.

200
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,970
Just once, please.

201
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,230
Just once.

202
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,300
Help me.

203
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,670
Do you know why I called you to my house?

204
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,170
So you could see

205
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,430
why we are different.

206
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,040
What?

207
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,570
If you're done talking, then leave.

208
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,600
You should say something that makes sense.

209
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,300
You crazy punk!

210
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,700
Are you threatening me right now?

211
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,070
Why are you so curious about

212
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,200
whether the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?

213
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,700
I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!

214
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,000
The heir of Hanmyeong Group.

215
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,430
Do you still not get it?

216
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,600
Wow! He's really handsome!

217
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,200
Hey, Baek Jenna!

218
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,800
If I bring something suitable,

219
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,700
we can make a deal, right?

220
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,230
Are you still talking about that?

221
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,550
Baek Jenna?

222
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,030
I was curious,

223
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,610
but now that I've seen your face,

224
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,030
you pass.

225
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,870
Pass?

226
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,570
Who are you?

227
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,600
And while you're good enough now,

228
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,070
come a little prettier tomorrow.

229
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,870
Don't be late.

230
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,230
The elders don't like tardiness.

231
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,630
Ah.

232
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,230
Please continue your conversation.

233
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,670
What is that?

234
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,030
Hey!

235
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,630
Who is that guy?

236
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,690
Stay there.

237
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,070
Jenna, they're hilarious.

238
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,570
They don't even greet you now?

239
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
You look terrible.

240
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,670
How is your mother doing?

241
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,770
She's really shocked, right?

242
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,400
But still, congratulations.

243
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,330
Even though it will be born out of infidelity,
a sibling is still a sibling.

244
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,600
Come to think of it,

245
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,730
isn't Ms. Min Hee really amazing?

246
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,700
For a contract teacher?

247
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,970
Didn't you understand what I said?

248
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,370
I believe I told you

249
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,970
I know who killed Kim Hae In.

250
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,630
Who died?

251
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,070
Kim Hae In didn't die, did she?

252
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,400
<i>Don't you...</i>

253
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,800
<i>ever wake up.</i>

254
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,030
<i>The next time, I might really kill you.</i>

255
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,880
She's lying there like a corpse,

256
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,830
but she's not dead.

257
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,300
Keep that in mind.

258
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,000
You're the one who started it, right?

259
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,470
One of us will end it.

260
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,600
Of course.

261
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,700
But it won't be me.

262
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,370
Dad, Dad.

263
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,770
Go inside and sleep.

264
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,830
Oh! My daughter is back?

265
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,370
- Go inside.
- Okay.

266
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,700
Alright, I'll sleep.

267
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:55,800
[Kim Hye In]

268
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,480
<i>Die!</i>

269
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
<i>Are you threatening me right now?</i>

270
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,270
<i>Are you threatening me right now?</i>

271
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,730
<i>Why are you so curious about whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?</i>

272
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,470
<i>I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!</i>

273
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,830
<i>The heir of Hanmyeong Group.</i>

274
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,030
<i>Do you still not get it?</i>

275
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,270
Hey, Kim Hye In?

276
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,170
Where are you?

277
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,130
What is it? Why did you suggest
meeting in such a creepy place?

278
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,800
You said you wanted to make a deal.

279
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,210
And no one should know about it.

280
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,530
You're dumber than I thought.

281
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,130
I told you, the necklace doesn't matter.

282
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,970
At least there should be some CCTV footage.

283
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,400
What will you do with this?

284
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,600
Really?

285
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,430
Then,

286
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,730
how about this?

287
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,900
<i>You crazy punk! Are you threatening me right now?</i>

288
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,470
<i>Why are you so curious about whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?</i>

289
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,830
<i>I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!</i>

290
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,130
<i>The heir of Hanmyeong Group.</i>

291
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,200
<i>Do you still not get it?</i>

292
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,650
How about it?

293
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,020
Isn't this enough for a deal?

294
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,830
I don't have time.

295
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,940
Will you take it or not?

296
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,730
The more I look at Jin Wook,

297
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,500
the more handsome he looks.

298
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Thank you.

299
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,330
He came from a good bloodline, right?

300
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,470
You take after your mom.

301
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,670
Why are you so late? We have an important guest.

302
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,930
Nice to meet you. We meet again.

303
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,500
Seeing the two of you like this,

304
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,400
I think we could set a wedding date right away.

305
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,100
Whose daughter is this?

306
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,370
You've raised her well.

307
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,070
Oh, you flatter me.

308
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,430
What do you think you're doing?

309
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,670
If I had known it was this kind of
meeting, I wouldn't have come.

310
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,700
- Jenna…
- How can you

311
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,270
go this far and be so selfish?

312
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,370
Sit down and talk.

313
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,130
Baek Jenna!

314
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,930
I'll go see what's wrong.

315
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,770
Sure.

316
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,300
I'm disappointed, Baek Jenna.

317
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,470
Get lost.

318
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,470
It's not like I'm thrilled about this situation,

319
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,430
getting married as soon as I come to Korea.

320
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,470
Marry?

321
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,970
But

322
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,000
it's not so bad that I'd scream about it.

323
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't you think?

324
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,630
It seems like you and I

325
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,030
are both just pieces on a chessboard
laid out by those old folks.

326
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,370
I think we need to do some thinking

327
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,770
about...

328
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,300
whether we'll be pawns...

329
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,330
or if we'll move the pieces ourselves.

330
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,270
Don't we?

331
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,700
Could you please just get lost?

332
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
I also have my thoughts.

333
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,730
Oh, really?

334
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,830
I'm looking forward to it.

335
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,000
Chairman Baek?

336
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,870
He's so lost in his love affair

337
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,670
that he's raised his child like absolute trash.

338
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,330
You should be the one to tame her properly.

339
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,170
Yes, Father.

340
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,300
Do you know why I called you back?

341
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,070
You are different from your elder brothers.

342
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,000
You know that, right?

343
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,100
- Yes.
- You will have to

344
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,270
prove your abilities yourself.

345
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,200
Chairman Baek…

346
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,340
Yes.

347
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,020
Today, I had dinner with my father
and Chairman Baek of Hanmyeong Group.

348
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,330
Baek Jenna was there too.

349
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Don't worry, Mom.

350
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,670
You know that

351
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,300
I don't play games I'll lose, right?

352
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,400
And I think...

353
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,200
it's going to be quite fun.

354
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,100
Mr. Director,

355
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,800
didn't you make a promise to me?

356
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,400
As you requested, Jenna's
disciplinary action is being discussed.

357
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,630
But why is Baek Jenna still walking
around the school so confidently?

358
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,090
As her friend, you know it as well,

359
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,510
that Hanmyeong Group's sponsorship is the largest.

360
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,830
And Jenna is also

361
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,550
the only daughter of Hanmyeong Group.

362
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,110
The mistress of Chairman Baek
was a teacher at our school.

363
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,600
Furthermore, she got pregnant.

364
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,700
And his daughter, Baek Jenna, attends that school.

365
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,970
Don't you think this is enough
to convene an ethics committee?

366
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,230
Just issue the disciplinary action.

367
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,290
Then, I will proceed with the next steps myself.

368
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,800
I'll get Baek Jenna

369
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,460
kicked out

370
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,700
of Diamond 6.

371
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,870
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

372
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,900
Yul Hee just came by

373
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,800
and asked about your disciplinary action.

374
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,770
<i>This isn't a request from some commoner,</i>

375
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,870
so I can't keep pretending
I don't know about it, can I?

376
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,170
Let's talk more at school tomorrow.

377
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,770
I also have something urgent to discuss with you.

378
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,030
The moment the media finds out

379
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,930
Kim Hae In's incident was an attempted murder
and not a suicide, they'll go into a frenzy.

380
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,170
Wouldn't your position as
chairman be in jeopardy too?

381
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,200
So,

382
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,410
if I accept this?

383
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,830
Then my friends and I will graduate
quietly as if nothing happened,

384
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,900
and Hanmyeong will continue
to be your biggest sponsor.

385
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,700
Of course,

386
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,200
your position as chairman will remain unchanged.

387
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,400
Then I'll take that as your
acceptance and be on my way.

388
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,030
I'll leave this as a sign of trust.

389
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,470
When did you say

390
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,070
the Oh Si Eun case would be closed?

391
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,370
The investigation will be
concluded within this week.

392
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,530
What's the scenario?

393
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,970
<i>Hospital records show that student Oh Si Eun</i>

394
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,730
had been suffering from depression

395
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,730
and showed signs of suicide,
such as overdosing on tranquilizers.

396
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,670
<i>In particular, the bereaved family
does not want things to get noisy</i>

397
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,870
and has requested the case be closed quietly.

398
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,330
Wrap it up that way.

399
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,530
And erase all of Kim Hye In's
investigation records.

400
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,600
<i>Yes, I will handle it as soon as possible.</i>

401
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,270
Hello.

402
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,470
It's been a while, brothers and sisters.

403
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,500
Lee Sa Rang?

404
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,730
The youngest of Diamond 6!

405
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,730
It's Sa Rang.

406
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,570
So, you're the new member from the first years.

407
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,270
If everyone's here, let's just say what
we have to say and get this over with.

408
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,170
You must all be uncomfortable
being in the same space.

409
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,200
You're here early.

410
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,430
You've never seen me before, right?

411
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,070
My name is Cha Jin Wook,

412
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,430
a transfer student.

413
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,100
And

414
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,530
the new member of this club.

415
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,800
It's a pleasure.

416
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,070
Hey, Baek Jenna,

417
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,470
isn't it proper manners to tell us first

418
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,000
when you're recommending a new member?

419
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,900
There is a spot left by Lee Deok Min.

420
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,470
And I'm telling you just in case,

421
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,830
but I meet the basic requirements to join,

422
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,900
so you don't need to worry.

423
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,830
And

424
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,600
there will be one more new member coming.

425
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,570
What are you talking about?
There are no vacancies.

426
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,500
What are you doing, Baek Jenna?

427
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,230
One of the conditions for joining the Diamond 6

428
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,270
is a top-tier donation.

429
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,030
But isn't there someone among us

430
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,970
who hasn't paid the donation?

431
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,400
Seo Do Un.

432
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm sorry,

433
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,670
but you'll have to leave.

434
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,470
What are you doing?

435
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,940
The new member of Diamond 6...

436
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,270
is Kim Hye In.
