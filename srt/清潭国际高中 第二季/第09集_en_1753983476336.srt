My son!

185
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,430
Do Un, why did you come here?

186
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,200
It's my first time seeing you since dropping out.

187
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,600
It's obvious what Hee Kwon's up to.
You must be having a hard time too.

189
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,800
It's okay.

190
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,370
I can handle it.

191
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,530
Don't ever back down.

192
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,070
Your future lies with Cheongjae Foundation.

193
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,170
If we let Hee Kwon play his games,

194
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,700
our foundation will be in danger.

195
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,570
I might not seem important now,

196
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,130
but I'll get my position soon.

197
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,270
But have you been

198
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,600
just fishing here, like this?

199
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,770
I don't know how to do it.

200
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,630
I'm just killing time.

201
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,330
Everything else is boring.

202
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,370
Someday the time will come.

203
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,570
Actually, that's why I came.

204
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,800
You definitely

205
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,130
need to do something for me.

It's the weekend but you're working hard.

208
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,830
You're cold, aren't you?

209
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,870
No, not at all.

210
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,530
Let's get in the car, it's cold.

211
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,370
Let's get in the car.

212
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,930
The coffee is good.

213
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,270
It's tasty, right?

214
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,430

Don't you?

Is it because you're pretty?
Or because you're kind?

Dad,

219
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,270

220
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,370
What about you?

221
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,030
Even if I disappoint you,

222
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,970
will you still

223
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,870
take my side unconditionally?

224
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,470
No matter

225
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,970
where you go or what you do,

226
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,070
no matter what you did,

231
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,130
congratulations!

232
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,500
From the bottom of my heart.

233
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,900
Wow!

234
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,430
My daughter looks exceptionally pretty today.

235
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,630
Jenna, you should accept the flowers.

236
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,870
You're all grown up now.

237
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,000
Remember this,

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,530
today is meaningful for you,

239

Remember that.

Yes, Dad.

244
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,400
Don't worry.

245
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
Shall we go find our seats?

246
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,930
You go first.

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,230
I need to talk with my stepmom.

how dare you try to bring

Should I call this bold

256
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,370
or reckless?

257
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,330
Jenna,

258
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,500
I was wrong.

259
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
'Wrong' is an understatement

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,730
Oh, no need to thank me. I am the grateful one

371
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,170
for having a treasure like Jenna in our family.

372
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,000
Thank you!

373
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,430
As with family matters,

374
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,130
I believe we'll collaborate well in business too.

375
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,330
Of course, naturally!

376
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,930
Madam, you're truly radiant.

377
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,200
Thank you.

378
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,430
- Please, sit down.
- Yes.

379
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,370
- Hello, Chairman.
- Gods, Madam.

380
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,270
This is Madam Ahn Yoo Jin from Minje Daily.

381
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,400
This is Chairman Cha Ki Ho of Chasel Medic.

382
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,770
This is my wife.

383
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,270
Pleasure to meet you. I'm
Ahn Yoo Jin from Minje Daily.

384
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,730
Yes, nice to meet you.

385
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,730
Chasel is a major sponsor of Minje Daily, right?

386
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,070
Correct. Let's continue working together!

387
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,100
Of course!

388
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,270
By the way, Madam,

389
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,170
how are you so elegant?

390
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,730
Thank you.

391
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,370
Nice to meet you.

392
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,730
I'm Ha Min Hee.

393
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,170
You're here, Chairman?

394
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,670
Mr. Chairman, you're here.

395
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,470
Please take your seat.

396
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,870
- Please sit.
- Yes.

397
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,930
Allow me to announce

398
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,100
the ceremony will begin shortly.

399
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,570
Please, return to your seats.

400
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,530
Yes, despite your busy schedules,

401
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,730
we express our gratitude to all of you

402
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,970
who took precious time to celebrate

403
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,200
the beautiful engagement of the two.

404
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,630
Today is not merely a day...

405
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,830
What is this?

406
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,900
When two people promise their future together,

407
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,200
but also a meaningful occasion

408
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,730
where two families unite as one.

409
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,570
Yes, the protagonists are none other than

410
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,530
Hanmyeong Group's Baek Jenna
and Chasel Medic's Cha Jin Wook.

411
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,970
Please welcome them with a big applause.

412
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,530
Yes, the two are so beautiful and splendid,

413
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,930
making their entrance together now.

414
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,200
Let's have another round of enthusiastic applause!

415
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,670
Now, we shall formally

416
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,330
commence the engagement ceremony.

417
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,970
First, we'll hear congratulatory remarks,

418
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,100
expressing hopes for the couple's shared future.

419
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,430
Through Hanmyeong Scholarship
Foundation's Equal Opportunity System,

420
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,970
she entered Cheongdam International High School.

421
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,930
Baek Jenna's friend,

422
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,670
- Friend?
- Student Kim Hye In.

423
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,930
- This is bullshit.
- Please give her a big applause.

424
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,230
Hello everyone.

425
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,930
I'm here to celebrate my friends' engagement

426
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,670
as student representative
of Cheongdam International High School.

427
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,100
I transferred to this school

428
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,430
through the Equal Opportunity System.

429
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,670
Hey!

430
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,100
Hey, Seo Hee Su!

431
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,030
Seo Hee Su!

432
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,430
What's happening?

433
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,230
Haven't seen you in ages. Can't you calm down?

434
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,070
Even if we cut ties...

435
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,630
Ah, darn it!

436
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,830
What the hell!

437
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,670
They'll hear everything.

438
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,970
Let's talk somewhere else.

439
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,430
Darn it.

440
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,130
I said let's go talk elsewhere!

441
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,430
The truth is,

442
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,930
as a transfer student from a regular school,

443
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,730
the reason I could enter
Cheongdam International High School

444
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,770
is because Kim Hae In,

445
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,030
the original Equal Opportunity student

446
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,130
who tried to commit suicide
jumping from the rooftop.

447
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,800
But on that day,

448
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,730
when Kim Hae In fell from the roof,

449
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,070
I was also present.

450
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,830
And at that moment,

451
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,030
I saw the person who pushed Kim Hae In.

452
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,170
I was allowed

453
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,130
to enter this school under the condition

454
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,570
that I stay silent about
the culprit who pushed her.

455
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,570
And within Cheongdam International High School's

456
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,130
Diamond 6,

457
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,430
there is a murderer

458
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,730
who tried to kill Kim Hae In by pushing her.

459
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,770
The culprit who pushed
Kim Hae In is present today!

460
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,630
That criminal is none other than

461
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,130
a member of Diamond 6...
