00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,530
[Secret of Cheongdam International High School:
Culprit of the Fall Incident Is in Diamond 6]

187
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,870
Is there a murderer in Diamond 6?

188
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,600
Are they talking about Kim Hae In? Or Oh Si Eun?

189
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,270
Or both?

190
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,550
Now that I think about it, it was weird.

191
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,100
Both cases were quickly wrapped up as suicides.

192
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,670
Do you know who the culprit is?

193
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,970
Don't tell me...

194
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,430
Was it the Leech?

195
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,000
<i>Yesterday, Black Dog</i>

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,470
<i>sent me a text.</i>

197
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>Be at the underground practice building by 9 pm.</i>

198
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,100
Ah, seriously!

199
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,170
What are you doing now?

200
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,800
Does it make sense that you still
can't even track that bastard's outline?

201
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,830
What about the police?

202
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,100
They said tracking is difficult
because it's a foreign IP.

203
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,600
Who doesn't know that?

204
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,500
There's no time.

205
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,330
If we can't catch them,

206
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,900
then create something to solve it.

207
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,400
Hey!

208
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
You crazy punk!

209
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,990
You got that video
from Park Woo Jin, right?

210
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,230
Hand over Oh Si Eun's phone.

211
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh, who is this?

212
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,330
Aren't you Black Dog?

213
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,700
Black Dog?

214
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,970
What kind of nonsense is this?

215
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,130
You would know better than me.

216
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,200
The footage came out pretty clear.

217
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,030
Should I show it?

218
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,300
What is this?

219
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,000
Why would I be Black Dog?

220
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,340
Even if you say it's not you,

221
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,970
if I give this to Mr. Chairman,

222
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,400
what do you think will happen?

223
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,370
Black Dog summoned Park Woo Jin.

224
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,270
Black Dog appeared there.

225
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,500
Enough.

226
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,470
Where's Oh Si Eun's phone?

227
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,000
Where did you hide Oh Si Eun's phone?

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,370
Talk! I said talk!

229
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,470
Where is it? I'm asking where it is!

230
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,270
Have you thought about what to do from now on?

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,570
Do I have to spell everything out for you?

232
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,570
You...

233
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,600
I'll expose everything.

234
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,330
Then, you'll be done too.

235
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,400
It's been spread around that
there's a murderer in Diamond 6.

236
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Do you think you'll be okay?

237
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,730
Kim Hye In, you're surprisingly
stupider than I thought.

238
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,730
That kind of thing can't send everyone away.

239
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,270
Framing you would be easy.

240
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,300
So,

241
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,630
here.

242
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,130
During Baek Jenna's engagement ceremony,

243
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,500
testify that the murderer who
pushed Kim Hae In was Baek Jenna.

244
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,900
What did you say?

245
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,600
Otherwise, I'll send your video to your dad

246
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,630
and the CCTV footage to Mr. Chairman.

247
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,500
Pretty neat, huh?

248
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,300
Well, in the end, both will
spread all over the world anyway.

249
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,730
Snap out of it!

250
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,430
We don't have much time,
so you'd better decide quickly.

251
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,330
This got dirty.

252
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,970
If you want it, take it yourself.

253
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,730
Min Yul Hee

254
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,870
has my video.

255
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,370
And the proof that I'm Black Dog.

256
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,630
What?

257
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,530
What do you mean by that?

258
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,100
The day we tried to summon Park Woo Jin,

259
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,070
Min Yul Hee found out about
it and took the CCTV video.

260
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,300
She said she'd take that to Mr. Chairman,

261
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,770
claiming that the Black Dog
Mr. Chairman is looking for

262
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,830
is actually me.

263
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,870
Why is everyone really acting like this?

264
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,530
Min Yul Hee wants to drag Baek Jenna
down to hell until the end.

265
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,170
The same goes for me.

266
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Making a poor secretary
into a criminal with a record,

267
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,600
you managed to escape somehow,

268
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,730
Baek Jenna.

269
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,100
It was Ha Min Hee's doing, not mine.

270
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,270
And you too.

271
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,870
You're about to cause a big stir.

272
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,300
Why are you dragging me into this?

273
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,600
You did it all.

274
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,430
Me?

275
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,130
I'm a very busy person.

276
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,670
The fact that there's a murderer in Diamond 6

277
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,430
is already known by everyone.

278
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,270
It must be unsettling.

279
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,200
Min Yul Hee?

280
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,030
What?

281
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,370
Am I the only one in Diamond 6?

282
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,570
And the person who hated Kim Hae In to death

283
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,230
was you, not me.

284
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,530
Why are you so desperate?

285
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,030
The reason you became like this
is because of that trash Park Woo Jin.

286
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,200
It wasn't because of me.

287
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,330
You're the one...

288
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,030
who is disgusting, Baek Jenna.

289
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,170
People tolerated you only
because you're part of Hanmyeong.

290
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,530
Do you think anyone actually
treated you as a person?

291
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,100
Behind your back, everyone insults and mocks you.

292
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,030
I pitied your miserable life so much

293
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,370
that I endured everything while being your friend.

294
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,170
But what did you do to me?

295
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,000
You're truly pitiful.

296
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,730
Everything you're doing,

297
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,900
it's self-deprecation.

298
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,130
Hey...

299
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,300
You're really done for now.

300
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,830
I'll throw you into a pit
you can't escape from twice.

301
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,630
Because I'll shove you in myself.

302
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,900
[Min Yul Hee]
<i>Hurry up and decide.</i>

303
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,600
<i>Before I kill your father too.</i>

304
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Min Yul Hee, you're insane!

305
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,870
Why did you tell me?

306
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,100
I know you're not on my side,

307
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,930
but what's your goal?

308
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,730
What if I know?

309
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,400
I got fooled until now because I didn't know.

310
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,600
But I won't be a stupid pawn
on your chessboard anymore.

311
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,170
Jenna,

312
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,930
don't make me...

313
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,570
overturn the whole game because of you.

314
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,670
I was worried,

315
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,530
but nothing happened, right?

316
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,100
Since when do you worry about me?

317
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,730
Exactly.

318
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,530
Hey,

319
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,370
I was...

320
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,270
I was just...

321
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,070
Hey.

322
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,100
What? What now?

323
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,900
Say something.

324
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,870
I think...

325
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,270
maybe staying in Diamond 6 isn't right.

326
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,100
Suddenly?

327
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,770
I've cleared the suspicions

328
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,270
and I can study on my own now.

329
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,070
What?

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
I'll miss the bus.

331
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
I'll go ahead.

332
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,500
Hey!

333
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,330
I'll take you home.

334
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,930
No, it's fine.

335
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,800
I'll get going now.

336
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,470
What was that?

337
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,770
[Do Un]

338
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,000
<i>Hae In.</i>

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,900
Yeah?

340
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,970
<i>I'm thinking of studying abroad.</i>

341
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,930
- Abroad?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

342
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,770
<i>I'm sick of this place.
I looked into some new schools.</i>

343
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,570
<i>Do you want to go together?</i>

344
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,530
- With you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

345
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,300
<i>It's a boarding high school in Malaysia.
An international school.</i>

346
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,370
<i>Of course, it's nothing compared to here.</i>

347
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,370
<i>But I think my mind would be very at ease.</i>

348
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,900
<i>Let's go together.</i>

349
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,070
You can become a scholarship student
recommended by our foundation.

350
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,830
You tried to use me, right?

351
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,200
Use me again.

352
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,970
<i>This is a chance to escape from here.</i>

353
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,530
Thanks, Do Un.

354
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,700
<i>Do I have to decide now?</i>

355
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,730
No.

356
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,130
Then, shall we meet tomorrow and talk again?

357
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,700
Yeah, let's do that.

358
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,100
Okay.

359
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,050
Hey, you wretch! Come with me.

360
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,000
My engagement with Min Yul Hee was canceled.

361
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,730
Ah, you wretch!

362
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,600
Did you get what you wanted?

363
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,030
What does that have to do with me?

364
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,230
Why are you involved with me and causing this?
Darn it! What is going on?

365
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,970
Move.

366
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,870
Before I call the police.

367
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,500
Call the police. Where's your phone?

368
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Call them! Call the police, you wretch!

369
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,770
Do you think I'll listen to your crap?

370
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm the one who's messed up after
being involved with you!

371
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,330
I'll report that I was recorded
and blackmailed, you wretch!

372
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,130
What nonsense is this, seriously.

373
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,820
Nonsense?

374
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,500
But this slutty wretch, really...

375
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,570
What?

376
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,210
Slut?

377
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,430
Hey, watch your mouth!

378
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,670
You're the slut messing around with every girl!

379
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,000
Why do you always act crazy toward me?

380
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,300
Maniac, have you lost your mind?

381
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,400
Are you really going nuts because
I'm the one dealing with you?

382
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,030
Let go! You crazy bastard!

383
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,870
Did you stuff a rag in your mouth?

384
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,730
Hey, I'll report you to the police.

385
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,100
You wretch!

386
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Get lost, you crazy wretch!

387
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,900
I'm sorry.

388
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,830
Darn it!

389
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,000
I...

390
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,470
Because of you...

391
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,230
Do you know what I've been through?

392
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,270
Hey!

393
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,930
Look at yourself!

394
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,170
You worthless shit. What you get for acting up!

395
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,600
Hey.

396
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,100
Live like this for the rest of your life, okay?

397
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Do you understand?

398
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,270
Huh? You crazy girl.

399
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,300
You're really such a dog-like slut.

400
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,670
Hey, Kim Hae In!

401
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,200
You...

402
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,500
Who hurt you like this?

403
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,030
Hey!

404
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,770
Let me be honest with you,

405
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,770
I want to end everything.

406
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,770
But,

407
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,170
Min Yul Hee

408
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,990
and Park Woo Jin

409
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,630
need to pay for their crimes.

410
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,500
You...

411
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,400
So,

412
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,170
Hye In,

413
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,570
just once,

414
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,330
please,

415
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,490
help me.

416
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,680
Please?

417
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,330
The necklace

418
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,370
is with you, right?

419
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,430
Ah, that...

420
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,670
You're the only witness.

421
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,500
Huh?

422
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,310
Ah, that...

423
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,170
Look.

424
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,770
No, hey.

425
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,170
- No.
- Hye In,

426
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,000
I won't do anything.

427
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,530
Just help me this one time, really.

428
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,670
I'm sorry.

429
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,670
I'm really, really sorry.

430
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,830
I was wrong all this time, I'm sorry.

431
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,130
- I'm sorry.
- That's not it, Hae In.

432
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,000
That...

433
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,570
That... the necklace

434
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,870
is not with me.

435
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
What?

436
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,970
That necklace

437
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,170
isn't with me.

438
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,830
Then,

439
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,330
have you been lying

440
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,630
to me all this time?

441
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,700
I...

442
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,430
trusted you

443
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,830
all this time.

444
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,330
I will

445
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,800
try to find another way somehow, Hae In.

446
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,730
I'm so sorry.

447
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,030
I tried to find a way too,

448
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,200
but now even my dad is in danger.

449
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,100
Hae In.

450
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,470
Right.

451
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,070
I should've realized it back then.

452
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,300
When I nearly fell off the rooftop
and died, you pretended not to know.

453
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,330
I was out of my mind to trust you.

454
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,770
Kim Hye In,

455
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,170
you'll only speak the truth from now on.

456
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I hope you remember this

457
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,000
for the rest of your life.

458
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,350
What?

459
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,970
Hae In.
