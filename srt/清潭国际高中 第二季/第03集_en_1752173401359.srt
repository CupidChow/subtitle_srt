[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:21,667
The new member of Diamond 6, Kim Hye In.

3
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,933
So you want to kick Do Un out and put Kim Hye In

4
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,800
in his place?

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,300
Hey, according to whose will?

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,133
Hey, Baek Jenna,

7
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,333
what did you just say?

8
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,633
I'm sorry,

9
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:01,867
but you'll have to leave.

10
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:04,267
No, I mean

11
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,967
you're saying you decided this on your own?

12
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,067
It's not as I please.

13
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,267
I'm just following the rules.

14
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,633
It's not the first time
we clean up like this, is it?

15
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,400
Hey, no matter what,

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,900
is Seo Do Un the same as Oh Si Eun?

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,333
Hey, Park Woo Jin,

18
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,300
will you stay quiet?

19
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,400
For a commoner who barely got in here with money.

20
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,367
Wow! Darn it!

21
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,367
Say that again.

22
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:42,133
I'm going to confirm directly with the chairman.

23
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,700
Oh, Do Un,

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,167
I was on my way to see you.

25
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:59,167
Being expelled from Diamond 6

26
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,267
was your decision?

27
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,000
I was going to explain it myself.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,033
Yes,

29
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:09,467
I understand you're feeling disappointed, Do Un.

30
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,267
Without the donation and the chairman's approval,

31
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:16,367
the reason you were able
to become a member of Diamond 6

32
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,933
was because you were the heir
to the school foundation.

33
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,633
This happened because of your father's mistake.

34
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,700
I just restored it to normal.

35
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,667
Well, the person who said he would protect me…

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
Wasn't it enough

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,433
to push my father out?

38
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,867
Push out, you say?

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,633
The former chairman

40
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,700
was dismissed due to his own mistakes.

41
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,467
Besides,

42
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:55,267
in a public place like the school,

43
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,533
don't act childish.

44
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,900
Rules?

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,533
Then, what about the donation?

46
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,133
There's no way she could have given
a donation at Diamond 6's level.

47
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,567
Don't worry.

48
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,100
Because the money has been paid.

49
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
Hey, gosh!

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,300
So, where did an Equal Opportunity Leech
like her get such money?

51
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,133
Woo Jin!

52
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,200
She's a Diamond 6 now,
not an Equal Opportunity Leech.

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,967
I lent it to her.

54
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,700
Much more than what you paid.

55
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,033
Baek Jenna…

56
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,633
So, you do that kind of thing now too?

57
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,767
That kind of thing?

58
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,400
Hey, don't you get it?

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,033
If it weren't Seo Do Un, it would have been you.

60
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,467
Exactly!

61
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:54,400
You're one to talk, your own situation

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
must be a mess right now.

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,067
Watch your words, everyone.

64
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,267
Stop being so vulgar.

65
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,567
Everyone,

66
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,500
do you like the new lounge?

67
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,833
Chairman,

68
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,333
this is not something Baek Jenna can handle alone…

69
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,000
Today, I was actually planning

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,433
to congratulate our student, Kim Hye In.

71
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,367
Has everyone finished greeting each other?

72
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,567
Get along well, everyone.

73
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:34,000
Check if there's anything else needed here.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,967
Yes, understood.

75
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,800
Then…

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,100
This is intense for the first day.

77
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,667
Did you get home safely yesterday?

78
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,800
The school is quite large.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,467
Can I ask for some guidance?

80
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,533
I don't usually comply with others' requests.

81
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,067
Really?

82
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,800
But aren't we more than strangers?

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,933
We're engaged, aren't we?

84
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,933
Being involved with you

85
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,900
is quite unpleasant for me.

86
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,000
So, don't go around blabbing

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,367
about the engagement and all that.

88
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,800
Alright,

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,767

and the school violence committee

will all be erased.

106
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,300
As a member of Diamond 6,

107
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,867
you need to take responsibility accordingly.

108
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,400

if someone doesn't notice
you've changed your hairstyle,

with other girls, don't you?

What? What are you talking
about? Misunderstanding?

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't misunderstand things like that.

00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,233
Hey, your hair…

192
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,467
What's the concept?

193
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,667
Mind your own business.

194
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,867
Alright, quiet, everyone!

195
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,267
Hye In? You're going to go up, right?

196
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,967
Ah, yes.

197
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,267
Look at that hair! From what I see…

198
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,567
- Somewhere…
- You all received this, right?

199
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,800
Excuse me…

200
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,100
Who was that just now?

201
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,900
She was from our school?

202
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,667
Oh, she's Hye In, with a 'ye'.

203
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,033
She transferred right after your accident.

204
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:05,267
Right after my accident?

205
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,200
Because your seat was empty.

206
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
She came in under the Equal Opportunity
Program and became famous

207
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,067
as a troublemaker in this school.

208
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,067
Everyone,

209
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:27,100
applying to the Ivy League is not just
about getting into a good university.

210
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,000
It's about proving your potential

211
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,833
and vision to the world.

212
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,533
[University Entrance Presentation]
If you look at the first page,

213
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:36,800
for students who find the next
year a bit burdensome,

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,233
in the current year…

215
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,000
The blue file.

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,167
Is that Equal Opportunity Leech a Diamond 6?

217
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:27,667
Hello?

218
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,967
<i>This is Choi Woo Hyuk from Gangnam police station.</i>

219
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,433
<i>The case of student Oh Si Eun</i>

220
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,133
<i>has been concluded as a suicide.</i>

221
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,967
What?

222
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,467
Then…

223
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,500
<i>The witness investigation has also concluded.</i>

224
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
<i>You can now focus on your academic life.</i>

225
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,867
Okay, thank you.

226
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,067
I've been cleared, and
the witness investigation is over.

227
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,167
Ah, well…

228
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,600
Oh Si Eun's case

229
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,700
was concluded as a suicide.

230
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,733
That's good.

231
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,867
Congratulations.

232
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:10,567
I wonder if this is something
to be congratulated on, though.

233
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,767
Oh Si Eun, really…

234
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,567
Really what?

235
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,567
Never mind.

236
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,433
Hey, don't dodge.

237
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:28,367
Look. Look here.

238
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,400
Look! I said look, you dummy!

239
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:36,733
Darn it, don't dodge.

240
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,800
It spilled it all.

241
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,233
Gosh! Are you crazy?

242
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,067
Wipe it.

243
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,800
My shoes.

244
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,500
I spilled it because of you. So, wipe it off.

245
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,200
Have you really gone mad?

246
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,033
If you're confident, try hitting me.

247
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,133
Let go.

248
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,433
- Badge! Badge!
- What badge, moron?

249
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,533
The Diamond 6 badge.

250
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,367
You can't hit me, can you?

251
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,233
Since when

252
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,233
did you talk back

253
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,300
to Diamond 6?

254
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,167
In this school?

255
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,167
Should I say it again?

256
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,367
I told you to clean it!

257
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,633
You really came back here?

258
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,233
Huh?

259
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,467
Darn it!

260
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,633
Hey!

261
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:17,067
Amnesia?

262
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,333
Who would believe that?

263
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,533
Are you kidding me?

264
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,133
Sorry,

265
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,900
but I really don't remember.

266
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,167
Do you know that?

267
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,867
The first time is hard.

268
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:35,200
The second time is nothing.

269
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:40,633
Whether it's a show or not, I don't care.

270
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,733
Leave this school within a week.

271
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,533
Got it?

272
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,367
If not,

273
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,000
every day will be

274
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,200
a living hell.

275
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,667
Just one week.

276
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:56,633
When I'm letting you walk out of
here alive on your own two feet,

277
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,433
just leave quietly.

278
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,267
Got it?

279
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm asking if you understood, you scum.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Got it?

281
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,333
What are you doing?

282
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,367
If you're looking for a sex
partner, there's no need for it.

283
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:34,467
Should I call Kim Hae In?

284
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,233
Gosh, why are you like this?

285
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,167
I was trying to forget and move on,

286
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,533
but Kim Hae In suddenly appeared in front of me.

287
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,367
Because she keeps coming
and going, in front of my eyes,

288
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,267
I can imagine you guys together.

289
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,067
Yul Hee,

290
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:53,900
back then, I…

291
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,167
You know I'm really only thinking about you.

292
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,767
Why are you like this?

293
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,567
Oh, come on!

294
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,833
Park Woo Jin,

295
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,600
as your fiancée, this is

296
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,267
your last opportunity.

297
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:13,000
If my name gets tarnished again because of you,

298
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,967
we're done.

299
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:22,467
Gosh! Really!

300
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,567
Jeez, she went out.

301
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,800
Did you get your revenge properly?

302
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,533
It's not revenge.

303
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,367
It's punishment.

304
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:49,567
Don't you know what he did to me?

305
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,667
What?

306
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,100
Kim Hae In?

307
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,433
Yeah, Kim Hae In.

308
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,133
She has amnesia.

309
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,567
She came back from the dead and lost her memory.

310
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,467
Kim Hae In

311
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:12,033
lost her memory?

312
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,800
Let's go.

313
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,867
There's a place we need to go together.

314
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,500
Together?

315
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,800
Everyone

316
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,767
seems to hate me.

317
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,400
No,

318
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,833
after some time,

319
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,500
they will go back to normal.

320
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:53,733
Not remembering anything

321
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,533
makes me feel awful.

322
00:24:56,533 --> 00:25:00,867
I don't even remember

323
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,600
that you were my boyfriend.

324
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,433
Sorry.

325
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,133
It's okay if you don't remember.

326
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,367
Just the fact that you're alive

327
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:16,600
is a great relief.

328
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,633
From now, future is important,

329
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,500
and we can do it together,

330
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,667
one step at a time.

331
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,667
Feel free to look around.

332
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:42,367
Pick something you like.

333
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,400
Let me see your taste.

334
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,300
8.6 million won?

335
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,067
You guys come to places like this

336
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:02,533
like you're just popping into a convenience store.

337
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
It doesn't suit you.

338
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,667
Don't look at the price. Just see if it suits you.

339
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,300
Does this color look good on you?

340
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,567
I was just touching it.

341
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,833
Don't think about the price.

342
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,167
Choose freely.

343
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,167
Really?

344
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,700
I tried it on,

345
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,100
but I'll put it back.

346
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,933
Hey!

347
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,933
Are you using your card today?

348
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:50,933
What?

349
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:54,500
You should start dressing to match Diamond 6.

350
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,967
<i>The life of Baek Jenna that I experienced today,</i>

351
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,567
<i>even while being in the middle of it,</i>

352
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,567
<i>felt</i>

353
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,667
<i>just like a dream.</i>

354
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,267
The gun is a bit weird.

355
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,733
Oh…

356
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,300
Oh!

357
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,167
Nice posture.

358
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,800
He just tried a few.

359
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,833
It's just a coincidence.

360
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,633
Yeah.

361
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:44,600
Another coincidence?

362
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,133
Coincidence.

363
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,900
I didn't know until I came here,

364
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,333
but this school is quite noisy.

365
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,567
Not these days.

366
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,800
This school is originally noisy and famous.

367
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,233
No.

368
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,867
Within six months, two
people fell to their deaths,

369
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,033
both at the same spot.

370
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,400
Ah.

371
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,067
One didn't die and came back to life?

372
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,433
Anyway, what's the reason?

373
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:15,200
Well, you'd know if you've heard the rumors.

374
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,500
Both are said to be suicides.

375
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,333
Don't you watch the news?

376
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,533
Why is everyone like this?

377
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,033
It's what's in the news,

378
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,167
all reported from the parents'
company headquarters.

379
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,733
It's a plausible copy-paste explanation.

380
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm just curious.

381
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,633
They both died at the same spot.

382
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,500
Isn't it strange?

383
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,733
Wasn't someone pushed them?

384
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,467
That's ridiculous.

385
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:44,367
If so, what would be the reason?

386
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,167
Reason for killing…

387
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,000
No.

388
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:53,533
Reason for wanting to kill.

389
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,500
What the hell?

390
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,467
Was it only that?

391
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,467
Hey, Cha Jin Wook,

392
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,467
are you an illegitimate child?

393
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:39,067
Well, are you an illegitimate child?

394
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:42,267
Yes.

395
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,267
I'm an illegitimate child.

396
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:48,133
Why?

397
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,733
Woo Jin,

398
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,867
pulling this trigger isn't about finger strength,

399
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,367
it's human willpower.

400
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:01,800
Ah, this guy moves his hand at me
even though he's just a bastard.

401
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,633
Woo Jin!

402
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,933
Let go!

403
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,067
Yeah.

404
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:14,000
It must have been hard for you to deceive us, too.

405
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
Deceive?

406
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,533
Me?

407
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,367
When?

408
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:29,733
But, Woo Jin,

409
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,733
even if I'm a bastard,

410
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,967
do you dare to lift your head at me?

411
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,367
Right?

412
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:58,933
You and I aren't on the same level, are we?

413
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,033
Eat these two.

414
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,400
You bastard kid.

415
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,267
I'm going.

416
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,067
Hi!

417
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,633
Ah.

418
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,533
Hi!

419
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,800
Our names are really similar.

420
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,033
Ah.

421
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:53,567
Oh, they are.

422
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:57,333
I heard you came in through the same system as me.

423
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,800
How did you become a Diamond 6?

424
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,067
That's impressive.

425
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,000
Ah…

426
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:05,900
I got some help.

427
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,500
It's not that impressive.

428
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,700
Since you came in through the same system,

429
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,667
I thought we could become friends.

430
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:33,567
Ah!

431
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,033
Are you keeping what I gave you well?

432
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:41,633
What?

433
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,800
Don't you remember?

434
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,967
The necklace I gave you.

435
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,533
<i>Kim Hae In</i>

436
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:15,000
<i>remembers everything.</i>
