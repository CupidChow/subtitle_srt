[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,630
Let me introduce you

3
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,630
my fiancÃ©,

4
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,270
Cha Jin Wook.

5
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,530
That's right.

6
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,630
We're engaged.

7
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
Don't be mistaken.

8
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,230
What, Baek Jenna?

9
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,300
You put the Equal Opportunity Leech in Diamond 6,

10
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,500
and now you're even engaged
to an illegitimate child?

11
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,030
How did you end up like this, Baek Jenna?

12
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,630
I don't think this is the time
for you to worry about me.

13
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,330
But, Yul Hee,

14
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,270
you need to develop better taste.

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,200
Your eye for dresses is really

16
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,000
quite poor.

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,870
Hey, don't take pictures!

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,370
I told you to stop!

19
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,630
Hey!

20
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,900
You humiliate me like this
and think you can just leave?

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,830
You crazy girl!

22
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,230
This is your place now,

23
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,030
Min Yul Hee.

24
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,630
This...

25
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,700
Let go.!

26
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Hey, Baek Jenna.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,700
Hey!

28
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,900
You!

29
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,800
Hey!

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
Why do you keep showing up everywhere

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,130
to ruin my life?

32
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,170
Did you feel good wearing that
pretty dress? Did you have fun?

33
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,370
Enjoyed playing dress-up?

34
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,930
- Take this off!
- Yul Hee!

35
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,070
How dare you touch someone like her!

36
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,830
Yeah, this is better.

37
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,030
How is it?

38
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,800
Do you like it?

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,030
This is what you should wear.

40
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,730
Who do you think you are to wear such clothes?

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,230
Doesn't this look more like you?

42
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,830
What?

43
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,970
What?

44
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,730
You crazy bitch!

45
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,100
This insane scum!

46
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,100
Hye In!

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,830
Hye In!

48
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,400
Please, don't follow me.

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,530
I'm begging you.

50
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,270
I won't follow you, just wear this and leave.

51
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,930
On that day, I came to realize

52
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,270
that to Baek Jenna,

53
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,300
I was nothing more than a tool.

54
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,530
Like a piece on a chessboard,

55
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,500
being to be used only when needed

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,870
and then discarded.

57
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,330
Was today's incident all planned?

58
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,830
What sudden change of heart is this?

59
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,770
You're right.

60
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,200
Since I stand on the chessboard,

61
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,830
I must place my own pieces.

62
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,100
Clever of you.

63
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,000
I have no intention of losing my spot

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,700
as the heir to Hanmyeong Group

65
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,070
or my position as queen of the Diamond 6.

66
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,670
You'll probably

67
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,800
beat your elder brothers
and become the heir yourself.

68
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You know everything.

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,670
But for some reason,

70
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,570
I feel like that's not the whole story.

71
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,270
The Cha Jin Wook I've observed these days

72
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,100
doesn't seem interested
in things like being the heir.

73
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,770
What is

74
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,000
your real motive?

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,070
There's none.

76
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,530
I'm just an ordinary person

77
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,530
striving to achieve what I want.

78
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,830
You? Ordinary?

79
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,530
Anyway,

80
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
let's cooperate

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,370
until we no longer need each other.

82
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,400
Fine, let's do that.

83
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,070
[Cheongdam International High School]

84
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,300
What?

85
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,600
[Cheongdam High's Min Yul Hee
got covered in dirt and humiliated]

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,470
Crazy!

87
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,730
She's insane.

88

[Cha Jin Wook, third son of Chasel Medic, engaged
to Hanmyeong Group's daughter Baek Jenna]

89
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,330
Cha Jin Wook's truly legendary.

90
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,400
With Baek Jenna?

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,530
[If Cha Jin Wook becomes engaged to Baek Jenna,
his standing on succession is expected to change]

92
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,230
[Cha Jin Wook emerges as Chasel Medic's heir]

93
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,200
Cha Jin Wook?

94

[Min Yul Hee]

95
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,170
She needs to know her place.

96
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,900
Where is that Leech going?

97
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,200
Learn where you belong.

98
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,730
Looking forward to it.

99
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,600
After Baek Jenna, you're next.

100
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,330
You never drank decaf before.

101
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,800
Oh, really?

102
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,370
I was told to be careful with caffeine,

103
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,270
Do Un,

104
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,000
can't I visit the Diamond 6 Lounge?

105
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,770
Not just anyone can go in there.

106
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,630
Besides...

107
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm not in the Diamond 6 anymore.

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,900
Really?

109
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,130
But none of that matters now.

110
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,730
I like being here with you more.

111
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,670
Since when?

112
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,330
Why are you only telling me now?

113
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,630
No, it's just...

114
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,300
it's not a big deal.

115
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,870
This isn't 'a big deal'?

116
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,770
A few days ago, Park Woo Jin...

117
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,630
Park Woo Jin?

118
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,500
Do you know him?

119
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,200
You don't, right?

120
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
When did you guys talk?

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,370
Is that what's important right now?

122
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,770
Then what's important? Huh?

123
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,530
Ah, then what's important?

124
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,500
Hye In, did you get home safely yesterday?

125
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,900
Seriously. Why are people so mean?

126
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's stop talking about that.

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,830
Okay.

128
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,870
But,

129
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,300
Cha Jin Wook and Baek Jenna's
engagement is causing a stir.

130
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,800
They said they had a formal family meeting
as soon as he returned to Korea.

131
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,030
Did you know? About Baek Jenna
and Cha Jin Wook's engagement?

132
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,370
Of course.

133
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,830
There's nothing I don't know.

134
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,730
Then, do you

135
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,800
know Oh Si Eun too?

136
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,970
Oh Si Eun?

137
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,970
Of course.

138
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,800
You know, JLK's granddaughter who had an accident.

139
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,370
Accident?

140
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,900
It was a suicide.

141
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,000
Why do you call it an accident?

142
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,270
Ah, right.

143
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,670
Ah, I got confused.

144
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,070
Then, do you

145
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,200
know Oh Si Eun's phone disappeared too?

146
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,730
Phone?

147
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,630
Why does that matter?

148
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,830
Are you hiding something from me?

149
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,670
No.

150
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,330
What's wrong with you?

151
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,770
I knew this would happen.

152
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,370
What is it? Why have you been acting
this way towards me all this time?

153
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,130
Well, it's just...

154
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,170
I want to see you more often.

155
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,970
Huh?

156
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,530
Ah...

157
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,200
I really didn't want to say this.

158
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Oh! My favorite sausage.

159
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Hm, delicious.

160
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,670
Excuse me.

161
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,870
I just like spicy pork.

162
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,170
Why aren't you eating?

163
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,570
You have an appetite right now?

164
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,700
You're leaving this?

165
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,170
It's been a while, Ms. Ha Min Hee.

166
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,600
No.

167
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,100
Hanmyeong Group Madam?

168
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,330
It's been a while, Yul Hee.

169
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,000
Since you're welcoming me like this,

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,330
I think it was good to reach out.

171
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,400
I've heard about you often.

172
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,730
Did the rumor that I want to crush Baek Jenna

173
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,400
reach all the way over there?

174
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,330
You could say that.

175
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,570
That's why I'm here.

176
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,800
I think I could

177
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,330
be quite helpful to you.

178
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,370
The same

179
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,230
goes for me.

180
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,470
Mind if I sit for a moment?

181
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,070
Sorry,

182
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,930
but I'm not leaving this school.

183
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,970
Hey...

184
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,100
Let's pretend that never happened.

185
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,100
Can we talk for a minute?

186
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,000
Do you know why Seo Do Un was kicked out?

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,470
Baek Jenna kicked out Seo Do Un

188
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,900
to stick Kim Hye In in his place.

189
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,870
Her friend of 18 years.

190
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,330
While you were hovering between
life and death in the hospital,

191
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,430
you know how Kim Hye In

192
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,930
got in here, right?

193
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,770
So?

194
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,300
Between Kim Hye In

195
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
and me,

196
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,800
who's more horrifying?

197
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,770
You know what they say, the enemy of my enemy

198
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,600
can be my friend.

199
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,500
We'll get

200
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,470
very close soon.

201
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,170
[Hanmyeong Group's next generation]

202
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,630
Turn around.

203
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,270
Yes.

204
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,230
Lee Sa Rang,

205
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,970
I know you have Oh Si Eun's phone.

206
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,630
If you don't want it exposed, come here.

207
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,070
- Saturday night at 11.
- What's so serious?

208
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,830
Ah, you startled me!

209
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,670
Oh!

210
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,630
Oh my, who is this?

211
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,230
The heir of Hanmyeong Group

212
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,930
has come to such a humble place.

213
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,170
Why are you here?

214
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,330
It may be humble, but have a seat.

215
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,470
You go sit, too.

216
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,330
Sun Joo...

217
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,400
Wow, it's the same uniform,

218
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,030
but this one is just gleaming. It's shining.

219
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
I'll give you a drink on the house.

220
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,130
We have malt whisky here.

221
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,530
How about it, a strong glass?

222
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,070
Just give me a coffee.

223
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,870
Oh, coffee.

224
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,270
When it comes to coffee, that's me.

225
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,770
I won first place
at the international barista competition

226
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,800
this year...

227
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,700
Sun Joo,

228
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,000
stop it.

229
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,300
You live such an easy life.

230
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,830
I guess making a fool out of
someone is nothing to you.

231
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,570
If this is about the party yesterday,

232
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,370
I thought you'd be thanking me.

233
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,030
What?

234
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,130
I put you on the same level as Min Yul Hee.

235
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,770
In front of everyone.

236
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,400
Hey, are you crazy?

237
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,270
I never wanted that. What kind of...

238
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,070
It was your choice to wear that dress.

239
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,670
I may have given you the dress

240
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,400
and a spot in the Diamond 6,

241
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,370
but it's up to you to live up to that level.

242
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,730
Since you've made a move for me on my chessboard,

243
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,830
I'll grant you a favor later.

244
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,300
This is the material for tomorrow's interview.

245
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,530
Do it well.

246
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,430
I don't need it, so take it back.

247
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,330
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

248
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,630
But the scholarship foundation
won't just stand by.

249
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,070
In the worst-case scenario,

250
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,400
it could be revoked.

251
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,630
Hello.

252
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,100
I am Kim Hye In, a sophomore
at Cheongdam International High School,

253
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
selected as a scholarship recipient
by the Hanmyeong Scholarship Foundation.

254
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,570
First, I would like to express my gratitude

255
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,000
to Chairman Baek Joo Won

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,570
and many officials

257
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,700
who gave me the opportunity to have this interview

258
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,530
in such a joyous and proud setting.

259
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,530
Furthermore, I would like to once
again express my deep gratitude

260
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,870
for giving students like me,

261
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,500
who entered through the equal
opportunity program, the hope and opportunity

262
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,100
to become a member of Hanmyeong if we work hard.

263
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,270
Thank you.

264
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,670
No CCTV, perfect.

265
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,970
Perfect timing.

266
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,800
How dare you humiliate me like that!

267
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Where does a Leech think she's going,
acting all high and mighty?

268
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,130
You are a Diamond 6?

269
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,330
What the heck?

270
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,330
Darn it!

271
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,770
Darn it! Seriously!

272
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,300
Hey, does it hurt?

273
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,930
Does it hurt a lot?

274
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,330
You didn't know?

275
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,000
Life is pain, you scum.

276
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,570
Watch your back at night.

277
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,700
What?

278
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,970
There you are.

279
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,130
You did well in the interview.

280
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,900
Hey!

281
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,600
Hey!

282
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,470
What?

283
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,800
Your interview during the day went well.

284
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,070
Hey, has the issue with that pervert's video

285
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,930
been resolved?

286
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,500
What is this?

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,100
Do you

288
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,770
happen to know anything

289
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,230
about Lee Sa Rang?

290
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,070
Lee Sa Rang?

291
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,900
Why?

292
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,070
You've been hanging around together lately.

293
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,200
Could it be...

294
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,970
Could it be, what?

295
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,530
Hey, snap out of it.

296
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,900
He's the same as the others.

297
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,800
Just like when Seo Do Un met Kim Hae In.

298
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Like some kind of

299
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
decorative item?

300
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,800
No, that's not it.

301
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,300
A little while ago,

302
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,100
I saw Oh Si Eun's phone

303
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,370
in Lee Sa Rang's bag.

304
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh Si Eun's phone?

305
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,170
Can I call you Jin Wook?

306
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes, Mother.

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,170
Already calling me Mother?

308
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,330
I'm in a good mood.

309
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,330
Jenna is getting along well
with Jin Wook too. I'm relieved.

310
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,870
We are getting along much better than you thought.

311
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,200
Your father seems busy lately.

312
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,770
Do you meet often?

313
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,630
Yes, I see him and greet him every day.

314
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,230
It couldn't have been easy
to secure the management shares.

315
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,130
Yes.

316
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,370
So, about that,

317
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,130
Jenna and Hanmyeong Group

318
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,030
will become a great source of strength for you.

319
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,400
Jin Wook, you too

320
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,600
should become an asset to Jenna and Hanmyeong.

321
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
Yes.

322
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,670
I should also meet Jin Wook's
mother and pay my respects.

323
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,930
She'll soon become Jenna's mother-in-law,

324
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,470
isn't that right, Chairman?

325
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,070
Yes, arrange it when there's an opportunity.

326
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,400
My mother will return to Korea soon.

327
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,270
As soon as she returns,

328
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,470
I'll set up a meeting.

329
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,800
Great.

330
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,270
I look forward to meeting her soon.

331
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,970
She raised her son exceptionally well.

332
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,470
If our son

333
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,200
grows up as fine as Jin Wook,
I'll have no regrets.

334
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,800
Thank you for saying that.

335
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,070
Well then,

336
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,330
you two stay a bit longer.

337
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,570
I have a business trip tomorrow
morning, so I'll get going.

338
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,430
Let's meet again in a nice setting next time.

339
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,670
Yes, please get home safely.

340
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,470
Let's go.

341
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,200
Jenna.

342
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,630
What's wrong?

343
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,530
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

344
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll leave too.

345
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,300
Did I do something wrong again?

346
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,070
Let go.

347
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,730
If something bothers you, say it.

348
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,530
Don't tell me

349
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,800
it's because of what she said,
about hoping your brother

350
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,930
would be like me.

351
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,900
Who is my brother?

352
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,230
That illegitimate child?

353
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,530
Why?

354
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,370
Does seeing me make you feel
like crap because it's like looking

355
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,370
at your brother's future?

356
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,300
I find his very existence horrifying.

357
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,670
[Father]

358
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,030
Yes, Father.

359
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,030
Chairman Baek seems to like you a lot.

360
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,330
For them to bring up the engagement first,

361
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,470
our Jin Wook is truly outstanding.

362
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,530
As expected, you're different from
your brothers, right down to your genes.

363
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,700
Yes, Father.

364
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,530
I'll make sure not to disappoint you.

365
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,400
Once we are tied to Hanmyeong through marriage,

366
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
we begin the operation.

367
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,230
Hanmyeong will be ours now too.

368
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,570
Make absolutely no mistakes.

369
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,800
Of course.

370
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,670
Yes, get some rest.

371
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,530
How is the acquisition of the
Hanmyeong Holdings shares going?

372
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,000

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,770
Oh.

[List of Major Shareholders
and Share Transfer Signatures]

377
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,500
What are your plans for Jin Wook?

378
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,600
That bastard?

379
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,400
Once we secure Hanmyeong Group's shares,

380
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,700
get rid of him discreetly.

381
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,470
Understood.

382
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,600
It's late, Hye In.

383
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,570
Are you eating ramen again?

384
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,530
Ramen is surprisingly healthy.

385
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
You're

386
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,730
having dinner properly, right?

387
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,200
Of course.

388
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,130
I eat well at the lounge.

389
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,870
I brought this from the lounge.

390
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,570
Eat it while you work.

Is it okay to just take these?

393
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,870
Sure.

394
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,770
Dad.

395
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,070
Yes, what is it?

396
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,930
I'll do well.

397

I know you'll do well.

I left a gift.

402
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,330
- A gift?
- Yes.

403

I was wondering whom Jenna got her beauty from.

408
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,130
As expected, she takes after her mother.

409
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,900
Actually, I do hear that quite a bit.

410
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,830
What's up with you?

411
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,270
Oh, Jenna!

412
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,470
You should've introduced us earlier.

413
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,430
I came to pay my respects.

414
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,030
Jin Wook is so admirable.

415
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,000
Did you know that?

416
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,470
Someone was sending me flowers
every single day, so I thought it was you.

417
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,100
But it turned out to be him.

418
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,000
When you get older, things like this
are so heart-fluttering and nice.

419
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,100
Mother,

420
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,030
I'll make sure you get flowers every single day.

421
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,000
- Really?
- Yes.

422
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,030
So you can always feel that flutter.

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,100
Then, I'd be very grateful.

of information gathering.

My mom really likes it.

It's been a while since
I've seen her smile like that.

429
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,170
It's the first time I've
seen you smile like that, too.

430
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,930
I'm sorry about that day.

It's fine.

Hyun Jin, I told you not
to run in places like this.

436

It's the first time I've seen you smile like that.

Me?

438
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,970
Usually, when you smile, your eyes don't smile.

439
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,000
But when you just smiled,

440
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,030
your eyes smiled too.

441
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,970
I learned that smiling is also a skill.

442
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,930
Anyway, from what I can see,

443
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,300

sincere with Chairman Cha.

00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,570
What about your mom?

447
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,600
Is she in Singapore?

448
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400

I didn't know.

453
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,330
I'm just kidding.

454
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,670
She is in the US,

You said earlier that you
have to prove your worth.

458
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,730
As you know, I'm no different.

459
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,530
I have to prove

460
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,600
my worth too.

461
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,930

You crazy punk! Are you threatening me right now?

00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,500
Why are you so curious whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?

The heir of Hanmyeong Group.

466

In that sense,

467
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,320
can I ask one favor?

468
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,630
Yes.

00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,100
It's not too difficult.

472
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,500
Aren't you going to ask why?

473
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,300
No need.

474
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,930
Is there really a need to ask?

475
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,270
It's something Baek Jenna is doing.

476
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,300
There must be a reason for it all.

00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,230
Student Kim Hae In?

478
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,270
May I sit for a moment?

479
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,630
Yes.

480
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,600
I knew about you for a while,
but my greeting is late.

481
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,100
I'm Director Seo Hee Kwon.

482
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,300
Yes, I know.

483
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,230
Any issues since returning to school?

484
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,930
No.

485
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,430
Everyone treats me well.

486
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,530
Good. That's a relief.

487
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,400
You came back after much difficulty,
so you must adapt well.

488
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,930
Yes.

489
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,470
By any chance,

490
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,870
if your memories return,

491
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,470
make sure to tell me.

492
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,900

493
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,730

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,570
Do you have something to say?

496
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,600
No, Director.

497
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,530
But it's polite to greet an elder

498
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,300
when you meet one.

499
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,500
Let's talk for a minute.

500
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,330
How long are you going to keep avoiding me?

501
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,070
I was wrong back then. I'm sorry.

502
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,070
You don't need to apologize.

503
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,800
You don't have to.

504
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,070
- I'll take you home later.
- No,

505
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,330
you don't have to.

506
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,770
I don't have time for useless
things like this anymore.

507
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,900
Hae In, what are you talking about?

508
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
From now on, you and I

509
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,200
have nothing to do with each other.

510
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
The position Kim Hye In held,

511
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,370
I'll claim it.

512
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,330
That's what's most important to me right now.

513
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,630
To me, you're...

514
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,730
no use anymore.

515
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,230
Got it.

516
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,330
I get it for now, so first...

517
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,270

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,530
are you stupid?

520
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:59,070
The old Kim Hae In was fake.
The current one is real.

521
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,370
You think the Diamond 6 is no big deal?

522
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,430
You wouldn't know since you were in it.

523
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,370
You'll never understand until you die.

524
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,770
Honestly, I liked you
because you were a bit naive.

525
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,500
Now, it's getting a little boring.

526
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,170
So, can you stop clinging to me

527
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
and get lost?

528
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,300
Here.

529
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,630
Look.

530
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,900
Woo Jin!

531
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,070
Thank you.

532
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,900
Do you like it?

533
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,570
You're coming to the club this weekend, right?

534
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,470
Of course, I'm going.

535
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,530
You, really...

536
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,530
But you

537
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,370
are unexpected.

538
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,930
What are you talking about?

539
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,170
Letting Park Woo Jin act like that...

540
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,330
Don't tell me

541
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,430
you're the only one who doesn't know

542
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,930
how pretty and charming you are.

543
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,470
Will you

544
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,800
go somewhere with me?
