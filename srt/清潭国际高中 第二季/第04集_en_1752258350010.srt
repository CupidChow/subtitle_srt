00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,233
Aren't you taking the tray away?

190
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,933
Goodness…

191
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,367
Did you hear that story?

192
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,700
What story?

193
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
When Oh Si Eun died,

194
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,367
her phone disappeared.

195
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:59,533
And on it, there were videos
she used to blackmail other kids.

196
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,233
But among them…

197
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,067
Among them?

198
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,800
That…

199
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,367
What is it?

200
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:10,500
Why do you stop talking
in the middle of a sentence?

201
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,333
I was being blackmailed by Oh Si Eun too.

202
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,100
That pervert Lee Deok Min

203
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,133
told me to change clothes right in front of him.

204
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,967
So?

205
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,433
What?

206
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,300
So?

207
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,533
Hey!

208
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,100
Who do you think I made that video for?

209
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,233
To pay off the dress you ruined.

210
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,900
Because of that 8 million won…

211
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,700
That's why.

212
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,567
You took off your clothes
for a measly 8 million won?

213
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,233
To you, it might be just a measly 8 million won,

214
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,400
but don't you think I stripped

215
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,233
because that's how desperate I was?

216
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,033
What?

217
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:56,233
You're having a private conversation,
and I just barged in cluelessly?

218
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,933
Should I leave?

219
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,767
No need.

220
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,700
We're planning a party this weekend.

221
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,533
You'll come, right?

222
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,633
Do you want to come too?

223
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,667
Me?

224
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,667
I'm not really interested in parties.

225
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,367
Really?

226
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,600
The others seem to have high expectations.

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Like, "let's see Cha Jin Wook's
scale" or something…

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
You'll come, right?

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,233
Fine, I get it. So go away.

230
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,700
We were in the middle of a conversation.

231
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,767
No.

232
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,267
The conversation is over.

233
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm off now.

234
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,467
That's unexpected.

235
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,667
You have friends too.

236
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,167
Friends?

237
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,567
What?

238
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,367
Did you hear that too?

239
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,467
This is Oh Si Eun's voice,
right? The laughing part.

240
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,967
Yeah, that's right, Oh Si Eun.

241
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,000
So creepy.

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What are you talking about?

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,067
Why do we hear her voice here? It's scary.

244
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,100
Hey, listen.

245
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,567
This is 100% Oh Si Eun's laughter.

246
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,133
Right?

247
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:07,400
Crazy, did Oh Si Eun record this then?

248
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:56,367
Take this out.

249
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,933
Sorry, did I scare you?

250
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,467
You don't know me, right?

251
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm Park Woo Jin.

252
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,100
I have something to say.

253
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,067
Do you have a moment?

254
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:18,467
I wanted to talk somewhere quiet.

255
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:24,900
I was really surprised you came back to school.

256
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,967
I was really worried,

257
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,967
so I'm glad you're okay.

258
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:32,467
Do you maybe not remember me?

259
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,833
Yeah.

260
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,667
Sorry.

261
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,200
Then,

262
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
you don't remember this, either?

263
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you doing?

264
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,500
What could it be?

265
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,567
You blackmailed me with the hidden
camera video you got from Oh Si Eun,

266
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,500
you dirty girl.

267
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,900
No, I…

268
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,333
I almost hit rock bottom because of you!

269
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,033
And you get the convenient out of having amnesia?

270
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,933
Do you really not remember?

271
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:22,567
You don't remember sleeping with me, either?

272
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,500
After we slept together,

273
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:33,000
I even bought you expensive things.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,133
It makes me curious…

275
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,667
if I buy you expensive things now,

276
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,433
is it still possible?

277
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:49,767
Ah, what should I wear this weekend?

278
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:53,700
You look like a goddess no matter what you wear.

279
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,367
Goddess, my ass.

280
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,067
Just a girl, right?

281
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,300
Just a girl.

282
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,400
What?

283
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,133
Ah…

284
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:08,067
You're jealous because
you don't have to choose clothes.

285
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,267
Why doesn't Bo Seok choose clothes?

286
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,900
He found a partner for the party.

287
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,933
Oh, I see.

288
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,900
I thought you wouldn't come
because you'd be too embarrassed,

289
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,833
since the Diamond 6 member
Kim Hye In will be there.

290
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,667
Do you wanna die?

291
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,267
Hey, Equal Opportunity Leech,

292
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:30,500
when you see someone,
you should greet them before leaving.

293
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Move.

294
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,067
Move?

295
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,267
Ah, these annoying leeches!

296
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,600
Did you both go crazy together?

297
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,000
Hey, just because Kim Hye In became
a Diamond 6, do you think you're something?

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,300
Oh, darn, really!

299
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,433
Hey!

300
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,133
You said it was amnesia.

301
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:54,300
For memory loss,

302
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,867
you need to stimulate brain cells.

303
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,233
Will that be enough?

304
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,200
Exactly, surely,

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,233
you have to do it strongly.

306
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,533
- Like this…
- Hey!

307
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,867
Stop it!

308
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,233
Let's go.

309
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,700
I have organized the dress for you to wear

310
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,733
at the party of Mr. Cha Jin Wook.

311
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:39,267
I've checked off the ones that
the kids of other esteemed families

312
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,667
are paying attention to.

313
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,767
This dress,

314
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,867
send it to Kim Hye In's house.

315
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,400
Yes.

316
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,067
Well…

317
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,500
Cha Jin Wook

318
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,100
is throwing a party this weekend.

319
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,533
Why didn't you ask me to go?

320
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,700
Ah, it's just that…

321
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,400
- me and them now…
- I want to go too.

322
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,567
As your partner.

323
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,867
They say we used to date secretly.

324
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:33,233
It was like that in the past,

325
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,700
but not anymore.

326
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,967
Hae In, you

327
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,867
still don't know, right?

328
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,767
What?

329
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,500
Never mind.

330
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,000
Alright, let's go.

331
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,700
Yes.

332
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,300
Why aren't you eating?

333
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,267
It's delicious, though.

334
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,167
Here.

335
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,533
- Isn't it tasty?
- Eat it all.

336
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,133
Shall we go?

337
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,933
Okay.

338
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,000
Wait a moment.

339
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:42,400
It's cold.

340
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,433
Thank you.

341
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,867
It looks good on you.

342
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:46,667
Let's go.

343
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:06,867
Hey, Kim Hye In!

344
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:07,933
Ah, I told you to knock!

345
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,367
- What is this?
- What?

346
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,600
I don't know. What is it?

347
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,900
Do you think I'm your delivery man?

348
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,467
What is it?

349
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,600
What is it?

350
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,467
Baek Jenna.

351
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:14,933
Do Un, can I go look in the mirror?

352
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,667
You can enter first.

353
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,700
No, I'll wait here.

354
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,767
Go and come back.

355
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:21,833
I'll be back quickly.

356
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,633
Okay.

357
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,167
Huh?

358
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,300
Seo Do Un,

359
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,800
you're here?

360
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah.

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
Wow!

362
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,333
This place is really nice!

363
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,333
How is it?

364
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,567
Do I look a bit weird?

365
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,333
Wow!

366
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,667
You can't find the old Kim Hye In anymore.

367
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:03,933
Old?

368
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,700
Are you insulting me right now?

369
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,900
No, it's a compliment this time.

370
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,233
Thanks.

371
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:12,033
Let's go together. Aren't you going in?

372
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,333
I came with Hae In.

373
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,300
I'm waiting while she went somewhere for a moment.

374
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:18,700
Ah.

375
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,933
Kim Hae In.

376
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,067
Hey, isn't that Kim Hae In?

377
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,133
Why is someone like that here? It's disgusting!

378
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,933
Ah, seriously!

379
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,600
So, you're out of your mind.

380
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,833
What makes you think you can come here?

381
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,633
Why? Can't I come?

382
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:58,600
I was invited too.

383
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,333
You were invited?

384
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,700
Ah, seriously!

385
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,633
What a load of nonsense.

386
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,433
I don't know who invited you,

387
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:09,433
as a partner, or whatever…

388
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,233
Seo Do Un?

389
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,200
Are you really naive now? Really…

390
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,667
Hey, get a grip!

391
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,667
Seo Do Un isn't a Diamond 6 anymore.

392
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,633
His dad was ousted ages ago,
and you're still sticking around?

393
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,367
Moreover, that guy's dad

394
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:29,567
must be in a bad position, as he was
completely pushed out by his younger brother.

395
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,467
So what?

396
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:33,867
I don't care.

397
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:36,367
You don't care?

398
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,967
That's hilarious.

399
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,600
Hey,

400
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,867
I don't know what kind of
trick you're trying to pull,

401
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:44,567
but you should just live quietly.

402
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,933
It'd be even better if you
transfer to another school.

403
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:04,600
Park Woo Jin,

404
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,367
you don't know

405
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,600
who pushed me, do you?

406
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,333
Someone who knows

407
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,033
that you and I had sex.

408
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:19,467
Someone who knows that

409
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:22,167
and wants to kill me.

410
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,267
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

411
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,900
I wonder if you get it after I've said this much.

412
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:40,667
How is Hae In these days?

413
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:43,133
What do you mean, "how is Hae In these days"?

414
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:45,133
What does that mean?

415
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,967
Uh… well…

416
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,533
Does she talk about me,

417
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:56,067
or has her memory returned, or anything like that?

418
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,567
No.

419
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,933
Does Hae In recognize you?

420
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:06,067
No, what are you talking about?

421
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,367
There's no way.

422
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,767
I was just asking.

423
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,667
I'm off now.

424
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,133
Do Un.

425
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:20,600
Have you been waiting long?

426
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,333
No, let's go in.

427
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,233
Cheers!

428
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,500
What is it?

429
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,300
Hey, are you okay?

430
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,533
Hye In!

431
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,367
Would you like some champagne?

432
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,533
Lee Sa Rang,

433
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:08,400
I have something to ask you.
Can you step outside for a moment?

434
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,133
It's the first time we're properly
introducing ourselves, right?

435
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,367
Huh?

436
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,933
You transferred too, didn't you?

437
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,567
I heard it was really hard to transfer here.

438
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,633
I paid a lot of money to get in.

439
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,100
How did you get in?

440
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Besides,

441
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,133
even up to Diamond 6?

442
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
I just got in because a spot opened up.

443
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,767
What do you want to talk about?

444
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,000
Should we move somewhere else to talk?

445
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,967
- Sure.
- This party today is

446
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,967
hosted by Cha Jin Wook.

447
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,900
For a short while,

448
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,600
we will now begin the couple's dance event!

449
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,100
The winning couple

450
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,467
will be gifted the highest-quality champagne,

451
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,667
Cristal!

452
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,333
Now, make some noise!

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
Okay, the first couple,

454
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,633
please raise your hands!

455
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,033
- Me!
- There?

456
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,033
- Come here.
- Hye In, come out.

457
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,700
- What?
- Come out, now.

458
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,000
- Me?
- Let's go!

459
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
Why me?

460
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:10,967
Come out!

461
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,500
Wow, Sa Rang!

462
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,500
Wow!

463
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,300
Oh, it's hard!

464
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,967
See?

465
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,900
You can do it.

466
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:42,333
Those guys,

467
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,167
got so excited since that video of Black Dog

468
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,967
came out.

469
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:47,800
Did you see it too?

470
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:51,033
Black Dog?

471
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,767
Isn't it disgusting how they pretend

472
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:56,333
not to care on the outside but get all excited

473
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,433
about trashy gossip like that?

474
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,800
Are they crazy?

475
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,800
Hey!

476
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,333
Who wants to see something interesting?

477
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,533
<i>My video?</i>

478
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:13,033
<i>Then, did Oh Si Eun film this?</i>

479
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,000
This crazy girl…

480
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,833
Jin Wook,

481
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:40,200
your mother is really a beauty.

482
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,767
Looking closely, I see

483
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:44,733
you got your pretty looks from your mom.

484
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:46,233
This bastard is crossing the line.

485
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:48,533
You brat! Hey, say that again.

486
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,133
- Let go!
- Say it again!

487
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,233
- What are you doing?
- Say it again.

488
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,567
- Hey!
- Huh?

489
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,633
Come out.

490
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:55,433
What are you doing?

491
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:58,433
This bastard did this to me first.

492
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm a bit late, right?

493
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:56,767
Let me introduce you, my fiancé, Cha Jin Wook.

494
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,167
That's right.

495
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,133
We're engaged.

496
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Don't be mistaken.

497
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:18,900
What, Baek Jenna?

498
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,933
You put the Equal Opportunity Leech in Diamond 6,

499
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,167
and now you're even engaged
to an illegitimate child?

500
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,400
How did you end up like this, Baek Jenna?

501
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:35,200
I don't think this is the time
for you to worry about me?

502
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:41,933
But, Yul Hee, you need to develop better taste.

503
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:47,667
Your eye for dresses is really quite poor?
