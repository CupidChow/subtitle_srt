00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,570
Park Woo Jin.

3
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,700
Is it okay for you to be in a place like this
with me, leaving Min Yul Hee behind?

4
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,670
Hey, it's fine. It doesn't matter.

5
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,230
She can't dump me now.

6
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,370
Want to do something fun with me?

7
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,200
Sure.

8
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,730
It's delicious.

9
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,800
Ah, I'm going to go for a smoke.

10
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,300
- Wait here.
- Come back quickly.

11
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,700
You came all the way here just to see that?

12
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,600
Exactly.

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I went through all this trouble just to see that.

14
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,030
You?

15
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,070
Are you okay?

16
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,670
If it were me, I wouldn't be okay.

17
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,930
Now that I've seen it for myself, I'm sure.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,730
Let's go now.

19
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,330
Did you come alone?

20
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,770
Hey, let's go.

21
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,200
Are you okay?

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Thanks for coming with me.

23
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,730
We're friends. This is nothing.

24
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
Then,

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,170
can I call you

26
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,400
when I'm having a hard time?

27
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,270
Sure.

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,870
Sun Joo,

29
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,670
is this right?

30
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,630
I...

31
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm so pretty.

32
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,900
Hye In,

33
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,130
as much as I love you, it's not to that extent.

34
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,700
Don't worry.

35
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,530
Okay.

36
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,000
But,

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,170
Lee Sa Rang will come, right?

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
What's so serious?

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,130
Ah, you startled me!

40
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,500
[Lee Sa Rang, I know you have Oh Si Eun's phone.
If you don't want it exposed, come here.]

Yeah, he'll come.

That's not what I meant.

51
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,700
Do I have to line up, too?

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,830
Yes, you have to line up.

55

Oppa!

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,700
If you keep this up, you'll be
banned from entry, okay?

57
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,200
Hye In, let's line up.

58
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
The line got longer.

59
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,170
Wait a second.

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,930
- Excuse me.
- Please line up.

61
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,270

Ah, I was going to give you
a ride if you didn't have one.

73
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,430
Give me a ride then.

74
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,100
Okay, I'll give you a ride. Let's go.

76
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,370
I saw Cha Jin Wook and Min Yul Hee earlier.

77

Huh? Why are they together?

78
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,670
Exactly.

79

What's going on?

80
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,230
Are they dating?

81
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,500
Are you crazy?

82
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,430
Cha Jin Wook is engaged to Baek Jenna.

83
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,470
Hey, it could happen.

84
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,300
Then would you be okay with
it if your boyfriend did that?

85
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,370
Are you insane?

86
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,530
I'd just kill both of them.

87
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,970
What? Your words don't make sense.

88
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,100

- Over there!

Why are you here?

94
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,900
Were you the one who sent the message?

95
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,630
Yes, I sent it.

Ah, what the...

Are you okay?

110
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,030
Oh no, what to do?

111
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,430
I should help him.

Be honest with me.

Why do you have it?

124
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,870
I'll tell you everything.

125
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,070
My brother, So Mang,

126
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,970
went to the school rooftop that night.

127
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,070
He was trying to stop Oh Si Eun
from leaking your video.

128
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,170
But Oh Si Eun was already
arguing with someone else.

129
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,170
Jezz, give me that!

130
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,230
With whom?

131
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,800
Then, isn't that person the culprit?

132
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,170
So, did So Mang see the culprit's face?

133
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,530
No.

134
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,730
It was too dark to see the culprit,

135
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,470
but he saw Oh Si Eun filming
the other person with her phone.

136
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,300
Then the culprit's face must be
captured in Oh Si Eun's footage.

137
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,770
I suppose so.

138
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,970
I kept the phone because of you.

139
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,670
Because I had to delete the video.

140
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,500
Then,

141
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,300
what about my video?

142
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,530
Was it deleted?

143
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,300
There was a password on the phone,
so I couldn't even open it.

It was important, that's why
I carried it around with me.

This is driving me crazy.

148

This is serious.

149

Wait a minute.

150
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,970
Okay. Let's summarize it.

151
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,930
The person who took Oh Si Eun's phone

152
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,070
is the culprit.

153
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,100
And now that person

154
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,900
has my video too.

155
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,400
We have to catch that bastard.

My video is one thing,

157
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,600
but that person is definitely
the one who pushed Oh Si Eun.

158
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,530
First, check if that bastard
Lee Deok Min is still in Singapore.

159

Understood.

160
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,770
But how do we catch them?

161
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,070
Let's start

162
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,970
by checking the club's CCTV.

163
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,570
Everyone, take out some cash.

164
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,370
Who carries cash these days?

165
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,830
But why was Jenna there earlier?

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Baek Jenna?

167
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,230
Hey!

168
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,670
I saw Oh Si Eun's phone

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,100
in Lee Sa Rang's bag.

170
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100

171
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,070
What's wrong? Why are you here?

172
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,730
You have my video on your phone, don't you?

173
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,730
Bring it here.

174
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,770

- You crazy, hurry up and give it to me.
- Give it back.

away, and the date is a bonus.

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,700
Wait! Your number!

183
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,030
Lee Deok Min is in Singapore.

184
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,430
It's not him, either.

185
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,300
Where on earth are they?

186
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,900

314
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,770
Yes.

315
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm going to make it happen, no matter what.

316

317
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,670
This is why you should choose better company.

331
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,600

335
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,370
It's called a marriage,

but it's really just Hanmyeong and Chasel
Medic doing business with their children.

what does that make Jin Wook,

339

No,

341
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,570
it's not that I don't care,
it's that there's no problem.

342
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,500
Because Jenna

343
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,000

344
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,070

didn't do it.

347
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,930
So our engagement has

348

no issues.

349
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,600

Hey, bastard.

355
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,970
You and I have something to talk about.

356
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,300
Anyone who saw you would be completely
fooled into thinking you're in love.

Are you talking about yourself?

359
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,100
I heard the rumors that
you sleep around with anyone.

360
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,330
You bastard!

361
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,370
Don't play innocent.

362
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,730

365
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,270
And even if you do,

366
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,200
can you do anything with it?

367
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,770
That's just spitting in your own face, you know?

368
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,600
Woo Jin,

369
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,470
what are you going to do, being so stupid?

370
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,000
Huh?

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,130
Statistically speaking,

372
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,630
it seems more likely that you'll be

373
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,100
the one kicked out of the Diamond 6 first.

374
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,670
I'm leaving.

375
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,730
Has a decision been made on which side

376
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,470
the Cheongjae Foundation will take, Mr. Chairman?

377
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,530
It is a matter of great importance,

378
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,600
so we are discussing it at the foundation level.

379
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,530
The Cheongjae Foundation's coffers will be full

380
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,430
only when we take over Hanmyeong Holdings.

381
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,800
There is a timing for everything.

382
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,530
Yes, I'm well aware.

383
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,570
If it is hard for you to decide,
shall I offer you some help?

384
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:37,000
A big problem is about to erupt
at the school because of Hanmyeong.

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,230
Mr. Chairman, do you still not know?

386
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,900
No, well...

387
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,700
The drug news...

388
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,270
My man that I planted in Hanmyeong

389
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,170
works very well.

390
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,130
It would be best to make your decision quickly.

391
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,770
Understood, Mr. Chairman.

392
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,970
I'll contact you again.

393
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,730
What?

394
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,500
Move.

395
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,670
They say

396
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,270
they saw you putting the drugs in your locker.

397
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,800
Right, Ga Young?

398
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,600
Ah...

399
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,570
Yes.

400
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,400
You must have been distraught
because of the gossip anyway,

401
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
but how dare someone suspect Baek Jenna!

402
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,770
Now you're resorting
to all sorts of pathetic tricks.

403
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,300
If you have nothing to hide,
there's no reason you can't open it.

404
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,100
Open it?

405
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,630
Go ahead and open it.

406
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,770
Hey, I'll open it for you.

407
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,000
- There's nothing here.
- What?

408
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,800
Move aside.

409
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,970
Having fun?

410
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,630
I thought I was dying of boredom.

411
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,730
Where is it?

412
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,500
What are you doing? Stop it!

413
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,570
Hey, Leech!

414
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,970
Where do you think you're butting in?

415
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,130
Hey, I said stop it!

416
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,330
- Hey.
- Where did you hide it?

417
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,670
Where the hell did you hide it?

418
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,670
There's nothing here.

419
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,470
Hey, hey!

420
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,270
Isn't this it?

421
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,230
Did you really go this far, Baek Jenna?

422
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,030
Get lost! Are you all insane?

423
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,970
But I bet I'm not the only one injured.

424
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,170
His wrist must be wrecked too.

425
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,600
Won't you hand it over?

426
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,670
Baek Jenna is a total junkie.

427
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,670
It was real drugs.

428
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,970
Wow, the gossip was true.

429
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,800
Huh? Wow, it's real.

430
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,870
What is this commotion?

431
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Mr. Chairman.

432
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,900
I mean, this was found in our sacred school.

433
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,500
What do we do now?

434
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,430
Student Baek Jenna, let's talk for a minute.

435
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,870
Mr. Chairman,

436
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,530
it's not me.

437
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,000
Do you think I'd be crazy enough
to do something like this?

438
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,930
Do you not grasp the situation?

439
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,000
You need to get tested and clear this up cleanly.

440
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
This isn't something to be emotional about.

441
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,070
Do you think my father will let that happen?

442
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,430
Chairman Baek has already given his permission.

443
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,370
Do you get it now?

444
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,830
Do you understand what kind of situation this is?

445
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,470
Contact Chairman Cha

446
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,500
and tell him I'd like to treat him to dinner soon.

447
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,570
Yes, understood.

448
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,130
This is Korea, you know.

449
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,770
A drug charge is the end.

450
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,230
But there's no way

451
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,600
the heir to Hanmyeong Group would
do something like drugs, right?

452
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,170
Hey, but

453
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,230
what happens if it's true?

454
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,430
What do you mean 'what happens'?

455
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,370
Your life is over in a single shot.

456
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,400
What was the great Baek Jenna lacking
that she would do something like that?

457
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,700
Exactly, and of all people?

458
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,570
She must have had her own struggles.

459
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,170
Her mom's an alcoholic,

460
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,800
her parents are divorced,

461
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,200
and her teacher became her stepmom.

462
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,370
Oh, no!

463
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,100
On top of that, she's about
to have a half-brother.

464
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,200
Come to think of it,

465
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,270
wouldn't it be weirder if she didn't do drugs?

466
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,100
Exactly.

467
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Hey, Min Yul Hee,

468
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,500
don't you think you're going too far?

469
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,300
Why?

470
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,930
Did my words offend Baek Jenna's

471
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,370
handmaiden?

472
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,470
Looking at her, you really have a strong stomach.

473
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,070
Becoming a handmaiden for Baek Jenna
just to get into the Diamond 6.

474
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,300
Don't tell me

475
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,070
you're the one who brought her the drugs.

476
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,370
What makes you so certain?

477
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,030
What?

478
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,370
It's obvious.

479
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,730
The results aren't even out yet,
but you act like you know everything.

480
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,000
I've been feeling this for a while,

481
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,730
but you're even dumber than I thought.

482
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,100
If you're so certain,

483
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,400
aren't you just revealing

484
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,770
that you're the one who did it?

485
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,800
Hey!

486
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,970
Are you that crazy?

487
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,000
The results aren't out yet.

488
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,700
And you should keep a better
leash on your own fiancé.

489
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,800
There are rumors

490
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,330
that he's the one doing drugs at clubs these days.

491
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,730
Ah, you crazy leech! Are you insane?

492
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,300
Fine!

493
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,330
Let's wait and see

494
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,400
what kind of results come out.

495
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,170
The test came back positive.

496
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,300
[Cederex positive]

497
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,570
I'll send you a few photos.

498
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,530
There's a medicine Jenna takes.

499
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,730
You should

500
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,270
expose it, Yul Hee.

501
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,170
If Jenna just takes a drug test,

502
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,770
something interesting will happen.

503
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,830
Medicine?
