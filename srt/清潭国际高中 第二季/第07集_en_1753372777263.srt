[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,930
The test...

3
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,600
came back positive.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,830
[Cederex positive]

5
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,370
I didn't do it!

6
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,870
I really didn't!

7
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,430
The National Forensic Service
will conduct a detailed hair analysis.

8
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,600
If that also comes back positive...

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,870
I did not do it!

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,130
Student Baek Jenna,

11
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,830
we must follow the rules and procedures.

12
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,770
We'll mobilize all our channel
resources to the fullest

13
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,870
and make the biggest splash.

14
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,770
You're doing well.

15
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,200
Yes, please proceed that way.

16
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,800
I...

17
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,930
did everything you told me to do,

18
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,030
and Baek Jenna

19
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,800
ended up exactly as you wanted.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,070
Hm...

21
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,270
So?

22
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,570
Delete the video.

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,770
What video?

24
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,170
Are you pretending not to know?

25
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,270
Oh, that one?

26
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,470
I don't want to.

27
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,470
I did everything you asked.

28
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,770
You think that's enough?

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,670
You should be grateful

30
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,530
that I'm even looking at you.

31
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,730
So all that talk

32
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,230
about making me your pet
and getting me into Diamond 6

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,370
was just a game to you?

34
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,830
Hey, how old are you?

35
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,170
Gosh, you're so naive.

36
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,700
You actually believed that?

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,900
Min Yul Hee!

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,870
Why?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,530
If you act like a pet one more time,

40
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,470
I'll delete it then.

41
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,730
Stop crying

42
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,000
and learn to trust.

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,630
This time too.

46
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,370
Cha Jin Wook,

47
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,400
what did I tell you?

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,430
Isn't it clear now?

49
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,900
What suits you

50
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,670
isn't Baek Jenna, but me.

51

[Kim Hae In]

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,230
Baek Jenna's trouble

53
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,230
is your doing?

54
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,170
My doing?

55
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,200
You can't marry Baek Jenna.

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Even if it's Hanmyeong Group,

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,700
would your father accept her into the family?

58
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,700
She might have taken the medicine unknowingly,

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,130
or could have been caught in a trap.

60
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,170
Her stepmother confirmed it herself.

61
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,030
Stepmother?

62
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,430
But, Yul Hee,

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,300

64
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,200
know all sorts of things.

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,600
The daughter is a drug addict,
and the father is an adulterer.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,430
Hanmyeong will have no end to this in the future.

67
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,930
Is there any need to choose her?

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,130
Think carefully.

69
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,730
Who would be a better spouse

70
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,900

71
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,000
You have to tell them

72
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,570
that Min Yul Hee pushed me.

73
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you crazy?

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,300
Why should I do that?

75
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,570
Because you're the one

76
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,330
who has Min Yul Hee's necklace.

77
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,530
That necklace...

78
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,770
<i>You said we should make a deal.</i>

79
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,400
<i>That it's something no one should know.</i>

80
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,700
<i>Isn't this enough for a deal?</i>

81
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,300
Wait for the critical moment.

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,000
If you act recklessly,
we'll be the ones to suffer.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
We?

84
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,630
Don't say 'we'.

Why are you and I a 'we'?

89

Me!

90

What am I? Me!

91

I'm being threatened by a murderer.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,400
But even if I do what that
bitch says, nothing changes.

93
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,100
You know my situation too.

94
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,600
I want to escape this disgusting ground.

95
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,270

What do you think will change
if you enter Diamond 6?

101
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,330
Nothing will change, and...

102
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,330
This?

103
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,130
All of this is just an illusion

105
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,000
Ah, seriously!

106
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,530
You're acting like this.

107
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,970
Does Seo Do Un know about this too?

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,270

109
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,600

Did you think I wouldn't know?

111
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,030
I know you messed with Seo Do Un
while I was gone. I know everything.

112
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,300
Give back everything that's mine!

113
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
You messed with everything of mine, you know?

114
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,770
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,770
No, let me go!

116
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,630
Let go!

117
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,170
Fine.

118
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,200
handle everything myself.

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,770

122
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,320
I'll go see the chairman.

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,680
And once it's sorted,

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,600
I'll go to the police station.

125
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,630
It won't take long.

126
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,570
Really?

127
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,500
Does that mean everything will end soon for me?

128
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Are you finally saving me from Min Yul Hee?

129
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,770

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, let's do that.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
It seems Jenna did this without knowing.

190
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,570
The lawyer said that point
will be taken into consideration.

191
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,400
The school is also making efforts.

192
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,270
You have always worked hard for us.

193
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,230
Don't mention it.

194
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,630
Well, then,

195
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,470
let's proceed with our children's
engagement ceremony as planned.

196
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,570
I'm grateful to hear you say that.

197
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,170
For business people,

198
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,330
isn't this level of risk always present?

199
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,030
Thank you for understanding.

200
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,530
But, well...

201
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,430
From our perspective,

202
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,370
it's about shouldering the risk
for one person, right?

203
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,930
Instead of us sharing the risk for one person,

204
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,930
we'd like you to show some sincerity.

205
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,200
What do you mean?

206
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,330
A request to sell Hanmyeong Holdings shares

207
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,030
allocated to Jin Wook's portion.

208
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,770
Given that we're about to become in-laws,

209
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,470
consider this an investment
for the children's future.

210
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,700
You should think of it that way.

211
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,300
The investment in our Chasel Medic division

212
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,830
will be handled by Jin Wook.

213
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,800
The engagement ceremony will proceed as scheduled.

214
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,070
You can take responsibility
for your own words, can't you?

215
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,830
- Yes.
- This matter

216
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,200
must not fail under any circumstances.

217
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Hearing that I'm bringing in
a drug-addict daughter-in-law

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,830
isn't a solution, you know?

219
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,030
I understand.

220
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,900
I will

221
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,970
resolve it without fail.

222
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,370
Call her.

223
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,170
Now.

224
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Who is this?

225
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,530
What?

226
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,130
Can you let me stay

227
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,770
just for one night?

228
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,600
Come in.

229
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,500
It's cancer.

230
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,570
By the time I realized, it was too late.

231
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,070
You should have told me
if you brought in a friend.

232
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,070
- Huh?
- Here.

233
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,530
When did you buy this?

234
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,330
The floor is warm?

235
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,630
- You're not cold?
- No, not at all.

236
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,100
I will make breakfast in the morning,

237
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,400
so eat with your friend before leaving.

238
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,070
I'm fine.

239
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,130
I don't usually eat breakfast.

240
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,730
She will not eat. Just leave.

241
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,370
Alright? Then I'll crank up the boiler,

242
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,770
so sleep comfortably.

243
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,830
Yes.

244
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,500
Thank you for your concern.

245
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,100
Your friend is so kind and polite.

246
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,730
Oh, so sweet.

247
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,800
Dad!

248
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,870
She's not nice.

249
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,170
- Get out.
- Yeah, okay.

250
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,100
Thanks.

251
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,570
For my dad, strawberries are the best treat.

252
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,570
He's really treating you as special.

253
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,100
Do you like strawberries?

254
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,000
My mom

255
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,170
only craved strawberries
when she was pregnant with me.

256
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,700
But I guess he couldn't buy them often.

257
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,370
My mom likes strawberries too.

258
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,930
Wait, you're not going home?

259
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,570
Can't you tell by looking?

260
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,700
That's why I came here.

261
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,900
Have you eaten?

262
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,380
I'll make ramyeon.

263
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,200
But have you

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,830
ever tried things like ramyeon before?

265
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,700
Are you crazy?

266
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I thought people like you
didn't eat stuff like ramyeon.

267
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,930
Die, you wretch!

268
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,870
Who the hell are you!

269
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,530
Mess with her again and you're dead.

270
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,100
Get lost!

271
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,970
This is stalking.

272
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,270
I've recorded all your sneaky following around.

273
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,300
Leave voluntarily if you don't
want police to be involved.

274
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,600
Ah, darn it!

275
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Hye In, are you okay?

276
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,330
When I brought you home last time,

277
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,970
I saw Hwang Bo Seok.

278
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,170
I thought that might be the case.

279
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,500
I had no idea at all.

280
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,630
Thanks.

281
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,400
Just in case, I'll come tomorrow morning too.

282
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,930
No, I have someone to go with tomorrow.

283
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,670
I really appreciate your help.

284
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,200
Get home safe.

285
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Okay.

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,530
You go in first.

287
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,830
I want to see you go inside.

288
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,970
I'll go then.

289
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,070
Are you asleep?

290
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,870
No.

291
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,570
How should I live from now on?

292
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,030
You see me like this and still say that?

293
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,570
I just

294
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,900
wish someone would tell me the right answer.

295
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,530
What good are answers others give you?

296
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,630
People like you don't need that.

297
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,570
Your environment is different from mine.

298
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,770
What we can never have,

299
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,230
you already have everything.

300
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,670
Why do you keep thinking people
like us are special or different?

301
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,600
On the surface, it may seem that way.

302
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,570
Just because we have money doesn't
mean we lack worries or loneliness.

303
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,770
Everyone lives the same way.

304
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,870
Eat, shit, repeat...

305
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,430
But still...

306
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,100
Everyone's lives are similar.

307
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,930
It's just how they live that's different.

308
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,600
But, you

309
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,730
didn't do drugs, right?

310
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,870
Are you crazy?

311
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,800
Ha Min Hee must've switched it.

312
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,330
Then what about the drugs in your locker?

313
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,870
Min Yul Hee probably ordered it.

314
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,170
But...

315
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,730
What?

316
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,630
Never mind.

317
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,070
What? You stopped mid-sentence.

318
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,200
Stopping mid-sentence is your habit?

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,070
I

320
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,700
saw Min Yul Hee and Cha Jin Wook kissing.

321
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,470
- At school.
- What?

322
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,670
They kissed?

323
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,530
Min Yul Hee dragged him down,

324
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,630
and Cha Jin Wook seems to be trying something too.

325
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,130
Let them do as they please.

326
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,430
I

327
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,100
am going to get engaged to
Cha Jin Wook of Chasel Medic.

328
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,900
What?

329
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,300
What about Woo Jin?

330
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,100
I don't know. I'll break off the engagement.

331
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,000
Min Yul Hee, do you think
you can decide that on your own?

332
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,700
Plus, Hanmyeong's Baek Jenna is there.

333
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,770
I'm the one who ruined Baek Jenna.

334
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,030
That's why I'm trying to get
engaged to Cha Jin Wook.

335
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,700
Mom, just help me find a dress.

336
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,770
Why?

337
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,700
Honestly, compared to Park Woo Jin's hotel,

338
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,270
Chasel Medic is better.

339
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,870
You know how your mom and dad got married, right?

340
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,470
When you see something good,
you have to claim it fast.

341
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,130
Otherwise, someone else will take it.

342
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,870
Are you confident?

343
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,300
A few days ago,

344
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,400
when you bumped into me under the overpass,

345
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,670
what were you doing there?

346
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,200
Oh, that?

347
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,830
I'll tell you later.

348
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,330
That day, Oh Si Eun's phone

349
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,270
was snatched by someone.

350
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,900
What?

351
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,500
Who?

352
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,930
It's not certain yet,

353
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,730
but I think it's Park Woo Jin.

354
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,570
Park Woo Jin?

355
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,530
Why him?

356
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,370
He seems to be the culprit

357
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,030
in Oh Si Eun's case.

358
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,870
What?

359
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,500
What a psycho!

360
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,830
But,

361
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,170
what can you possibly do?

362
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,670
We have to fight.

363
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,230
Everything I have is at stake here.

364
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,800
Hey, we need to go this way.

365
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,970
You go ahead. I have somewhere else to be.

366
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,070
Hey!

367
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,400
Back in the day,

368
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,570
I used to wonder why you guys
never wore coats or paddings.

369
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,700
You just never needed to wear them,

370
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,130
because you're always riding in cars

371
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,100
