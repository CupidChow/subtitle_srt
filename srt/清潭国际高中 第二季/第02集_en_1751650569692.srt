1
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:39,033
[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,900
Ma'am.

3
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,600
<i>Now I understand.</i>

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,967
<i>This is my reality.</i>

5
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:03,967
<i>And this is my future</i>

6
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,049
<i>that will not change.</i>

7
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:20,033
I was wrong.

8
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:23,200
I was wrong.

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,633
<i>I don't want to live like this.</i>

10
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,833
I was wrong.

11
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,900
<i>Is being poor a crime?</i>

12
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>No.</i>

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,567
<i>I'll make having money a crime too.</i>

14
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,900
I will escort you home.

15
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,602
Okay.

16
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,776
[Baek Jenna is pretty, so she's unaffected.
What does being pretty have to do with it?]

17
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,933
[If you're pretty, do you get
to inherit the company?]

18
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,363
[It might be different if she were a son,
but she's a daughter, right?]

19
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,260
[Would they abandon her
just because she's a girl?]

20
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,133
Have you seen this?

21
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,300
Black Dog?

22
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,133
Black what?

23
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,733
Hello, this is Black Dog.

24
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,167
Today

25
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,400
I brought some very interesting news

26
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,267
and the complete summary about

27
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:23,567
romantic Chairman Baek Joo Won's

28
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,867
love affair.

29
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:25,900
[His mistress, whom he's been seeing
since the beginning of this year,]

30
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,100
[is the contract teacher, Ha Min Hee!]

31
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,433
Baek Jenna's father's lover is Ms. Ha Min Hee?

32
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,833
Ha Min Hee?

33
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,833
That contract English teacher Ha Min Hee?

34
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,667
Yes!

35
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,867
That's crazy! But how did he find out?

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,767
If the kid she's carrying is a boy,

37
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,933
is Baek Jenna done for now?

38
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,800
What to do? It hurts my heart.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,767
[Currently, she is 5 months pregnant,
and it's said to be a boy.]

40
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,533
[Seo Jae Kyung is an alcohol and drug addict.]

41
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,933
[Will the succession plan for the heir,
Baek Jenna, become unclear?]

42
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,800
If you're going to hide something,
you should hide it well…

43
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,133
Oh, no!

44
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,767
Jenna is watching too?

45
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,233
Is this your work too?

46
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,333
What? That Black Dog?

47
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,233
Are you crazy? We're not thugs.

48
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,333
Why would we do such a thing?

49
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:27,100
Does Baek Jenna also know
she should be embarrassed?

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,967
Exactly.

51
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,333
Who is this Black Dog guy?

52
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,200
Find him quickly!

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,367
Yes, I will look into it immediately.

54
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,967
I warned you, didn't I?

55
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:58,200
I won't tolerate any nonsense during my tenure!

56
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,233
You can't even handle one thing like this,

57
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,267
Mr. Kim Jin Seop…

58
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,633
Oh! Do Un, come in.

59
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,600
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,067
I told you to come say hello sooner.

61
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,667
When it's just the two of us, call me Uncle.

62
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,667
You're having a hard time because of your dad?

63
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,667
Don't worry,

64
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,367
nothing has changed.

65
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,967
I will protect you till the end.

66
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,033
If you're going through a tough time,
you have to tell me.

67
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,167
Stay strong and square your shoulders,

68
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,100
understood?

69
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,800
Yes, Uncle.

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
That's it.

71
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,833
A sigh is interpreted differently
by the one sighing and the person watching.

72
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,400
Someone else's sigh is seen as sadness,

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,133
while one's own sigh is seen as
despair, or something like that.

74
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,833
Anyway,

75
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,533
Baek Jenna and "despair"

76
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,467
don't go well together.

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,333
Apologize. I'll accept it.

78
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,467
Apologize?

79
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,767
Why should I?

80
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,167
<i>All you do is bully kids.</i>

81
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,933
<i>That's because you were being played
like an idiot, not knowing a thing!</i>

82
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,767
<i>- What did you say?
- Let's say Kim Hae In's poverty isn't a crime.</i>

83
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,100
<i>But what about her trying to extort money
from me, using her poverty as an excuse?</i>

84
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,667
<i>Do you think I was the only one?</i>

85
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,600
<i>He was being blackmailed too.</i>

86
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,533
<i>Kim Hae In slept with Park Woo Jin.</i>

87
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,067
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, come out.</i>

88
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,933
<i>Hey!</i>

89
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,433
Yeah, I didn't expect you'd apologize.

90
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
And Hae In

91
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,833
will wake up.

92
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,733
When that happens, I'll ask everything myself.

93
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,667
Do as you like.

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Are you okay?

95
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,467
What if I'm not?

96
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,900
Deep down, you're happy

97
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,267
that I've ended up like this, aren't you?

98
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

99
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,333
I'm worried about you.

100
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,700
Cute, isn't it?

101
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:44,733
Why are you here?

102
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,267
I moved in.

103
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,533
I was going to tell you beforehand,

104
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,867
but you wouldn't answer my calls.

105
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,567
You're hurting my feelings, Jenna.

106
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,300
You know that students are the busiest people.

107
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,833
But is there a reason you'd leave Hannam-dong

108
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,567
to come all the way here?

109
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,167
I'm not really into houses.

110
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,767
I like looking down from above.

111
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,733
Then enjoy the view, from above.

112
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,467
Jenna.

113
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,733
I decorated your brother's room.
Do you want to see it?

114
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,333
I think you once said

115
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,367
that used to be your mom's room.

116
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,233
How many empty rooms do you think there are here?

117
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:34,000
It's south-facing, so it gets great sunlight.

118
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:39,067
Parents should be in the room
right next to each other.

119
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,533
It's a problem if they're too far away.

120
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,367
No matter how much you hate it,

121
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,467
you have to accept it now.

122
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,633
You're going to have a younger brother.

123
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,900
You should act like a big sister,
be willing to compromise,

124
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,300
and share.

125
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,367
You are smart, Jenna.

126
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:02,167
You understand what I'm saying, right?

127
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,533
A younger brother?

128
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,733
Even if he's born, he'll just
be a half-rate life, won't he?

129
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,033
<i>I'm truly begging you like this.</i>

130
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:05,900
<i>If you could just give her another chance…</i>

131
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,867
<i>Please…</i>

132
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:27,633
<i>My daughter, I made some
delicious curry in the morning.</i>

133
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,733
<i>Make sure to have dinner at home.</i>

134
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,700
Here.

135
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,333
Sun Joo,

136
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,567
have you ever been sued?

137
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,367
Sued?

138
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,100
That jerk Hwang Bo Seok won't agree to settle?

139
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,200
Yeah.

140
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,867
That jerk said he'd sue me for school violence.

141
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,600
I am even investigated
because of the Oh Si Eun incident.

142
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,533
If the school violence case opens,

143
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,067
it'll be recorded on my school register,
and I'll be expelled.

144
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,500
What?

145
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,133
What about employment in the future?
My life will be over.

146
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,567
But

147
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,833
all of this

148
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:30,233
is because I didn't know my place
and entered Cheongdam International High School.

149
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,367
Is there any way out?

150
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:39,567
I've come this far.

151
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,900
I don't want to give up just like this.

152
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
And I don't want anything taken from me.

153
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,933
Right. You can't let them take anything.

154
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,500
You definitely can't give up.

155
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,967
There's only one way.

156
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,367
You have to get into the Diamond 6.

157
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,267
The Diamond 6 is above the law, you know.

158
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,900
Even if they commit a crime,
no one can touch them.

159
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,967
How am I supposed to get in there?

160
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,300
The way I see it,

161
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,900
you don't have any other options right now.

162
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,133
You can only get into the Diamond 6

163
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,267
and receive immunity.

164
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,846
Diamond 6?

165
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,733
Hello?

166
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,700
<i>Baek Jenna, it's me.</i>

167
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,567
<i>I have a favor to ask--</i>

168
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,267
No.

169
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,067
I want to make a deal.

170
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,633
My life is on the line. Let's meet now.

171
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,267
<i>But I can't now.</i>

172
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,267
I could

173
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,767
really end up dying.

174
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,967
<i>I can't go out right now.</i>

175
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,333
You either come to my house or…

176
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,100
To your house?

177
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,267
Are you crazy?

178
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,067
You want me to get you into the Diamond 6?

179
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,667
I'm not asking for a favor.

180
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,833
I'm proposing a deal.

181
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,233
A deal?

182
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,500
Do you have anything to propose a deal to me?

183
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,633
I'll give you

184
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,633
Min Yul Hee's necklace.

185
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,900
What can you do with that necklace?

186
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,567
Hey, Equal Opportunity Leech,

187
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,233
don't be mistaken.

188
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,633
Diamond 6?

189
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:28,433
You can never give me something
that matches that class.

190
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,600
I'll do anything.

191
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,033
Just help me this one time, please.

192
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,600
At this rate, my life is completely over.

193
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,567
Yeah, that…

194
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Equal Opportunity Leech.

195
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,933
You probably won't understand.

196
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,200
Because you live looking down
at the world from a place like this.

197
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,900
But as for me,

198
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,133
if I slip up even once, it's really over.

199
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,033
So,

200
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,567
just this one time.

201
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,970
Just once, please.

202
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,233
Just once.

203
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,300
Help me.

204
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,667
Do you know why I called you to my house?

205
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,167
So you could see

206
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,433
why we are different.

207
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,043
What?

208
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,567
If you're done talking, then leave.

209
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,598
You should say something that makes sense.

210
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,300
You crazy punk!

211
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,700
Are you threatening me right now?

212
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,067
Why are you so curious about

213
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,200
whether the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?

214
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,700
I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!

215
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,000
The heir of Hanmyeong Group.

216
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,433
Do you still not get it?

217
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,600
Wow! He's really handsome!

218
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,200
Hey, Baek Jenna!

219
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,800
If I bring something suitable,

220
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,700
we can make a deal, right?

221
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,233
Are you still talking about that?

222
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,552
Baek Jenna?

223
00:17:57,537 --> 00:18:00,033
I was curious,

224
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,606
but now that I've seen your face,

225
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,033
you pass.

226
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,867
Pass?

227
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,567
Who are you?

228
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,600
And while you're good enough now,

229
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,067
come a little prettier tomorrow.

230
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,867
Don't be late.

231
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:18,233
The elders don't like tardiness.

232
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,633
Ah.

233
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,233
Please continue your conversation.

234
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:26,667
What is that?

235
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,233
Hey!

236
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,033
Hey!

237
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,626
Who is that guy?

238
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,686
Stay there.

239
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,067
Jenna, they're hilarious.

240
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,567
They don't even greet you now?

241
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,999
You look terrible.

242
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,667
How is your mother doing?

243
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,767
She's really shocked, right?

244
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,400
But still, congratulations.

245
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,333
Even though it will be born out of infidelity,
a sibling is still a sibling.

246
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,600
Come to think of it,

247
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,733
isn't Ms. Min Hee really amazing?

248
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,700
For a contract teacher?

249
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,967
Didn't you understand what I said?

250
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,367
I believe I told you

251
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,967
I know who killed Kim Hae In.

252
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,634
Who died?

253
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:44,067
Kim Hae In didn't die, did she?

254
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>Don't you...</i>

255
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,800
<i>ever wake up.</i>

256
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:10,033
<i>The next time, I might really kill you.</i>

257
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,883
She's lying there like a corpse,

258
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,833
but she's not dead.

259
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,300
Keep that in mind.

260
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
You're the one who started it, right?

261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,467
One of us will end it.

262
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,600
Of course.

263
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,700
But it won't be me.

264
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,367
Dad, Dad.

265
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,767
Go inside and sleep.

266
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,833
Oh! My daughter is back?

267
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,367
- Go inside.
- Okay.

268
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:37,700
Alright, I'll sleep.

269
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:54,800
[Kim Hye In]

270
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,477
<i>Die!</i>

271
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,300
<i>Are you threatening me right now?</i>

272
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,267
<i>Are you threatening me right now?</i>

273
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:20,733
<i>Why are you so curious about whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?</i>

274
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,467
<i>I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!</i>

275
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,833
<i>The heir of Hanmyeong Group.</i>

276
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,033
<i>Do you still not get it?</i>

277
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,267
Hey, Kim Hye In?

278
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,167
Where are you?

279
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,133
What is it? Why did you suggest
meeting in such a creepy place?

280
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:58,800
You said you wanted to make a deal.

281
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,212
And no one should know about it.

282
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,533
You're dumber than I thought.

283
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,133
I told you, the necklace doesn't matter.

284
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,967
At least there should be some CCTV footage.

285
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,400
What will you do with this?

286
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:17,600
Really?

287
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,433
Then,

288
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,733
how about this?

289
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:32,900
<i>You crazy punk! Are you threatening me right now?</i>

290
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,467
<i>Why are you so curious about whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?</i>

291
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:38,833
<i>I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!</i>

292
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,133
<i>The heir of Hanmyeong Group.</i>

293
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,200
<i>Do you still not get it?</i>

294
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:52,650
How about it?

295
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,017
Isn't this enough for a deal?

296
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,825
I don't have time.

297
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:01,944
Will you take it or not?

298
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,733
The more I look at Jin Wook,

299
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,500
the more handsome he looks.

300
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Thank you.

301
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,333
He came from a good bloodline, right?

302
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,467
You take after your mom.

303
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,671
Why are you so late? We have an important guest.

304
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,933
Nice to meet you. We meet again.

305
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,500
Seeing the two of you like this,

306
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,400
I think we could set a wedding date right away.

307
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,100
Whose daughter is this?

308
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,367
You've raised her well.

309
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:03,067
Oh, you flatter me.

310
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,433
What do you think you're doing?

311
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,667
If I had known it was this kind of
meeting, I wouldn't have come.

312
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:10,700
- Jenna…
- How can you

313
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,267
go this far and be so selfish?

314
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,367
Sit down and talk.

315
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,133
Baek Jenna!

316
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,933
I'll go see what's wrong.

317
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,767
Sure.

318
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
I'm disappointed, Baek Jenna.

319
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:35,467
Get lost.

320
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,467
It's not like I'm thrilled about this situation,

321
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:41,433
getting married as soon as I come to Korea.

322
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,467
Marry?

323
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,967
But

324
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:47,000
it's not so bad that I'd scream about it.

325
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Don't you think?

326
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,633
It seems like you and I

327
00:26:56,633 --> 00:27:01,033
are both just pieces on a chessboard
laid out by those old folks.

328
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,367
I think we need to do some thinking

329
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,767
about...

330
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,300
whether we'll be pawns...

331
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,333
or if we'll move the pieces ourselves.

332
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,267
Don't we?

333
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,700
Could you please just get lost?

334
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
I also have my thoughts.

335
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,733
Oh, really?

336
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,833
I'm looking forward to it.

337
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,000
Chairman Baek?

338
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,867
He's so lost in his love affair

339
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:40,667
that he's raised his child like absolute trash.

340
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,333
You should be the one to tame her properly.

341
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,167
Yes, Father.

342
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:52,300
Do you know why I called you back?

343
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:56,067
You are different from your elder brothers.

344
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,000
You know that, right?

345
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,100
- Yes.
- You will have to

346
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,267
prove your abilities yourself.

347
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,200
Chairman Baek…

348
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,343
Yes.

349
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:31,024
Today, I had dinner with my father
and Chairman Baek of Hanmyeong Group.

350
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,333
Baek Jenna was there too.

351
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Don't worry, Mom.

352
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,667
You know that

353
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:46,300
I don't play games I'll lose, right?

354
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,400
And I think...

355
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,200
it's going to be quite fun.

356
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,100
Mr. Director,

357
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,800
didn't you make a promise to me?

358
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,400
As you requested, Jenna's
disciplinary action is being discussed.

359
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,631
But why is Baek Jenna still walking
around the school so confidently?

360
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:17,090
As her friend, you know it as well,

361
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,509
that Hanmyeong Group's sponsorship is the largest.

362
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:20,833
And Jenna is also

363
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,554
the only daughter of Hanmyeong Group.

364
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:27,113
The mistress of Chairman Baek
was a teacher at our school.

365
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,600
Furthermore, she got pregnant.

366
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:34,704
And his daughter, Baek Jenna, attends that school.

367
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:39,967
Don't you think this is enough
to convene an ethics committee?

368
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:44,233
Just issue the disciplinary action.

369
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:47,286
Then, I will proceed with the next steps myself.

370
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,800
I'll get Baek Jenna

371
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,464
kicked out

372
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,698
of Diamond 6.

373
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:12,867
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

374
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,900
Yul Hee just came by

375
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,800
and asked about your disciplinary action.

376
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,767
<i>This isn't a request from some commoner,</i>

377
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:24,867
so I can't keep pretending
I don't know about it, can I?

378
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,167
Let's talk more at school tomorrow.

379
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,767
I also have something urgent to discuss with you.

380
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,033
The moment the media finds out

381
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,933
Kim Hae In's incident was an attempted murder
and not a suicide, they'll go into a frenzy.

382
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:42,167
Wouldn't your position as
chairman be in jeopardy too?

383
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,200
So,

384
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,408
if I accept this?

385
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:51,833
Then my friends and I will graduate
quietly as if nothing happened,

386
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:55,900
and Hanmyeong will continue
to be your biggest sponsor.

387
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,700
Of course,

388
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,200
your position as chairman will remain unchanged.

389
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:06,400
Then I'll take that as your
acceptance and be on my way.

390
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,033
I'll leave this as a sign of trust.

391
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,467
When did you say

392
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,067
the Oh Si Eun case would be closed?

393
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,367
The investigation will be
concluded within this week.

394
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,533
What's the scenario?

395
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:31,967
<i>Hospital records show that student Oh Si Eun</i>

396
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,733
had been suffering from depression

397
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,733
and showed signs of suicide,
such as overdosing on tranquilizers.

398
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:39,667
<i>In particular, the bereaved family
does not want things to get noisy</i>

399
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,867
and has requested the case be closed quietly.

400
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,333
Wrap it up that way.

401
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,533
And erase all of Kim Hye In's
investigation records.

402
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,600
<i>Yes, I will handle it as soon as possible.</i>

403
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,267
Hello.

404
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,467
It's been a while, brothers and sisters.

405
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:12,500
Lee Sa Rang?

406
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,733
The youngest of Diamond 6!

407
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,733
It's Sa Rang.

408
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,567
So, you're the new member from the first years.

409
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:22,267
If everyone's here, let's just say what
we have to say and get this over with.

410
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:25,167
You must all be uncomfortable
being in the same space.

411
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,200
You're here early.

412
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,433
You've never seen me before, right?

413
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,067
My name is Cha Jin Wook,

414
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,433
a transfer student.

415
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,100
And

416
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,533
the new member of this club.

417
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,800
It's a pleasure.

418
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,067
Hey, Baek Jenna,

419
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,467
isn't it proper manners to tell us first

420
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:24,000
when you're recommending a new member?

421
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,900
There is a spot left by Lee Deok Min.

422
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,467
And I'm telling you just in case,

423
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,833
but I meet the basic requirements to join,

424
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,900
so you don't need to worry.

425
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,833
And

426
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,600
there will be one more new member coming.

427
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,567
What are you talking about?
There are no vacancies.

428
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,500
What are you doing, Baek Jenna?

429
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,233
One of the conditions for joining the Diamond 6

430
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:51,267
is a top-tier donation.

431
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,033
But isn't there someone among us

432
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,967
who hasn't paid the donation?

433
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:00,400
Seo Do Un.

434
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,500
I'm sorry,

435
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,667
but you'll have to leave.

436
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,467
What are you doing?

437
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,935
The new member of Diamond 6...

438
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,270
is Kim Hye In.
