1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Tub, that's Rak and his wife.

2
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,560
Luck is on our side.

3
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,800
- Help!
- Shut up, unless you want to get hurt.

4
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,520
If you're that stingy, I'll take it all.

5
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm here to congratulate you.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,080
I can't just sit by
and watch those three brothers succeed.

7
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,520
Get out!

8
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
If the one who inherited was Rak,

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
you would've stood up for him,
tried to mediate peace between us.

10
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,720
But it was me, the one you never loved.

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
Do you want to know what else Dad told me?

12
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,360
The invitation cards are ready.

13
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
We need to send them out quickly.

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,160
Let's just mail them all out.

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
For the VIPs,
we can follow up with a phone call.

16
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
All right.

17
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
Well, have you heard
about your younger brother?

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Which one?

19
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
Ronnakorn.

20
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,640
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

21
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,080
So you didn't end up visiting him?

22
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,720
Yeah.

23
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
I just wasn't in the right headspace.

24
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
Then the doctor came in,

25
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
so I just left.

26
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,040
But telling your mom everything
was the right move.

27
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,400
Sometimes proving things
with actions takes too long.

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,640
It's meaningless by then.

29
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,800
Saying anything at this point
doesn't matter either.

30
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,880
She's so biased against me.

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
She blames me

32
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,880
for tearing the family apart.

33
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
She says

34
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm trying
to take over all the businesses.

35
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
No matter what people think or say,

36
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
what you've done clearly shows

37
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
that your father made the right choice.

38
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,240
You're the one truly capable
of protecting this family's legacy.

39
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,480
But in another sense, it's a good thing

40
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,560
that Rak and Korn
have their own businesses now.

41
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200
Maybe it's a shortcut

42
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,560
to fulfilling what Dad wanted all along.

43
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,880
I hope so.

44
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
I really do.

45
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, sir?

46
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,040
Mr. Ronnakorn Trongpanich…

47
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,200
Yes, he's currently being treated here.

48
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,040
No, there's no brain injury.

49
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,720
Yes, he's safe now.

50
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Would you like me
to transfer the call to his room?

51
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,720
No, that's all right.

52
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,720
Thank you.

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,960
That's enough. I'm full.

54
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,560
You've barely eaten anything.
Just one more bite, please?

55
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,640
Please.

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
The more you listen to me,
the faster you'll heal.

57
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Here.

58
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,560
It's a bit sad, though.
None of your brothers have come to visit.

59
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,680
Not even a phone call. It's dead quiet.

60
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
Maybe they don't know I'm here.

61
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,360
Come on.

62
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,920
It's Madam Mei's precious son's bar.

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,160
I'm sure the whole town knows by now.

64
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,200
Money really does tear families apart.

65
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,800
You all seemed so close,

66
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,920
and then the will was read,
everyone went their separate ways.

67
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,640
It's sad

68
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
because you love
and care for your brothers.

69
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,840
But lucky for you,

70
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,240
you've still got me by your side.

71
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,640
I've been thinking
about what your mom said

72
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
about hiring someone
to watch over the bar.

73
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
I think

74
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
she's right.

75
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,520
All the bars in Bangkok
have someone for protection.

76
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,840
Ours should too,

77
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,640
to prevent
any more incidents like last night.

78
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,000
At least then you won't get hurt again.

79
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
But I don't know
where to find someone like that.

80
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,919
How about my brother?

81
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
He's family. He can be trusted.

82
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,480
And honestly, this kind of job suits him.

83
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,000
Muscle work, no brains required.

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,160
Are you sure he won't turn on me again?

85
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,920
He still might be holding
a grudge against me and Wee.

86
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,120
That was ages ago.
He barely remembers anything.

87
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,520
Just give him money and he'll be happy.

88
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,600
All right. Give it a try, then.

89
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,400
I will. Leave it to me.

90
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Now get some rest so you can heal quickly.

91
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,600
All right?

92
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,960
It got a little out of hand.

93
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,240
I meant to shake things up,
so he'd lose a few customers.

94
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,440
I didn't expect him
to fight back like that.

95
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,080
Feeling sorry for your brother now?

96
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
He's still Dad's son anyway.

97
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Have they ever thought of you that way?

98
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Whatever. I'm not that heartless.

99
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,760
Your appointment is here.

100
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
Let him in.

101
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,800
Who is it?

102
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Prakob.

103
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
What's going on?

104
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
Some documents leaked at the mill.

105
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
These are workers being blacklisted.
They're about to get fired.

106
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,360
These are all our people.

107
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
How'd they find out?

108
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,000
Now they're so terrified

109
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
they're barely doing their jobs.

110
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,040
Tell them to meet me this evening.

111
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,480
Will do, sir.

112
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,200
Would you like more tea, sir?

113
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,520
No need.

114
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,840
Boss.

115
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,440
Where are they? I've been waiting.

116
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,320
They betrayed you.

117
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,880
They're meeting with Mr. Rawee right now.

118
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,880
Rawee?

119
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,040
What happened with the rice mill guys?

120
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,320
Why such a sudden meeting?

121
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,320
Chen asked them to meet him.

122
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,200
They panicked and wanted to meet me first.

123
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,320
The news about what happened
with the hotel staff spread fast.

124
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,920
No one wants to get betrayed,
lose their pay,

125
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,680
or risk their job.

126
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,440
What did they ask for?

127
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,760
They want to switch sides and work for me.

128
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,040
Can we trust them?

129
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,920
They gave me proof that
Chen was embezzling money

130
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
from the mill.

131
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,400
It's clear

132
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,760
they're cutting ties with him.

133
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,400
Then maybe this whole mess
with the hotel and the mill

134
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,360
is finally ending.

135
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,800
Chen's probably furious.
I doubt he'll let this go.

136
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,400
I don't know what he'll do next.

137
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,560
That's enough.

138
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,640
Drinking won't change anything now.

139
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,280
I want to get drunk and forget.

140
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,320
Those ungrateful people.

141
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
Wasn't it because of me

142
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,280
that they're living comfortable lives
and have money now?

143
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
It's how the world works, dear.

144
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,600
We're out of power now.

145
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,920
‪Rawee took everything back.

146
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,760
If brains won't win this fight,

147
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,240
we'll have to use force.

148
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,000
Dad appointed Rak
as deputy manager to assist me

149
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,360
because Rak is impulsive.

150
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,280
He was spoiled growing up.

151
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,680
He always gets what he wants.

152
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,080
Even if he had good ideas,

153
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,280
Dad didn't think he could run the place.

154
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,280
Dad believed I had
more patience and empathy,

155
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,120
that I could guide the hotel
through this transition.

156
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,160
Then, once things stabilized,

157
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,000
Dad wanted me to step down

158
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,760
and let Rak take over.

159
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,520
- So that's what your dad told you?
- Yes.

160
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,040
And then what are you going to do?

161
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,760
Ranee and I

162
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,520
plan to start something of our own.
I'm not sure what yet.

163
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,600
Maybe a horse stable
at her family's place.

164
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
And why are you telling me this now?

165
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,800
You're trying to claim it all.

166
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,560
If I'd said it back then, would Rak
have accepted being my assistant?

167
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,480
Mom.

168
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,280
You know him better than anyone.

169
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,760
Saying it now is useless.

170
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,360
This family's already broken.

171
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
Everyone's gone their separate ways.

172
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,400
Is this what your dad wanted?

173
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,720
I don't see anyone benefiting
more than you and your wife.

174
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,400
Your brothers stepped aside.

175
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Everything played out
just like you planned.

176
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Go ahead, enjoy it while it lasts.

177
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,560
You really
didn't trust Rak that much, did you?

178
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,960
He's the eldest son.

179
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
None of this sibling fighting
would have happened

180
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,520
if you'd just listened to me.

181
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,480
You overthought everything,

182
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,080
cared more about the business
than your own children's feelings.

183
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
The business is still standing,

184
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,920
but the family is falling apart.

185
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,560
Is this really what you wanted?

186
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,360
Rak opened his store
and didn't even invite us.

187
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,600
Even if he had, I wouldn't have gone.

188
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,920
I've had enough. Too disappointed.

189
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
At the bar opening,

190
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,320
Korn didn't welcome you, did he?

191
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,960
There were a lot of guests.

192
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,480
Maybe he didn't see me.

193
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,200
I knew it.

194
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
He was rude the last time I saw him too.

195
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,280
But for the cinema opening,

196
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,120
I want to invite all of Dad's sons,

197
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,120
including Chen, if that's okay with you?

198
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,680
Why would I mind? I'd be happy.

199
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,800
I think every one of Dad's sons
should be there to celebrate his dream.

200
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
I'm glad to hear that.

201
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,600
But don't get your hopes up
that they will all show up.

202
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
I don't want you
to be disappointed like I was.

203
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
Everyone.

204
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,800
We've got

205
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,840
special launch-day offers for you.

206
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,320
These are custom-designed.
You won't find them anywhere else.

207
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,960
First, diamond earrings,

208
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,520
chic for everyday wear.

209
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,800
Second, a simple diamond ring

210
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,000
which you can wear casually

211
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,840
or to events.

212
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,640
And third,

213
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,360
a full diamond set,

214
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,040
necklace, earrings, bracelet.

215
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,160
Truly elegant.

216
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,280
Isn't it nice? Please have a look.

217
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,840
If no one buys that set,

218
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm sure it'll be yours.

219
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,200
You really know me.

220
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,640
I have to give them
their first order as a good start.

221
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,360
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,520
Feel free to browse.

223
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
We're offering

224
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
25% off today only!

225
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,360
The special price is just for today.

226
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,320
There are only three sets available.

227
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,640
First come, first served.

228
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm interested.

229
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,400
Isn't that Chanraem and her husband?

230
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,520
It is.

231
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,360
Look at them. Dressed up
like they don't know their place.

232
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,840
They're all so beautiful.

233
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
Which one would you like?

234
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,560
We've got smaller pieces if you prefer.

235
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,680
I don't want my neighbors
to embarrass themselves.

236
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,680
We'll take this one.

237
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,520
Still 25% off, right?

238
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,360
You don't even know the price yet.

239
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,240
This should be enough.

240
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,800
Why didn't you tell me
there was a room up here?

241
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,360
I stayed with her for so long.

242
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,360
Madam.

243
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,840
I don't know
where she got that money from.

244
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,160
Even after buying diamonds,

245
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,800
she still had a pile of cash left.

246
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
Where would people like them

247
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,360
make money?

248
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,680
They probably just won the lottery.

249
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,080
I don't know what they're up to, Mom.
I don't like it.

250
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,680
Ignore them.

251
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Chanraem

252
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,800
is just flaunting her wealth,

253
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,560
trying to show she's fine

254
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,760
without marrying you.

255
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,080
I hope that's all it is.

256
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
Didn't you see?

257
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,600
She was posing for pictures,

258
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,880
collecting business cards.

259
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,080
It's all just a show.

260
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,160
The place is cozy, Young Master.

261
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,440
You've got good taste.

262
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,680
Duangporn and I live on the third floor.

263
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,960
I fixed this floor up especially for you.

264
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,840
In case you miss me

265
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,520
or your future grandchild.

266
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,800
I know you. You want me to babysit.

267
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,080
You always see through me, Mom.

268
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,440
You're the only one

269
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,440
who never forgets me,

270
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,800
no matter what.

271
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,840
You're the only mother I've got.
How could I?

272
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,880
With words like that,

273
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,280
who wouldn't love you, Young Master?

274
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,600
That madam was there.

275
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,320
Would Rawee find out
we went back on our word?

276
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,040
We just came to shop, not to kill them.

277
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,480
Besides, we moved out
of the province like he asked.

278
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,400
What more does he want?

279
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,880
That's true. Mr. Rawee can't be mad at us.

280
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,600
He gave us a taste of luxury.

281
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,480
No way I'm going back to being broke.

282
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,680
There's money right under our noses.

283
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,920
Only a fool would walk away.

284
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,600
Did you get enough contacts?

285
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,920
Just missing her group of friends.

286
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,880
What about the photos?

287
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,120
I arranged with the photographer.

288
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,800
He'll get the photos developed.

289
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,600
This investment is totally worth it.

290
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,960
We got money and revenge.

291
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,440
That's a win.

292
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
They're probably losing sleep
wondering why we showed up

293
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,520
and where the money came from.

294
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,680
After what they did to me,

295
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,800
as long as I'm alive,

296
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
they'll never have peace.

297
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
It's nothing.

298
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,680
Don't tell anyone I called.

299
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,000
I gotta go.

300
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,160
Who were you calling?

301
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,640
Home.

302
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,040
Mom really went
to Rak's store opening in Bangkok.

303
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
What a bond.

304
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Forget about them.

305
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,720
As long as I love you,
that's all that matters.

306
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
I've packed everything.

307
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,880
Let's go home.

308
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,840
Stand up slowly.

309
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,960
Let's stop by the bar first.

310
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,760
I want to reopen as soon as I can.

311
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Of course.

312
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,240
Mr. Rawee,

313
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,720
can I speak with you?

314
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,960
Sure. What is it?

315
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,200
The clients canceled

316
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,320
all banquet room bookings for this month.

317
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,280
- All of them?
- Yes, all.

318
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,880
They're forfeiting their deposits?

319
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,240
There were no deposits.

320
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,840
What? How did they book without deposits?

321
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,240
They were Mr. Chen's clients.

322
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,080
I want a full list of all those bookings.

323
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,280
Yes, sir.

324
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,760
Be careful.

325
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,800
Chat.

326
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,720
Why did you get here so early?

327
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,600
My sister called, so I came running.

328
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,560
I heard everything, little bro.

329
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,600
I can see how much you love my sister,

330
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,760
opening a bar for her and all that.

331
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,560
Let's leave the past

332
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
in the past.

333
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
Chat,

334
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,480
you can't call him little bro.

335
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,080
He's the owner now,
with a staff and everything.

336
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,720
The staff won't respect him.

337
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,840
Then what should I call him?

338
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,480
He's the Master, of course.

339
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,360
Sure.

340
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,640
I look forward to working with you,
Master Korn.

341
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,240
Help me take care of the bar.

342
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,680
Don't let that thing happen again.

343
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,400
I don't want to lose customers.

344
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
Don't worry, Master.

345
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,680
But the salary I asked for

346
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,320
is okay, right?

347
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,400
Chat, I already told you on the phone.

348
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,680
Thanks, Master.

349
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,760
I'll give it my all.

350
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,680
Mr. Korn still can't walk properly yet.
I'll show you around myself.

351
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Have a seat here first.

352
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,000
I'll be back.

353
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,640
This way.

354
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,000
Excuse me, Master.

355
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,000
- Chat! That hurts!
- Hey.

356
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,720
If that rich guy agreed to marry you,

357
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,080
you'd have ditched me.

358
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,520
Come on,

359
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,680
If I was gonna dump you,
why would I call you here?

360
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,400
Let me go. It hurts.

361
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,280
You better not be lying.

362
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,560
Hey.

363
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,680
Come on. This bar's doing great.

364
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
That's why I brought you here.

365
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
Fifty-fifty split like always?

366
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,080
Yeah, yeah. Your money's your money.

367
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,080
Hey. I know where he keeps the gold.

368
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,720
Really?

369
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,760
Yes. It's the first time in my life

370
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,400
I saw gold bars like that.

371
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Let's milk the bar first,

372
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,040
then when it's time to vanish,
we take the gold with us.

373
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,920
I really picked a hell of a woman.

374
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Hey, no. You can't.

375
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,800
Chill.

376
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,640
You don't have to worry
about anything, Manager.

377
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,680
Just focus on picking out
a gorgeous outfit

378
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
for the event.

379
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,840
All right.

380
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,880
Another stomach cramp?

381
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,360
Yeah…

382
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,560
You should really see a doctor

383
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,600
and get checked.

384
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,880
You've been overworking yourself lately.

385
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
Ranee.

386
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,720
Don't tell Mr. Rawee.

387
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,360
I don't want him to stop me from working.

388
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,960
Are you ready to go home?

389
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,760
Yes.

390
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,360
I already sent out
the invitations to all your brothers.

391
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
They should receive them in a few days.

392
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,120
Thanks.

393
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
Dad would be so happy

394
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,800
if everyone could come together again.

395
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,320
RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

396
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,760
What did you just throw away?

397
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,760
The invitation to the cinema opening.

398
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,719
I know you're not going.

399
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,639
That was just to taunt us.

400
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,639
Or maybe they want us to crash the event?

401
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,840
They picked the wrong people.

402
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
They dared invite you.

403
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,960
But it's right near our bar anyway.

404
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,440
I'm curious to see

405
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,960
if that woman can actually pull this off.

406
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,440
Are you going?

407
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,800
Don't go.

408
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,360
Going would mean
accepting them as the cinema managers.

409
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,040
Oh, Madam.

410
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,760
Are you going
to the cinema opening tonight?

411
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,120
Why would I go?

412
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,720
Oh, the colors you're wearing
looked like the theme.

413
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,760
I just threw this on.

414
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,280
I haven't worn it in ages.

415
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,520
What kind of silly idea is this?

416
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,720
People are kind enough to attend,

417
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,480
and now she wants them
to wear specific colors?

418
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,480
This is Thailand,
not some Western country.

419
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
Who would do that?

420
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,280
Oh.

421
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,120
If no one shows up,

422
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,240
I'll be the first to laugh.

423
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,280
What movie are they showing anyway?

424
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,000
<i>Deserted Paradise.</i>

May I get a quick interview?

431
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
Good evening.

432
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,320
Ms. Nida, do you think
this film will be a success?

433
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,080
This is the first cinema in the province.

434
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,840
No one's really coming for Dad?

435
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Are there a lot of people?

436
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,320
I'm not going. I don't like it.
It's a waste of my sleep.

437
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,320
Isn't it good?

438
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,760
Why did you leave so early?

439
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,280
<i>It's great!</i>

440
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,680
<i>They even invited actors from Bangkok.</i>

441
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,720
<i>I came home just to change</i>
<i>into sea-blue like everyone else.</i>

442
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,280
<i>I'm heading back later.</i>

443
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,440
Well.

444
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,400
Did you see my sons? Who showed up?

445
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,720
<i>I only saw Rawee.</i>

446
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,920
<i>Anyway, I gotta go.</i>
<i>I need to go take photos.</i>

447
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,760
All right.

448
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,640
I'M GOING TO THE CINEMA OPENING

449
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
All that big talk,

450
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,320
and in the end, he caved again.

What about your wife?

454
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I came alone.

455
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,480
What are you doing out here?
Why not go inside?

456
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,160
What about you?

457
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,360
Why are you here?

458
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,560
Why don't you go inside?

459
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,480

Thank you.

472
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,600
I'm going to take a short break.
Please enjoy another singer.

473
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,520
Don't take too long. I'll miss you.

474
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,200
Don't leave just yet, okay?

475
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,440
See you in a bit.

476
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,640
Hey!

477
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,040
Wait! What are you doing?

478
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,680
Isn't it obvious?

479
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,680
What if Korn sees us?

480
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,920
He's not here.
He went to the cinema opening event.

481
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,720
I don't have much time.
I have to sing again soon.

482
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,200
Then I'll just have to be quick.

483
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,280
I'm heading out.

484
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,240
Are you going back to the bar?

485
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,240
Yeah.

486
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,080
Maybe I'll stop by,

487
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,880
if it hasn't failed yet.

488
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,240
Even if it does, it's all my money,

489
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,680
not like you,
who's got Mom propping you up.

490
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,680
I've put in a lot too.

491
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,000
I didn't get
a divine inheritance like Rawee.

492
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,880
Why are you here?

493
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,960
For the cinema opening, of course.

494
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,520
Get out of here!

495
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,480
I was invited.
You have no right to kick me out.

496
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,400
I won't let you wreck this place

497
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,960
like you did with my bar.

498
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,480
Watch your mouth.

499
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,000
I took you to the hospital, remember?

500
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,040
You're ungrateful.

501
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,200
Who's the real ungrateful one here?

502
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,720
- Korn!
- Are you gonna hit me?

503
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,960
Do it!

504
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,120
Show everyone what a coward you are.

505
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,080
That's enough, everyone's watching.

506
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,160
You don't understand. Stay out of it.

507
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,360
If you're here to mess up Dad's event,

508
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,040
you'll have to get through me first.

509
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,040
- Are you trying to start a fight with me?
- Chen!

510
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,800
Tickets are being handed out.
Please head over.

511
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,000
I believe Dad's spirit

512
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,440
is here with us tonight.

513
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,440
He must be so proud

514
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,320
that his dream of building

515
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,280
the province's first cinema came true.

516
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,600
But I think what would make him happiest…

517
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,400
is seeing his four sons

518
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,880
all here, together.

Which one?

530
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,640
<i>The cinema manager.</i>

531
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,680
Ranee? What did she do?

532
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,040
Cha-aim, where's Ranee?

533
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,640
Oh? She didn't tell you?

534
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,800
No. I woke up, and she was gone.

535
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,920
Madam Mei called her over.

536
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,280
I don't know why.

537
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,640
You don't know Madam Keaw?

538
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,400
I do.

539
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,000
Then why didn't you
let her into the cinema?

540
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,520
It was completely full.

541
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,600
It was just three of them.

542
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Why couldn't you find any seats?

543
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,640
You could have just kicked
some random kids out.

544
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,440
I couldn't.

545
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,080
The invitation stated clearly
that if you wanted to watch the movie,

546
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,480
you had to reserve in advance.

547
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,280
Don't be so rigid.

548
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,560
I call it being fair to all guests.

549
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,600
Do you realize

550
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,600
how many factories Madam Keaw owns?

551
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,720
How many employees she has?

552
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,320
If she tells her employees

553
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,080
not to go to the cinema,

554
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,640
how much you'll lose?

555
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,560
She's your friend. She wouldn't do it.

556
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,920
She's right, ma'am.

557
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
I don't care.

558
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,880
You're going to bring her
a fruit basket and apologize.

559
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,960
Go today.

560
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,880
Okay. I'll go now.

561
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh! Ms. Ranee!

562
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,160
What happened?

563
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,920
Ms. Ranee?

564
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,080
What's wrong?

565
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,240
Ngor, get Prajak!

566
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
Yes, ma'am.

567
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,680
Prajak! Prajak!

568
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,400
Ranee? Ranee?

569
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,680
Do you hear me? Ranee?

570
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,600
My dear.

571
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,920
She took her meds and fell asleep.

572
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,480
Young Master, I'm sorry.

573
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,400
Mom called her in to yell again?

574
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,920
That's too harsh.

575
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,760
She just complained
about last night's event.

576
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,440
Was it that urgent?

577
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,720
Did she have to call her
that early in the morning?

578
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,200
She'd been working nonstop for months.
The event just ended.

579
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,600
Couldn't she rest for one day?

580
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,520
I don't know…

581
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,720
I'll go ask Mom myself.

582
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,400
Young Master…

583
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,360
I'm going now. Excuse me.

584
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,760
<i>You're going to bring her</i>
<i>a fruit basket and apologize.</i>

585
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,920
Go today.

586
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,840
I thought you couldn't live here.

587
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,320
What are you doing here?

588
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,560
Do you even realize what you've done?

589
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,560
I do.

590
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,880
Your wife bled here.

591
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,360
I took your wife to the hospital.

592
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,000
Didn't you realize

593
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,320
how much she'd been working
to prepare for the opening event?

594
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,240
Couldn't she rest for just a day?

595
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,360
So now you're blaming me
for the miscarriage?

596
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,160
How weak!
She miscarried just from being scolded?

597
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,080
Even if I didn't call her,

598
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,600
sooner or later,

599
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,640
she would've miscarried anyway.

600
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,480
Let me tell you.

601
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
It's your fault.

602
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,640
Why did you let her run the cinema?

603
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,680
You should've given it to Korn.

604
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,880
Your brother wouldn't have had
to waste his money opening the bar

605
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,600
and have gotten hurt.

606
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,600
And your wife wouldn't have miscarried.

607
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,920
Here we go again.

608
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,760
Of course.

609
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,440
It's your greed that caused all this.

610
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,000
Congratulations, then.

611
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,560
Your first grandchild

612
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,760
is Rak's, just like you wanted.

613
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,480
Have you considered a political career?

614
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,160
I'm not much of a talker.
I don't think I could handle it.

615
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,080
Bancha's trying to get Korn into politics.

616
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,080
Korn?

617
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,440
- Aren't you going to warn him?
- What for?

618
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,800
<i>If he gets conned and loses money,</i>

619
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,920
<i>that's his bad luck.</i>

620
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,720
<i>How many guests have canceled so far?</i>

621
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,160
<i>Nearly half.</i>

622
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,120
If this keeps up,
we're in serious trouble.

623
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,760
You've been scammed. These are fakes.

624
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,440
How dare you
try to trick us with fake jewelry!

625
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,080
When will you shut up?!

626
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,960
I said I didn't go to a brothel!

627
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Stop, Rak.

628
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,120
Mom!

629
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,400
