1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
What's the special occasion?

2
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,880
The occasion is just because I wanted to.

3
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Caught red-handed.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
It was you stabbing me in the back!

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
Happy birthday.

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>I remember all your birthdays.</i>

7
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,760
I remember so I can curse her.

8
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,160
I hope you all rot in Hell

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
<i>for what you did to me</i>

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,600
and my family.

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,560
<i>Fight fire with fire. He hurt me badly,</i>
<i>and it was on my birthday.</i>

12
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,160
<i>So what kind of bomb should we use?</i>

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
<i>All right, let's do it at noon today.</i>

14
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,600
Police are now searching
for the explosive.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,080
Please come out now.

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,800
You can have three bars. That's enough.

17
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
She's taking forever.

18
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
Hurry up.

19
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,960
- Hurry up.
- I know.

20
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
‪How did it go?

21
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,520
- How did it go?
- Jeez, do you want the gold or not?

22
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Hurry up.

23
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Here.

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,680
There were six bars left.
We split them half and half.

25
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
Guess he used the rest to pamper the girl.

26
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,600
Better than leaving empty-handed.

27
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,400
Did you take three?

28
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,400
I think someone's following us.

29
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
Seriously?

30
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,080
Could it be the thugs who are after you?

31
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,680
- Police?
- Police?

32
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,000
What do we do?

33
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
All right.

34
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,320
Dead end?

35
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,920
- Police? I'm outta here!
- Chome!

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Chome!

37
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
- Chome!
- I'm leaving.

38
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Mr. Chat!

39
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,080
Surrender and step out of the car.

40
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,640
Slowly.

41
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,880
Damn it.

42
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,440
Clear.

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
Chat…

44
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Korn?

45
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,280
Are you trying to kill me?

46
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,560
<i>Now you don't have to worry anymore.</i>

47
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,880
<i>The police neutralized Chat.</i>

48
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>That guy had a long rap sheet.</i>

49
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
<i>As for your singer girlfriend,</i>

50
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,520
<i>she ran,</i>
<i>but I doubt she'll ever come back.</i>

51
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,920
Still, I won't feel at ease
until we catch Chome.

52
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,720
<i>I'll ask the police to keep an eye out.</i>

53
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you
for coordinating with the police for me.

54
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,680
<i>We're all in this together.</i>

55
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,600
<i>Oh, and the police</i>
<i>recovered the gold bars.</i>

56
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,160
<i>You can go claim them now.</i>

57
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,720
All right. Thank you.

58
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
What kind of joke is this?

59
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,440
What joke? I'm selling inherited gold.

60
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,720
Did someone scam you?
Or are you trying to scam me?

61
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
If you're not buying,
I'll sell somewhere else.

62
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,160
You've never handled
real gold bars before, have you?

63
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
The weight's off.

64
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,040
It's just gold-plated,
probably silver inside.

65
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,480
Do you want me to cut it open?

66
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,840
No way you're cutting my gold!

67
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,840
If it's real, I'll definitely buy it.

68
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,440
So?

69
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
You little brat. You tricked me.

70
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,120
You think you can cast me
out of your life that easily?

71
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,240
Not a chance.

72
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,040
We're here.

73
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,880
R&D JEWELRY
50% DISCOUNT STOREWIDE

74
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,080
The location's nice. Pretty visible.

75
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
If he hadn't been scammed,
this place wouldn't have gone under.

76
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Why's the door unlocked?

77
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,680
Wait.

78
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,480
Rak.

79
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,480
Rak.

80
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,440
Rak.

81
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,560
We can't leave him like this.
There's no one to look after him.

82
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,320
Will he even agree to come home?

83
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,920
He feels humiliated.

84
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll convince him
to come back to work at the hotel.

85
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,920
Good thing he's drunk.

86
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Otherwise,
you'd have been kicked out already.

87
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
I expected that.

88
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,360
But I had to come,
so he'd know we siblings care

89
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
and never give up on each other.

90
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,720
Well.

91
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,320
Tell Mom for me

92
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,280
to send someone to check on him.

93
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,120
We can't leave him alone like this.

94
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,280
Okay.

95
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,520
I'll make him something to eat.

96
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,040
He'll be hungry when he wakes up.

97
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,560
Thanks.

98
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,840
How long is he planning
to use our hotel as his personal office?

99
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,640
Hopefully, he'll repay us well.

100
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,720
I'm off now. I'm going to pick up the ring
and stop by the gold shop.

101
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,360
See you this evening.

102
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
- Good day, sir.
- Have a seat.

103
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Thank you.

104
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,880
Hope you're doing well.

105
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,880
Thanks for coming all this way.

106
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,120
It's nothing, sir.

107
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,000
I got quite a batch,
so I thought I'd sell them off.

108
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,760
Hot goods? Afraid of getting burned?

109
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,120
You love teasing me, sir.

110
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Anyway,

111
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,120
are you planning
to give these to your girls this time?

112
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,880
No.

113
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm just preparing some wedding gifts
for an acquaintance.

114
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,960
You called at the right time.

115
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,960
I brought lots of sets
for you to choose from.

116
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,840
It fits perfectly.
It felt a bit tight before.

117
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,120
That's how it is with well-off people,

118
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,960
plump and glowing.

119
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Just say I've gained weight.
I won't be mad.

120
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
It's beautiful.

121
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,720
Hello, Ms. Duangporn.

122
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,720
What a coincidence, Big Sister-in-Law.

123
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,640
Oh, no, that's all in the past now.

124
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,560
Hey, why did you have to file for divorce?

125
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Businesses can fail. It's normal.

126
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,880
You should've given
your husband another chance.

127
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,360
- I'm here for--
- Or…

128
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,840
was it something else
that pushed you over the edge?

129
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,680
Don't tell me he hasn't changed.

130
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,880
Did he seduce the housemaid again?

131
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,160
Meddling in other people's lives
is fun for you, huh?

132
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,600
That hurts!

133
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,640
Your husband isn't any better.

134
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,840
He was born out of a mistake.

135
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,560
Not only does he leech off others,

136
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,040
but he also bites the hand that feeds him.

137
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,720
He stole money to build a hotel
and compete with his dad.

138
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,920
Ungrateful!

139
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,160
And if you're with him, you're no better.

140
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,480
Right?

141
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,800
I didn't say a word.

142
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,240
I came to tell you to stop sending people

143
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,520
to collect debt at my house.

144
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,440
I'm divorcing him.

145
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,040
Go after Madam Mei and her son instead.

146
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,600
Yes, yes.

147
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,840
That's all I came to say.

148
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,760
I'm back in town.
You'd better stay out of my way.

149
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,800
If I see you again, I'll slap you flat.

150
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,160
- Hello?
- <i>You're still alive?</i>

151
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,040
Do I really have to die
before you'll forgive me?

152
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,160
<i>Yes.</i>

153
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,240
<i>Stop drinking yourself</i>
<i>to death for one day</i>

154
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
<i>and come back to sign the divorce papers.</i>

155
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,000
The kids are so eager.

156
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,000
Maybe we adults should just set
the wedding date already.

157
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,760
Sure. I have no objections.

158
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,000
We can do a Thai or Chinese ceremony,
whatever works.

159
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,680
Perfect. I have no problem.

160
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Looks like he's finally getting
the son-in-law he wanted.

161
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,080
Yes.

162
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,280
Let's eat.

163
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,720
These two are a match.

164
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,560
Their stars are aligned.

165
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,600
Please give us a few good dates
for the wedding.

166
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480
- Sure.
- Thank you.

167
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,280
No good Chinese date?
Then let's go with a Thai ceremony first.

168
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,120
The feng shui master said
this year's not a good time.

169
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Why rush it?

170
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,800
Tip's family's fortune-teller
already picked a date.

171
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,760
And who's that fortune-teller?

172
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,960
You don't trust them. They don't trust
our feng shui master either.

173
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,560
So you're really set
on getting married next month?

174
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,080
Yes. It's perfect.

175
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,480
The boyfriend
of the district chief's daughter

176
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,360
is very different
than his son-in-law, Mom.

177
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
Fine, I won't argue. Do what you want.

178
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,760
Mom.

179
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
When a better date comes up,
we can do a Chinese ceremony too.

180
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,760
Help me pick out the wedding jewelry.

181
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,160
Mr. Bancha gave me wedding gifts.

182
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,200
He gave me three sets to choose from.

183
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Please help me choose. I can't decide.

184
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Here.

185
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,760
I like this set.

186
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,440
Do you?

187
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,560
Wow.

188
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
If no one buys this big set,

189
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,400
I think it'll be yours.

190
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,480
Who gave this to you?

191
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,640
Mr. Bancha. He's my campaign supporter.

192
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,480
Where did he get it?

193
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I don't know. Why?

194
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,560
If I'm not mistaken,

195
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,960
this came from Rak's store.

196
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,200
Chanraem and Tub bought it.

197
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,360
How did it end up with him?

198
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,160
Take this set.

199
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,080
Duangporn, can you come to my house?

200
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Rak's not here now.

201
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,160
But can you come over now?

202
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,640
I'm asking you.

203
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,880
Go sign the divorce papers.

204
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,960
If she sues,

205
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,120
we'll lose more than just this.

206
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,600
Don't worry
that you won't find a new wife.

207
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,040
I'll find one for you.

208
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,040
Someone richer
and prettier than Duangporn.

209
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,320
There are plenty of them. Go.

210
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,840
No need, Mom.

211
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,840
Maybe…

212
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
I'm just meant to be alone.

213
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,320
MR. RAK TRONGPANICH

214
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
So, have you thought about

215
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,600
what to do if they really build a factory

216
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
next to our hotel?

217
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,600
We can't let that happen.

218
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,800
Mr. Rawee.

219
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Yes, Cha-aim?

220
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,440
- Someone's here to see you.
- Who is it?

221
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm not allowed to say.
You'll have to see for yourself.

222
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,480
Who is it?

223
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,960
Long time no see, Bro.

224
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,680
Are you doing well?

225
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,640
And you?

226
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,920
I'm all right, physically.

227
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,320
But not so much emotionally.

228
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,960
I'm getting married.

229
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,120
I'm happy for you.

230
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,040
You know

231
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,280
the bride isn't Chomechawee, right?

232
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,080
I heard some rumors.

233
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,280
Korn,

234
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,600
are you sure about this political path?

235
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
It's too late to back out now.

236
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,440
And…

237
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,640
are you planning to invite Rak?

238
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,760
I already did.

239
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,520
What are you doing here?

240
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,760
Delivering this.

241
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,840
Mom already told me.

242
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
You're doing a Thai-style wedding?

243
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,560
Congratulations. But I…

244
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
I want you at my wedding.

245
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,480
I'm starting a new life.

246
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
I want you to pour the ceremonial water

247
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,560
and give me your blessing.

248
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,880
You know I just got divorced.

249
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,520
The store's gone under.

250
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,760
My life is a mess.
What blessing could I give?

251
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
But you're my brother.

252
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,040
Whether you succeed

253
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
or fail…

254
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,120
nothing can ever change that.

255
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,280
I'll be waiting for your blessing.

256
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
See you at the wedding.

257
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,680
WE ARE PLEASED TO INVITE YOU TO HONOR US
WITH YOUR PRESENCE AT THE WEDDING CEREMONY

258
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,280
OF MS. TIPSUDA SUANSAWAN
AND MR. RONNAKORN TRONGPANICH.

259
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,960
Don't worry.

260
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,920
I'll drag Rak there myself

261
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,640
if I have to.

262
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,520
But don't pretend you don't see me

263
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,000
like you did at the bar that night.

264
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,240
I've missed you and Rak so much.

265
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,440
Don't ever do that to me again.

266
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,920
The water-pouring ceremony is
at ten o'clock.

267
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,120
Your wish

268
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,560
is finally coming true.

269
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,720
The three brothers

270
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,560
are coming together again.

271
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,240
Ranee…

272
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
shouldn't have told you that.

273
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,480
You embarrassed?

274
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
Well, yeah.

275
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,160
Just a little.

276
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,040
See you at the wedding.

277
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
WEDDING CEREMONY
TIPSUDA AND RONNAKORN

278
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,080
What are you doing here?

279
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
I came to pick you up for Korn's wedding.

280
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,160
No need. I can go myself.

281
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,880
I thought you wouldn't go,
so I came to get you.

282
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,480
Honestly, I didn't want to go.

283
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,920
But since he came here himself,

284
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,080
I didn't want to turn him away.

285
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,400
Then let's go together, in my car.

286
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,800
I'll drive.

287
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,920
Let's go.

288
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,600
I've got my own car.

289
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
I'll drive myself.

290
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,560
Bro.

291
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,480
You think you can be happy without me?

292
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,720
Dream on.

293
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,560
I got up at dawn for this.

294
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
You really want me to go back alone?

295
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,280
You're playing favorites.
That hurts, you know.

296
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,560
Stop acting like my little sister.

297
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,840
If we're going, let's go already.

298
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,240
All right then. Let's go!

299
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,000
- All right.
- Let's go!

300
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,200
Good morning!

301
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,760
The groom's procession is
at the district chief's house.

302
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,040
What are you doing here?

303
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,680
I was too shy to go stand there alone.

304
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,880
Where's your husband?

305
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,640
Don't tell me he's tricking his brother

306
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,880
and refusing to come.

307
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,720
This is his brother's
one and only wedding.

308
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,680
He went to pick up Rak.

309
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,080
Why?

310
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,640
He was worried Rak wouldn't show up.

311
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,000
He's probably too drunk to make it.

312
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,800
Wait and see. He'll be late again.

313
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,040
So, no big brothers
will come to the wedding.

314
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,200
If you're coming with us, hop in.
We'll miss the auspicious hour otherwise.

315
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,760
I'm handing the hotel manager role
back to you like Dad wanted.

316
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,240
Dad thought I was more diplomatic,

317
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,400
that I could guide the hotel
through its transition better,

318
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,400
so he wanted you to be my assistant first.

319
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,840
But once everything's stable,
I'll step aside.

320
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,440
Dad told you that?

321
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah.

322
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,040
Everyone's just mad at me and Dad.
No one listens.

323
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
Ranee's giving the cinema back to Korn.

324
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,960
But only if he can handle it
along with politics.

325
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,680
So if you and Ranee
are giving everything up to me and Korn,

326
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
what will you two do?

327
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,800
The rice mill already has a manager.

328
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,440
We're thinking of starting
a private business,

329
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,840
but we haven't decided what yet.

330
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,040
Now that the internal hotel drama is over,

331
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,920
only Chen's left.

332
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,840
So I want you back to help out.

Mom.

335
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,440
Where's Rawee and Rak? Still not here?

336
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,120
Ask your sister-in-law.
Rawee went to pick up Rak.

337
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,880
Rawee left before dawn.
They should be almost here.

338
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,960
Madam. Chen is here.

339
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,720
Who invited him?

340
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,840
Wait, Mom.

341
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,160
He came with Mr. Bancha.

342
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,480
Is that the man
who gave you the diamond set?

343
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,640
Yes, Mom. That's him.

344
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,520
- What's going on?
- Looks like a car accident.

345
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,480
Seriously?

347
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,360
You didn't use your signal.
How was I supposed to know?

348
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,760
That's not it. That's not how it happened.

349
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,680
You were supposed to wait.
I had the right of way.

350
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,600
We'll have to leave the car and walk,
or we'll miss the ceremony.

351
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,800
Yeah, let's go.

352
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,400
Take care of my daughter, all right?

353
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,880
Be happy, sweetie. I love you.

354
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,920
Chome!

355
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,360
Wait!

356
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,040
Bro.

357
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,600
Korn!

358
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,360
- Korn.
- My dear.

359
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,320

You looked down on me.

361
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,920
Today, I'm taking you and your son down.

362
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,000
Ranee!

363
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,120
Ranee!

364
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,080
Ranee!

365
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,400
- Drop the gun.
- Stop!

366
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,320
If anyone comes near me,
I'll kill every last one of you!

367
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,360
- Drop your gun.
- Stop!

368
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,280
Let go!

369
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,760
Let go!

370
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,800
Let go!

371
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,520
Korn!

372
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,480
Korn!

373
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,040
Korn.

374
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,680
Let go!

375
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,800
- Korn!
- Let go!

376
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,880
Korn!

377
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,520
Let go of me!

378
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,560
Do you even realize what you've done?!

379
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,920
Of course I do.

380
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,080
Your mother humiliated me.

381
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,080
She hated me as if I was some filthy worm.

382
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,840
Your brother used me

383
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,680
and threw me away!

384
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,320
They both deserved to die!

385
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,800
And you think you're innocent?

386
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,240
You lied to everyone
and now you're demanding sincerity?

387
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,080
Stop!

388
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,520
You deserve to rot in jail!

389
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,800
At least

390
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,560
I get to die after your mom and brother.

391
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,920
- Come to the police station.
- No!

392
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,680
- Go!
- I want them dead!

393
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,440
- I hate them!
- Korn!

394
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,040
Korn.

395
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,080
Korn!

396
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,720
Korn, don't sleep.

397
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,400
- Korn, don't sleep.
- Korn!

398
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,640
Korn, talk to me.

399
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,280
Korn, please.

400
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,760
- Korn.
- Has anyone called a doctor?

401
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,400
The ambulance is on the way.

402
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,560
Korn.

403
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,840
Please clear the area.

404
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,080
- Please.
- Please.

405
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,000
Please don't crowd.

406
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,760
Korn…

407
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,680
- Korn…
- Korn.

408
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,960
- Talk to me, Korn. Please…
- Korn.

409
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,680
Ranee…

410
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,400
Ranee, you'll be okay.

411
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,600
Just hang on.

412
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,120
The doctor's coming.

413
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,000
- Ranee…
- Korn, you can't sleep.

414
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,040
Korn…

415
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,040
Korn!

416
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,520
Madam!

417
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,720
- Madam!
- Mom!

418
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,600
- Mom!
- Madam!

419
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,560
- Madam!
- Korn, don't sleep.

420
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Korn, don't sleep.

421
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,200
You're going to survive, okay?

422
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,880
Don't leave me.

423
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,480
You can't leave me alone.

424
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,000
Ranee?

425
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,280
Ranee…

426
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,120
Ranee?

427
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,160
Ranee?

428
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,600
Ranee!

429
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,840
Ranee!

430
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,720
Ngor.

431
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,040
Yes, ma'am?

432
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,680
Why am I here?

433
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,520
You fainted.

434
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,960
The doctor gave you something
and put you on IV.

435
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,320
What about Korn and Ranee? Are they safe?

436
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,240
They're still in surgery.

437
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,560
Rawee.

438
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,520
Are they out yet?

439
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,760
Not yet.

440
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

441
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,240
What about your brother?

442
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,800
Still in there.

443
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,360
Doctor, how are they?

444
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,120
I'm very sorry.

445
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,800
We couldn't save both patients.

446
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,320
Cha-aim…

447
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,840
How are Korn and Ranee?

448
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,440
Tell me. How are Korn and Ranee?

449
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,000
Dear.

450
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,280
The surgery's done.

451
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,240
Did they both make it?

452
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,480
No.

453
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,360
Only one survived.

454
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,720
Who?

455
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,200
Korn!

456
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,520
Korn!

457
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,240
No!

458
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,600
Young Master.

459
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,160
Madam.

460
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,960
No!

461
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,440
Madam.

462
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,480
Madam.

463
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,520
Korn…

464
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,240
Korn…

465
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,200
I'm leaving.

466
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,080
Where will you go?
You're not staying with me?

467
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,440
Who else do I have now?

468
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,360
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

469
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,000
So you're planning to cheat me?

470
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,040
Rak?

471
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,520
RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

472
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,840
What business do you have, Madam?

473
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,320
The hotel is beautiful,

474
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,840
clean, and nice.

475
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,600
