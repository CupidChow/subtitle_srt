1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Mom's trying to take everything
back from Chen, isn't she?

2
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,040
Who manages the rice mill's accounts now?

3
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,000
I do.

4
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,160
Starting today,

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,120
it will be managed
by the first daughter-in-law.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
Thank you, Mom.

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>who can mend this family.</i>

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
I'm counting on you, Rawee.

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,720
If I'm going to go against Chen and Hong,
you won't be mad, right?

10
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,880
He never thinks of me as a brother,
so why should I see him as one?

11
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,240
This is Chomechawee, my wife.

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,560
Do you think there's a way
to get Mom to accept her?

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
Chome.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
I asked what you do.

15
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm a singer.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,680
A singer? One of those bar girls?

17
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,480
Sounds like there might be a chance,
from what I’ve heard.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,480
That's not all.

19
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,960
Chome is a singer at a bar.

20
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Singing is an honest profession.

21
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,720
Not everyone can sing well enough
to become a star at a bar.

22
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,640
It takes both talent and skill.

23
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,240
Mom won't think the same way.

24
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
She looks down on people
who work in entertainment.

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,240
There's no way she'll ever accept her
as a daughter-in-law.

26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
Where do you sing regularly?

27
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,040
Who are your parents, and what do they do?

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,760
Did you graduate from school?
Besides singing,

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
do you have
any other skills to make a living?

30
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,600
Mom.

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,920
Where's Chome, Mom?

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,800
I sent her away.

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,440
Why did you do that?

34
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
I don't like her.

35
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,960
I won't let you be with her.

36
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,480
She's completely unsuitable for you.

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm going to marry her.

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,360
I won't allow it.

39
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,760
I'm going to marry Chome.

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,560
This is my life.
I have the right to choose my own wife.

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,000
Stop dictating. Stop putting
your own will above everyone else's.

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,680
So defiant.

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
If you insist on marrying her,
then go live somewhere else.

44
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
Come on, Mei.

45
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,760
Don't kick your son out of the house.
Right or wrong,

46
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,640
we can still work it out.

47
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,600
Just look at him.

48
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,760
He's talking back to me like this.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,040
No one in this house
talks to me like that.

50
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,320
Even when Rawee
was blindly infatuated with that girl,

51
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,000
he never dared speak to me like this.

52
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Fine.

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,800
If you insist on marrying that performer,

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,320
then get out of my house!

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,400
Fine, I will!

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,360
I'll stay in this house
only if Chome stays with me!

57
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
-Korn!
-Korn.

58
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,480
Come back!

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,280
-Dad!
-Dad!

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
You go after Korn. I'll take care of Dad.

61
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm feeling dizzy.

62
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,960
I'm all right.

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
Dad, let's get you to your room to rest.

64
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,960
Korn.

65
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,200
Korn. Korn.

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
Talk to me first.

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,720
There's nothing left to say.

68
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
Today, tomorrow, whenever,

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
it all ends the same.

70
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,320
No one can change Mom's mind.

71
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,840
Korn,

72
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
if you'd just cooled down a little,
things wouldn't have blown up.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,600
That doesn't mean Mom will accept Chome.

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm not as lucky as you.

75
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,600
You loved someone, and she loved you back.

76
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,120
First love, true love,

77
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
marriage, happy ending.

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Still, I don't agree with you

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,680
throwing away your home and family
for a girl you've just started seeing.

80
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,320
Go tell Mom that.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,760
She already has
three wealthy daughters-in-law.

82
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
One poor daughter-in-law

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,520
working in bars

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
won't kill her!

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,480
Korn, marriage isn't a light decision.

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,200
I think you should date her a bit longer

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,040
before deciding.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,080
When you first met Ranee,

89
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
did you fall in love with her

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,640
and want to marry her?

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
Me too.

92
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,520
Then let me ask you this.

93
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,960
Do you truly love Chome,

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
or are you just lonely
and looking for someone?

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,560
Move aside. I have to go find her.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Korn. Korn!

97
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,280
Rawee.

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,000
Chome. Chome.

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry

100
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,880
I couldn't protect you.

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,200
I prepared myself.

102
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,240
If Mom won't let us stay here,

103
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,160
then we won't.

104
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,360
We can move into a rental house.

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
Dad would never let me suffer anyway.

106
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,720
I'm not afraid of hardship.

107
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,400
I've been through it my whole life.
I'm used to it.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm just scared…

109
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,640
scared I might lose you.

110
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
You don't have to be scared.

111
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,920
I will never leave you.

112
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Let me take it, Dad.

113
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
Thanks.

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,800
You all should go eat.

115
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm fine now.

116
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Are you sure it's just a fever
and a headache, Dad?

117
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
Why would I lie to you?

118
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,640
I’ve been working nonstop,
out in the sun and rain.

119
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm old now,
not as strong as the younger ones.

120
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
If that's the case,
you shouldn't work so hard.

121
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,120
You've got plenty of children.

122
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,000
You've got four sons
and three daughters-in-law.

123
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,520
You just need to sit back
and give the orders.

124
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
But still, you should go
to the hospital for a full check-up

125
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,760
just in case, so we can treat it early.

126
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,640
Hey, that sounds like you're cursing him.

127
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,000
Why would you call that a curse?

128
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,600
Dad said it's just a fever.

129
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,080
Who would know better than a doctor?

130
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,440
All right, all right. No need to argue.

131
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,240
If I'm not better in a day or two,

132
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,080
I'll go see a doctor for sure.

133
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,320
Then you should rest a lot, Dad.

134
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,720
How can he rest with all of you
crowding the room like this?

135
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,600
Have you finished buttering him up yet?
Then leave.

136
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
Your father's not dying today or tomorrow.

137
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,240
If anyone’s cursing him,

138
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,800
it’s probably your mom.

139
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
Let's go, Hong.

140
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
Rest well, Dad.

141
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,800
Dear,

142
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,040
if you're not better tomorrow,
please go see a doctor.

143
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,640
I've heard you coughing

144
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
several nights already.

145
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,320
About Korn…

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Just rest first.

147
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,640
Don't worry about that now.

148
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,760
Let's talk when you feel better.

149
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
I had them make you fish porridge.

150
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Sleep for a bit and eat when you wake up.

151
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
I'll come and eat with you.

152
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,720
Just sleep now.

153
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
I'll take those.

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
Where's Korn?

155
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,920
He's gone.

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,280
You know where he's staying, right?

157
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,960
Then look after him.

158
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
I'll try talking to Mom.

159
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,920
Okay.

160
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,280
Your welcome party
turned out kind of sour.

161
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,240
It's all right.

162
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,040
We can't enjoy ourselves
while Korn is in pain.

163
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,600
You guys go get some rest.
I'm going to take a short walk.

164
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
See you then.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,160
So beautiful.

166
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
Who's there?

167
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,640
Who's hiding behind the bushes?

168
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,560
Come on. She doesn't recognize me.

169
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,240
Mr. Rak?

170
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,200
Chan. Chan, where are you?

171
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm here, Tub.

172
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Look, Tub.

173
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,240
The moon feels so close to us tonight!

174
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,760
You're right.

175
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,760
Where have you been?
I've been waiting forever.

176
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
Is that a new nightgown?

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,120
Can’t let my husband get bored, can I?

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,840
The house is full of daughters-in-law now.

179
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,720
Being the first daughter-in-law
might not be enough.

180
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,280
I have to give your parents their
first grandson before any of them do.

181
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,040
I think I'll shower first.

182
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,600
I didn’t expect Mom to say
something that harsh to you.

183
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
I understand.

184
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,960
With a wealthy family like yours,

185
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,600
of course your mom's afraid
a woman might try to trap her son.

186
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,640
Especially a woman like me,
who has nothing.

187
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,240
If she absolutely won't accept you,

188
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,319
I'll ask Dad to buy us a house.

189
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,960
As for work,

190
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,400
I can still help him out.

191
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,280
Money won't be an issue.

192
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,480
But will you be okay

193
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,440
not living in comfort?

194
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,920
I already told you.

195
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,320
I've lived through worse.

196
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,680
But if we give Mom her first grandson
before anyone else does,

197
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,560
maybe things will turn around.

198
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,600
Hey, Korn.

199
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
Come on.

200
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,720
Come here.

201
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,120
Korn.

202
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't think
this is going to be resolved quickly.

203
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,360
Korn probably won't
come back home that easily.

204
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,240
And Mom's not going to accept Chome.

205
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
I feel sorry for your dad.

206
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,200
He's sick, and now
he's got this to deal with too.

207
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
It's not just about Korn.

208
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Didn't you notice?
Rak and Chen aren't getting along.

209
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,320
And the sisters-in-law are at odds.

210
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,840
That's not even all.

211
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,760
Your mom doesn't like me either.

212
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,160
That problem's easy for me to solve.

213
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
Hey! What are you doing?

214
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,680
All right.

215
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Come on, let's go to sleep.
Don't you have work tomorrow?

216
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,640
There's still plenty of time.
I don't want Korn to beat me.

217
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,160
Hey.

218
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Good thing Korn's wife
didn't get into the house.

219
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
There are already
too many daughters-in-law!

220
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,240
By now they're probably all racing to have
the first grandson for Dad's favor.

221
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
It's all because of that Madam Mei.

222
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
That's why we couldn't have
a child to compete with them.

223
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,640
Why bring that up again?

224
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
I'm sorry.

225
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,960
Did you make dinner plans
with your parents?

226
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,240
Yes, I did.

227
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,080
Do you want me to come along?

228
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
No need. I can handle it.

229
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,400
Do we have enough capital

230
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,760
for the investment?

231
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,080
Don't worry.
I've already talked to our partners.

232
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,080
We’re just missing a little
to make up our portion.

233
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,040
Isn't it too risky? It's all we've got.

234
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,920
We have to take the risk.

235
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,720
Otherwise, we'll never beat
Madam Mei's children.

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
You're right.

237
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,560
Rawee's going to work with you tomorrow,

238
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,920
so be careful.

239
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,800
He seems sharper than the rest.

240
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,600
He might ruin our plans.

241
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,640
I know how to handle him.
You don't have to worry.

242
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,480
Are you alright?

243
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,440
I cough less sitting up.

244
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,160
I might have to sleep like this.

245
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,720
It must be the phlegm.

246
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,560
Tomorrow,

247
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,080
you should see a doctor. I'll go with you.

248
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,920
But don't you have a land visit scheduled

249
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
in Kanchanaburi tomorrow?

250
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,600
It's fine. I'll send Rak instead.

251
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
I ran into Mr. Rak earlier.

252
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,480
Who did you see?

253
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,120
Mr. Rak.

254
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,360
So you remember him now?

255
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,760
Just his name. Mr. Rak. Young Master.

256
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,080
Did he see you?

257
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,560
Of course. He was hiding, watching me.

258
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,880
At first, I was scared.
I thought it was a thief.

259
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,320
But when I turned and saw him,
he hid behind the bushes.

260
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And then?

261
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,880
So I followed him.

262
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Up close, he's really handsome,
just like you, Tub.

263
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Did he know you remembered his name?

264
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,920
Yes. I called him Mr. Rak.

265
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
He looked so shocked that I remembered.

266
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,560
Did he say anything to you?

267
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,280
You showed up just then, so I ran to you.

268
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,480
Why is it taking so long?

269
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
Madam,

270
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,880
Prajak will have to drive
Mr. Rak to Kanchanaburi, won't he?

271
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,400
Yes.

272
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,080
Here comes the nurse.

273
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,400
The doctor would like to speak
with you and the master together.

274
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,360
Is it something serious?

275
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
It's best you hear it directly
from the doctor.

276
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,480
Ngor, go back and tell Rak
he'll have to drive himself,

277
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,760
just in case we'll still need Prajak.

278
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,920
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,200
How am I supposed to get there?

280
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,320
I've never even been to Kanchanaburi.

281
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,880
Madam said to call ahead
and ask for directions.

282
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,920
Are you going to Kanchanaburi?

283
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,400
I know the roads well.
I run errands for Madam all the time.

284
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,560
But aren't you supposed
to drive your boss today?

285
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,120
I can drive myself.

286
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm just going shopping nearby.

287
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,160
Can you drive Rak instead?

288
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
Sure.

289
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,400
Thanks.

290
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
Let's go.

291
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,720
Tub.

292
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,600
Don't tell Auntie about this.

293
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,320
Got it.

294
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,840
Can we really trust him?

295
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,560
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

296
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,200
You'll work in this room for now.

297
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,720
You can move to mine next month.

298
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,560
Yes.

299
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,240
I've got meetings all day today.

300
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
Should I attend too?

301
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,000
No need.

302
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
It's your first day.

303
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,160
Just get familiar
with the hotel's systems.

304
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,960
If you need any information

305
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,800
or want to speak
with any department heads,

306
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
you can ask her.

307
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,080
I've got to head to the meeting.

308
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Understood.

309
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm Noon, by the way.

310
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,760
I see.

311
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,560
Would you like coffee or a snack?

312
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,680
Not yet, thanks.

313
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,760
There are more documents in the car.

314
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
I'll ask the maid to bring the rest.

315
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,800
Go through these thoroughly.

316
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
And make sure Master
and Madam don't find out.

317
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,080
I'll pay you extra for this.

319
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Thank you.

320
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,160
I need a nap. If I have
to get up early like this every day,

321
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,080
I'll die for sure.

322
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,800
I thought you'd forgotten it.

323
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,720
Of course not.

324
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,040
-Please, have a seat.
-Thanks.

325
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,600
Would you like a hot coffee?

326
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,400
I already had one, thank you.

327
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Are you sure your singing teacher is nice?

328
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,120
She's very nice

329
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,280
and well-connected too.

330
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,400
You'll definitely get a singing job.

331
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,040
I just want to help out financially
and ease Korn’s burden.

332
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,000
It's because of me

333
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,760
that he got kicked out.

334
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,680
Things will get better.

335
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,560
Should we go? I've made
an appointment with the teacher.

336
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,360
Yes.

337
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
Don't turn around.

338
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,360
What is it?

339
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,960
My brother.

340
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,720
He's gone now.

341
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,000
Wait, he doesn't know you're here?

342
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,040
No.

343
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,040
He must have gone to the bar to ask me
for money, and the staff must’ve told him.

344
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,520
Let's go now, okay?

345
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,040
Sure.

346
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,080
Let's go.

347
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,200
Easy, slow down.

348
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,760
Sit slowly.

349
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,360
No need to baby me like this.

350
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,160
I'm not that sick.

351
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,600
An enlarged heart isn't nothing.

352
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
Can you still drink tea?

353
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,240
If you forbid me from drinking hot tea,

354
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,760
you may as well kill me.

355
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,880
Pour it.

356
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,320
Yes, sir.

357
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,920
Ngor, from now on,

358
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,240
make the tea very light for him.

359
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,040
-Yes, ma'am.
-From now on, you need to be

360
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,160
very careful about his diet.

361
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,120
Cut back on fried, oily, and salty foods.

362
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,680
Avoid them completely, if possible.

363
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,200
Dear, you can only eat
steamed or boiled fish, okay?

364
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,920
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,960
But he's safe now, isn't he?

366
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,200
Nothing serious anymore?

367
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,240
If you're that curious,
just come out and listen.

368
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,400
No need to sneak around!

369
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,720
This is between us.

370
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Don't run off telling your boss.

371
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,760
I wouldn't dare.

372
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
You'd better not.

373
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,440
Now go.

374
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,360
Dear, rest a bit.

375
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,560
Then come down and have
your lunch and medicine.

376
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,800
Heart disease.

377
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,480
Come in.

378
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,840
Do you know why
we're now getting our towels

379
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
from Prasitphat
instead of our usual supplier?

380
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,680
No, sir.

381
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,200
And what does this company do?
Why do they distribute many things?

382
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,360
They sell cookware, toilets,

383
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,640
and now even office chairs.

384
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
So now they’re handling all our orders?

385
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,200
Maybe they're cheaper?

386
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,520
Would you like me
to call the department head?

387
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,360
No need. I've got time today.

388
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,600
I'll head to the company myself.

389
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,680
Manager,

390
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,000
we've got a problem.

391
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,960
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

392
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,400
Pick up now.

393
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,760
It's me, Chen.

394
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,680
There's a hotshot newcomer
heading to the company.

395
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Don't let him get there.

396
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,280
Don't go too hard on him.

397
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,720
Just enough
that he'll be hospitalized for a week.

398
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,360
That'll give me time to handle things.

399
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,239
Nosy brat.

400
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,639
Would you like to come in first?

401
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,520
It's all right. I should head back.

402
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,280
As you wish.

403
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,159
All right.

404
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,880
I hope you get a job soon.

405
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,200
Thank you.

406
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
See you later.

407
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,200
ROAD CONSTRUCTION AHEAD

408
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm looking for Prasitphat Company.

409
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,120
The road's under construction, sir.

410
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,560
You’ll have to take the next alley.

411
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,640
Do you want my brother to guide you there?

412
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,680
Sure.

413
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Follow me, sir.

414
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,480
Thank you.

415
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,600
How was it?

416
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,640
Ranee took me to meet her singing teacher.

417
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,400
To be honest,
I'd rather you didn't take a singing job.

418
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
I can take care of you.

419
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,280
But since it's something you love,

420
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,880
I don't want to stand in your way.

421
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,920
Well.

422
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,760
Thank you.

423
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,800
Do you know

424
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,280
who I saw at the market today?

425
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,280
Mom?

426
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,760
No.

427
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,880
My brother. He followed me here.

428
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,200
You have a brother?

429
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,240
She sure does!

430
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,360
Chat?

431
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,600
Yeah, it's me.

432
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,600
You ran off with this pale-faced guy

433
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,600
because you wanted to stop
sending me money, right?

434
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,560
Right?!

435
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,840
Please leave my house.

436
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,840
You pale-faced bastard!
You seduced my sister?

437
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,840
-Korn!
-Come here!

438
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,760
-Stop!
-Come here!

439
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,760
Please, don't hurt him! I beg you!

440
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,720
You stupid girl!
He's just freeloading off you,

441
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,280
and you don't even see it!

442
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,520
You're coming back to Bangkok with me!

443
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,240
No! I'm not going!
I'll keep sending you money.

444
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,640
I promise. Please.

445
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,040
I'll keep sending you money.

446
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,920
Are you going to marry him?

447
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,520
Will I get the dowry?

448
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,360
How much do you want? Name your price.

449
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,440
You think you can just buy me off?

450
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,720
Die now!

451
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,120
Chat! Don't hurt him!

452
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,960
-Let go of me!
-Chat!

453
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,240
Please don't hurt him. I beg you.

454
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Stupid girl! If you're not marrying him,

455
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
you're coming back to Bangkok with me!

456
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,240
Understand?

457
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,600
-Come!
-No!

458
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,240
-Come now.
-Chat.

459
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,960
-Chome, run!
-Chome!

460
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,400
-Go!
-Chome!

461
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,280
Damn it!

462
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,640
Chome!

463
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,600
Mr. Rak. Mr. Rak.

464
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,480
Are we there?

465
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,480
Not yet. I think I'm lost.

466
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,160
What? You said you'd been
there many times.

467
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,760
We're already late.

468
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,840
I'll ask someone nearby.

469
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,320
Fine. Make it quick.

470
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,920
I'm turning off the engine.
We're low on gas.

471
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,080
All right.

472
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,360
This is a dead end.

473
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,480
Hey!

474
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,240
What are you doing?

475
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,120
I saw a huge gold necklace.
Just one piece is worth your trouble.

476
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,440
Thanks a lot, man.
You're really handing me a windfall.

477
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,280
Hurry and take care of it.

478
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,200
Yeah.

479
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
You think you're really handsome?

480
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,800
Dear,

481
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,920
try some tea with peanuts
and sweet potatoes.

482
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,040
They may not go perfectly together,

483
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,840
but they're better than sweets.

484
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,240
Hey! You can't go in!

485
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,440
Please, let me in. Please!

486
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,160
I told you, you can't go in!

487
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Get out now!

488
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,600
Master, Madam,

489
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,320
please help us.

490
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,400
-Chome?
-Get out! Now! Get up!

491
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Ngor, let's hear her out.

492
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,160
What happened?

493
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,440
And what happened to your face?

494
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,120
My brother came looking for me.

495
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,160
He hurt Mr. Korn.
He's unconscious at the house.

496
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,360
And you just left him like that?

497
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,320
I ran away from my brother.

498
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,280
Where's your house?

499
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,160
I know the way. I'll take you.

500
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
You're a girl. How can you go there?

501
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,240
What if he's still there?

502
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,320
So educated, yet no common sense.

503
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,800
Ngor, call Miss Napa
at the hospital for me.

504
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,320
Yes, sir.

505
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,880
Tell her Korn's address.

506
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,920
Yes.

507
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,560
I'm going to the police.

508
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,720
Madam, I beg you.

509
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Please don't report my brother!

510
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,840
Let go of me!

511
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,760
My brother hangs out with gangsters.

512
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,400
If he gets arrested,
they'll come for revenge.

513
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Everyone will be in more danger.

514
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,040
Korn really brought trouble
into this house.

515
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,800
Get out of my sight right now.

516
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,840
Get out! Leave!

517
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,320
Mr. Rak?

518
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,440
Mr. Rak.

519
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,640
Mr. Rak.

520
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,000
Rak!

521
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,080
Hey.

522
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,800
Hey.

523
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,640
You don't need to come.

524
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,320
His condition isn’t serious.

525
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,520
He's just waiting for checkups.

526
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,680
I just want to see his face
and feel reassured.

527
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,520
I'll go.

528
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,040
There are so many patients
at the hospital.

529
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,080
You might catch something worse.

530
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,320
All right.

531
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,200
You can ride in my car.

532
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,320
Why are you going?
It's none of your business.

533
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,440
So I'm not part of this household?

534
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,160
Am I not family to Korn?

535
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,720
For heaven's sake!

536
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,280
You talk like a smart-mouth. Annoying.

537
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,120
Just stay and keep him company.

538
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,640
-Dear.
-Hello?

539
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,680
I'll go and come back quickly, okay?

540
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,240
Take Ngor with you.

541
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,480
Yes, I'm Mr. Rawee's wife.

542
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,080
From the hospital?

543
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,320
What happened to Rawee?

544
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,440
What's going on now?

545
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,000
I'll talk to them.

546
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,400
I'm Rawee's mother. What happened?

547
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,480
Does it hurt a lot?

548
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Seeing your face
makes all the pain disappear.

549
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,800
You still can make jokes.

550
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,440
I'm just glad it's nothing serious.

551
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,960
How's Korn?

552
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,000
Just a few bruises.

553
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,480
He's in a room nearby.

554
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
You brothers sure love each other.

555
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,920
When one's hurt, the others' hurt too.

556
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,560
Who hurt Korn?

557
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,200
Chomechawee's brother.

558
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,280
He thought Korn seduced his sister.

559
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,520
But you were supposed to be at the hotel.

560
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,360
Why did you go out for lunch
and end up getting robbed?

561
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,360
I wasn't out for lunch.

562
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,760
Then why did you go out?

563
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,560
Don't tell anyone yet.

564
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,560
I suspected corruption in the hotel.

565
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,680
I went out to investigate.

566
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,880
But someone inside must've caught on.

567
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,000
So it might not have been
a random robbery.

568
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,360
It could've been an ambush

569
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,840
to keep you quiet.

570
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,320
I'm fine now.

571
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,680
Why do I have to stay
in the hospital, Mom?

572
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,120
You want to die out there or what?

573
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,600
Her thug brother is still out there.

574
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,840
You're safer here.

575
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,760
But I can't stay
in the hospital forever, Mom.

576
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,080
I'm trying to figure out a solution.

577
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,360
Until then, you stay put.

578
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,440
If I could just stay home,
this would all be over.

579
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,080
You got hurt because you didn't know

580
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,520
how to pick a girl.

581
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,760
Did you report him to the police?

582
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,640
-He's still Chome's brother.
-Hey!

583
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,200
He hurt you this badly,
and you still care about their family?

584
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,320
The only reason I didn't report him is
because you're not completely blameless.

585
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,120
What if her brother believes

586
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,240
you really seduced his sister? Then what?

587
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,680
He seems greedy.

588
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,040
If we arrange a meeting

589
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,440
and offer some compensation…

590
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,000
Sure, and then kick his sister out too.

591
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,760
Mom!

592
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,960
What are you hanging around for?

593
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,720
I have nowhere to go.

594
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,600
Then go home.

595
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,560
Your brother won't kill his sister.

596
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,080
I'm scarier than him.

597
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,360
Go. I don't want to see your face again.

598
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,000
Leave!

599
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,360
You're not going anywhere.

600
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,640
You're staying with me.

601
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,880
Get inside.

602
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,320
MANAGER'S OFFICE

603
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,400
We don't even know how serious
the heart condition is now.

604
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,960
If something happens to Dad,
you're going to be in real trouble.

605
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,600
Just give me six more months.

606
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,720
If there's anything I can help with,
just let me know, okay?

607
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,840
Yeah? What's up?

608
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,560
He didn't see your face, right?

609
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,400
Good. Be careful
when you drop the stuff off.

610
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Thanks.

611
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,960
What happened?

612
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,920
Rawee got suspicious.

613
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,600
He was going to visit
Master Prasit's company.

614
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,960
What?

615
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,480
Did he get any evidence?

616
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,000
I had someone intercept him in time.

617
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,880
But won't he figure out it was you?

618
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,360
He's sharp.

619
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,800
He'll probably piece it together.

620
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,680
But if he's smart enough,

621
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,320
he should know to stay out of it

622
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,120
if he still wants to live happily
with his beloved wife…

623
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,840
Rawee's filed a police report.

624
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,960
But I doubt they'll catch anyone.

625
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,400
Both my boys got hurt…

626
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,200
At least no one was seriously injured.

627
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,960
I really wanted

628
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,880
to report
that thug brother of that singer.

629
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,320
But I'm afraid it'll escalate.

630
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,840
It's best to avoid

631
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,640
gangsters if we can.

632
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,200
Maybe he was just overprotective
of his sister.

633
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,440
He's greedy, that's what.

634
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,880
His sister ran off with a guy
and cost him income.

635
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,880
Should we just

636
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,760
let them date for now?

637
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,560
You'd really accept
a daughter-in-law like her?

638
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,920
She’s not going to help Korn stand
on equal footing with his brothers.

639
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,360
Nothing matters

640
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,600
more than love.

641
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,440
That girl seems gentle.

642
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,160
She won't dare go against you.

643
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,600
Leaving them alone like that…

644
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,400
If her brother
comes back to hurt him again,

645
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,280
Ronnakorn might not be so lucky next time.

646
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,640
No, Mr. Rak! What happened to you?!

647
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,840
What now?

648
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,600
Rak! Oh my God!

649
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,800
What happened to you?

650
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,760
What happened?

651
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,040
I got robbed, Mom.

652
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,000
What?

653
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,040
Your body's fine.

654
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,160
It's like they just wanted
to disfigure you.

655
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,280
Let me see. Will these leave scars?

656
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,760
It will ruin your handsome face.

657
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,120
I'm sorry, Madam.

658
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,560
I was driving Mr. Rak.

659
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,720
It's all right.

660
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,440
I asked him to help me.

661
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,400
I got lost,

662
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,040
so I parked
and went to ask for directions.

663
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,600
I didn't expect
a robbery in broad daylight.

664
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,800
You're a driver,

665
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,200
and you got lost?

666
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,600
Why did you volunteer to help?

667
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,200
The gold necklace
and the watch are all gone.

668
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,360
I warned you, didn't I?

669
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,240
Don't wear flashy jewelry
in unfamiliar places.

670
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,960
It attracts trouble.

671
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,200
It's just stuff.

672
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,720
What matters is that Rak is safe.

673
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,040
What bad luck we’ve had today.

674
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,240
All three of my sons got hurt
on the same day.

675
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,600
Oh, my son. Come on, get some rest.

676
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,360
-Let's get you cleaned up. Be careful.
-Walk carefully.

677
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,240
You're okay, right?

678
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,280
Yes, sir.

679
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Should I buy something for your brothers?

680
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,360
So Madam can toss it in the trash?

681
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,400
That family doesn't accept
kindness from us.

682
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,080
Just be good to my dad. That's enough.

683
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,440
I'll remember that.

684
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,000
Manager, Madam Mei is on the line.

685
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,600
Send two hotel guards
to keep watch at my house.

686
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,200
I'll pay the extra fees.

687
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,160
What for?

688
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,640
I told you to do it. No questions.

689
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,080
When should I send them?

690
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,640
Tonight.

691
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,280
I'll take care of it.

692
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,720
What was the call about?

693
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,040
She told me to send guards to her house.

694
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,560
I think we should go home
for dinner tonight.

695
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,400
Why are you in such a rush? Stay and talk.

696
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,200
Why did you embezzle from your own hotel?

697
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,040
You're home so late.

698
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,000
<i>I found a way</i>
<i>to get back at that Duangporn.</i>

699
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,640
<i>She looked down on me.</i>

700
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,480
Mei hurt us first.

701
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,920
She doesn't deserve happiness.

702
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,120
<i>Old flames are about to reignite.</i>

703
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,400
Who are you talking about?

704
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,920
Your husband.

705
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,720
Mr. Rak and I used to be in love, right?

706
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,640
