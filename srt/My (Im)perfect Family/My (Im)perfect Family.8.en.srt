1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,240
I have three sons. Let's see

2
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,920
if any of them can do better than someone
without an education like you.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,520
<i>He and I are both Dad's sons. So why does</i>
<i>he always get more than me?</i>

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>Can you promise me,</i>
<i>no matter what happens,</i>

5
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,520
you'll marry only me?

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,280
Get out!

7
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,600
Get out!

8
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
-Have you heard about it?
-What is it?

9
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,280
If you want my help,
we need to make a deal.

10
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,640
What do you want? Say it.

11
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
MANAGER ROOM

12
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,720
Thank you very much

13
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,120
for helping resolve
the situation at the hotel.

14
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,240
Don't worry, Dad. I'm not here
to steal my brother's position.

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,480
I'll just step in
and stabilize everything.

16
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,000
After that, it's up to you.

17
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,480
When you move in,

18
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
just turn a deaf ear.

19
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't mind anything Mei says.

20
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,520
I accepted that the moment
I agreed to help you.

21
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
I knew Madam

22
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,440
would think I orchestrated all of this.

23
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
But I don't care.

24
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,280
I just want to bring Hong
to live under the same roof as you.

25
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,600
I've been alone for so long.

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm really lonely, Dad.

27
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,320
I want a family.

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,880
Even if we argue every day,

29
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,160
it's still better

30
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,880
than hearing nothing but my own breathing.

31
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
Slow down or you'll choke.

32
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes, Mom.

33
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,960
Madam! She's here!

34
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,560
Bring my things in.

35
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,360
Just stack them here first.

36
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
What are you doing?

37
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm moving in.
So of course, I need to bring my things.

38
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,520
Today?

39
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,320
Yes. You gave your word, didn't you?

40
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,560
Or are you going back on it?

41
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,600
You two can leave now.

42
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,120
So, where's our room?

43
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,800
-Ngor.
-Yes, ma'am.

44
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,280
Take her to see the room. Since this is
all so sudden, she can clean it herself.

45
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,960
Yes, ma'am. Follow me.

46
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,560
You two, take my things up.

47
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,120
My brothers-in-law are all here.

48
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,920
What are you having? I've been
moving stuff all day. I'm starving.

49
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,520
Mind if I join?

50
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,920
Hey! Let's toast!

51
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,720
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

52
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,800
-It's so refreshing.
-Yes.

53
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,520
-It's great.
-It is.

54
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,160
Look who's here! Our new hotel manager!

55
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,280
Hey.

56
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
All right. Thanks, everyone.

57
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
Eat and drink all you want tonight.
It's on me.

58
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,880
Wow.

59
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,840
-Please have a seat.
-Get him a glass now.

60
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
Have a seat, Manager.

61
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

62
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah!

63
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,800
We're officially husband and wife now.
How about a honeymoon tonight?

64
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,080
Ouch!

65
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,240
So you rushed the Christian wedding
because you had wicked intentions, right?

66
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,400
I was just asking!

67
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,400
We can't honeymoon just yet.

68
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,080
I won't feel right

69
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,080
until both our families accept us.

70
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,280
Mom definitely won't acknowledge
the ceremony.

71
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,600
She'll say it's a different religion.

72
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,520
If they really refuse to let us marry,

73
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,160
will you still do what we agreed on?

74
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,520
You're not afraid of the hardship?

75
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,520
If I have you, I'm not afraid of anything.

76
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,920
-What was that?
-Sounds like a chair fell.

77
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,280
Could it be a burglar?

78
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Wait for me.

79
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
I thought it was a burglar.

80
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,440
Turns out it's just some street drunk.

81
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,280
Who are you calling that?

82
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Who else? Just look at yourself.

83
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
You're a mess.

84
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,000
The new manager of Charoenrung Hotel?

85
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,520
What a disgrace.

86
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,200
Are you talking about me or your son?

87
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,120
Chen! If you're drunk,
go back to your room and sleep it off.

88
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Where? Where's my room?

89
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,920
I don't see any room.

90
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,040
Go throw up outside! Filthy!

91
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
Dear.

92
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,760
Why did you get this drunk?

93
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Good timing. Take him back to your room.

94
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
Let's go. I'll take you to bed.

95
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,320
I just had a little to drink.
I'm not drunk.

96
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,440
If you want to stay in this house,
you'll follow the rules.

97
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,040
But if you're going to get drunk
and cause a scene,

98
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
go stay somewhere else.

99
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,480
And if you can't quit drinking,

100
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,120
then take your wife and leave.

101
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,200
He's not usually like this, ma'am.

102
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,280
Today was just a special occasion.

103
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,400
I don't care.

104
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,600
If you want to stay here,
you follow my rules.

105
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,160
And don't think you can turn
people against me again.

106
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,080
All the staff here,
I hand-picked every one of them.

107
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,800
I won't make the same mistake
I did with the hotel staff.

108
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,480
Hong, take Chen to bed.

109
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Yes, Dad.

110
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,200
Let's go.

111
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,600
Enjoy yourselves while you can.
Once Rawee graduates and returns,

112
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,280
I'll appoint him
as the new hotel manager immediately.

113
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,720
You're the one who told your father
you didn't want the position.

114
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Then give it up

115
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,200
because I'm certain Rawee

116
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,840
will manage the hotel
far better than you ever could.

117
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,960
I'll go get you some tea.

118
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,200
No need. I'm not drunk.

119
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,960
I just wanted to provoke Madam.

120
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,040
I thought so.
You've never gotten that drunk before.

121
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,480
I didn't want to act timid
in front of her from day one.

122
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,800
Being drunk makes it easier. No matter
how harshly I speak, Dad will forgive me.

123
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,840
That woman really hates you.

124
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,480
Two of her sons failed,

125
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
yet she still insists
on pushing the third for the position.

126
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Let's hope he's like his brothers,

127
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,520
book-smart but useless at real work.

128
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,640
I hope so too.

129
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,720
Just watch.

130
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm going to rise above all her children.

131
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,760
And you, build your reputation
as the first daughter-in-law.

132
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,640
Dominate all the others
and bring them under your command.

133
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,200
We will seize
all the power in this family…

134
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,160
and make Madam Mei choke
on her own rage until it kills her.

135
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,400
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

136
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,400
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Hello, Mr. Chen.

137
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,560
Welcome back to Charoenrung Hotel.

138
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,520
I've reserved the entire floor for you.

139
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,480
Thank you. You know exactly what I want.

140
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,400
My pleasure, sir.

141
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,440
Sir, may we take a few photos?

142
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,640
<i>Rawee, come home soon.</i>

143
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,640
<i>I can't stand watching that Chen</i>
<i>bask in glory any longer.</i>

144
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,000
<i>Your father and I built</i>
<i>this hotel with our own hands.</i>

145
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
<i>But now everyone thinks it belongs to him.</i>

146
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,080
What did your aunt say?

147
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,360
She told me to come back immediately.
She said I can't keep studying.

148
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,120
Same with my mom.
She wants me back to work at the hotel.

149
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,440
So, what do we do now?

150
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,480
Marriage?

151
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,280
What is it, Madam?

152
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,319
Ranee won't return
unless I allow her to marry Rawee.

153
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
What did Rawee say?

154
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,960
He won't come back
unless we let him marry Ranee.

155
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,000
That girl again.

156
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,280
But they really love each other, Mom.
They've been dating for five or six years.

157
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,600
No! I said no!

158
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,000
If I let Ranee marry into that family,

159
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,280
it's like throwing her to the wolves.
I will never allow it.

160
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
No matter what, I'll never let
our family be tied to that family.

161
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,280
Fine. I'll stop sending him money.

162
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
Let's see how long he lasts.

163
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,360
Mr. Heng, how are you?

164
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,560
-I'm good.
-Great.

165
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,040
Just place the file there.

166
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,680
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

167
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,920
So, how's the marketing plan coming along?

168
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,200
HONGYOK GOLD SHOP

169
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,960
Please come in.

170
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

171
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,160
Thank you for visiting my shop again.

172
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,480
I promised I'd come, didn't I?

173
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,640
Didn't your husband come too?

174
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,320
He's still in a meeting with your husband.

175
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,760
Well, today I want
a matching gold necklace and bracelet set.

176
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,600
We've got plenty to choose from.
Let's look at bracelets first.

177
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,640
All right.

178
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,080
Can I ask you a favor?

179
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
Of course.

180
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,760
I saw someone
selling lod chong on the way here.

181
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,400
It looked delicious.
Could you go buy some for me?

182
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
Oh…

183
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,760
Please buy two, Korn.
I've been craving that too.

184
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,320
That shop's been open for ages.

185
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,240
-Let's look at the bracelets.
-Perfect.

186
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,280
This one just came in.

187
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,880
Right. I haven't seen this one before.

188
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,840
I can't take it anymore.

189
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,800
That man keeps stepping on our children,
keeping them beneath him.

190
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,600
He takes all the credit

191
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,240
and acts like he owns the hotel.

192
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,800
That's how Chen trains his people.

193
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,240
Trains? More like crushing them.

194
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,240
He's just doing what I taught him,

195
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,200
learning everything hands-on
so he truly understands the work.

196
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
I don't believe that.

197
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,160
He has ulterior motives.

198
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,840
I must stop him before the hotel
can't survive without him.

199
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,680
Then who would manage the hotel?

200
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,040
It'd have to be me again.

201
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
Rawee, of course.

202
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
I'm sure

203
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,760
he can do it and better than him too.

204
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,280
But what about his condition?

205
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
If he can't marry Ranee,
he won't come back.

206
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,520
Can you really accept that?

207
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,400
She's disappeared, as if she's died.

208
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,760
I wonder if my niece ever thinks of me.

209
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,360
I think you might have
to give in to her, Madam.

210
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
It's not that easy.

211
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,120
Here you go.

212
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,440
You want a chew? It helps relieve stress.

213
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,080
You go ahead.

214
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
The mail's here, ma'am.

215
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,640
Is there a letter from Ranee?

216
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,240
No, ma'am.

217
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,640
Then why didn't you say so right away?
Why let me get my hopes up like that?

218
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,480
I was just about to say it,
but you spoke first.

219
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,480
Hey?

220
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,680
Who knows how she's doing right now?

221
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,600
What do you think? Do you like it?

222
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,480
I do.

223
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
This is our new home.

224
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
So? Do you like it?

225
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,760
Yes.

226
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,880
Yes, but could you lower the rent a bit?

227
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,680
This is already a great deal.
It's close to the main road

228
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,520
and not far from Charoenrung Hotel.

229
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,680
You're from Bangkok.
You're probably not familiar with it.

230
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,000
That hotel
is the most famous in the province.

231
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,480
Then we'll take it, Auntie.

232
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,880
All right, there's a three-month deposit
required in advance.

233
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,560
But since you're newlyweds

234
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,160
just starting out, I'll give you
a discount. Just a two-month deposit.

235
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,640
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

236
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,280
I've got a big vegetable garden out back.

237
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,360
When you move in, help me take care of it.

238
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
You can take the extra veggies
to eat or sell. I'll give them to you.

239
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
Thank you very much.

240
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,320
Feel free to look around.

241
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,560
-Yes, Auntie.
-Yes, thank you.

242
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,320
I'm starting to lose patience with Chen.

243
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,400
Same here.

244
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,680
They're not training us.

245
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,040
They just want to grind us down.

246
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,760
I'm basically his assistant now,

247
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,520
carrying files and setting up meetings.
I haven't learned a thing.

248
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
I had it worse. I had to run around
pampering the wives of clients.

249
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,600
Today, I had to buy lod chong for them.

250
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,720
I'd never bought anything
from the street in my life.

251
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,640
Our family's richer than theirs.
How can they boss me around like that?

252
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm the hotel owner's son
and the deputy manager.

253
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,480
And he never introduces me to anyone.

254
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,720
Whenever we meet senior guests,
he hogs the spotlight and sends me away.

255
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,480
Hong's no better.
She never says a word in my defense

256
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,280
and keeps using me over and over.

257
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,440
NOW HIRING: MULTIPLE POSITIONS
INQUIRE INSIDE

258
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,280
Hello! A table for how many?

259
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,200
I'm here to apply for a job.

260
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,480
Please wait a moment.

261
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,320
He's not even our real brother.
He should have treated us well.

262
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,920
That's right. If it weren't for Dad,
I wouldn't have stayed this long.

263
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,600
Hong's getting worse by the day.

264
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm quitting.

265
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,480
And if you quit, what are you going to do?

266
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,040
I'm not going to work at the rice mill.
I hate it.

267
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,440
Rak.

268
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,040
Who did you see?

269
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,640
It's nothing. I thought I saw someone.

270
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,160
I think it's time Chen
returned to managing the rice mill.

271
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,680
I agree.

272
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,000
Eat a lot, okay?

273
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,680
You too.

274
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,840
I'm not a dog.

275
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,200
-Aren't you a dog?
-No. Just eat.

276
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,440
Who are you?

277
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,400
Miss!

278
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,160
I missed you so much.

279
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,040
I missed you so most too, Cha-aim.

280
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,760
I thought I'd never see you again
in this lifetime.

281
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,680
Of course, you would.

282
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,680
Why would you think that?

283
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,520
You gave Madam your ultimatum, didn't you?

284
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,880
That you wouldn't come back
unless she allowed you to marry Mr. Rawee.

285
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,720
So she really won't give in?

286
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Not exactly.
Her tone's getting softer every day.

287
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,080
Madam misses you so much.
She's lost a lot of weight.

288
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Don't tell her I'm back just yet, okay?

289
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
I won't.

290
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
I want you and Mr. Rawee
to get married too.

291
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,320
Rawee and I are lying low,
waiting for the right time

292
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,120
until both our mothers finally give in.

293
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,640
You can hide, but please
let me see you once in a while, all right?

294
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,960
I missed you so, so much.

295
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,840
Smells amazing.

296
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,720
Don't tell me you made all this?

297
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,320
Cha-aim snuck it out
of the kitchen back home.

298
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,200
You met Cha-aim?

299
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,240
Yes. I snuck over to the stable.

300
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,520
I just wanted
to catch a glimpse of Auntie.

301
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,120
But I bumped into Cha-aim instead.

302
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,720
Don't worry. She won't say anything.

303
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,800
Actually, Rak and Korn
almost saw me today too.

304
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm debating
whether I should just tell them.

305
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,280
-And did you tell them?
-I left before anyone could see me.

306
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,720
But it's a shame. That restaurant was
hiring for so many positions. I missed it.

307
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,760
With your hotel degree from the US,
do you think they'd hire you?

308
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,720
I was only going to show them
my high school diploma.

309
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,720
They'll know you from your last name.
Your family's famous in this province.

310
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,400
It's worth trying.

311
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,880
Maybe they'll take me as a temp worker.

312
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
You're doing so much for me.

313
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,400
I'll find a way to earn more too.

314
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,920
Let's eat first, okay?

315
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,040
Here you go.

316
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,200
If my mom and your aunt
still won't give in after all this…

317
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,360
once our two-month lease is up,

318
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,000
we might have to move
to Bangkok to find work.

319
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
All right.

320
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,120
You're really okay with that?
You won't regret this?

321
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,440
I won't. But I am a little hurt.

322
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
Hurt? Why?

323
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,480
You keep asking
if I'm scared, if I'm sure,

324
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,040
if I'll regret this over and over.

325
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,960
It's like you don't believe I love you.

326
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm sorry.

327
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Sorry isn't enough.
You need to be punished.

328
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,440
What punishment?

329
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,960
You'll wash the dishes,
fold the laundry, and iron the clothes.

330
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,920
And you'll mop the floor too.
I already swept.

331
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,720
You're ruthless.

332
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,480
I've got to stay sharp to keep up
with my cunning husband.

333
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,280
If you're going to work me this hard,

334
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,280
then when I get sore,
you'll have to give me a massage.

335
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,760
Come on.

336
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,080
-Thanks.
-All right.

337
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,840
I want to open a movie theater.
I'm quitting my job to help Dad.

338
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,560
I'll quit and help Mom
take care of the market and collect rent.

339
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,520
No. You have to marry Duangporn first.

340
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,960
The position of deputy hotel manager
sounds a lot more respectable.

341
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,240
That way, Duangporn's family
won't look down on you.

342
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,480
Then I'll hold out
and wait until after the wedding.

343
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,560
It's because of your son
from your old life.

344
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,000
He's the reason our kids
have to feel this uncomfortable.

345
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,680
Who wanted it to be this way?

346
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,960
It's our fault, Mom,

347
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,720
for doing things without consulting Dad.

348
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,320
Please don't blame him.

349
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,840
Always defending your father.

350
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,920
Then let's settle on this plan.

351
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,120
Settle on what?

352
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,679
Good timing.

353
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,560
I think the two of you
are getting too full of yourselves.

354
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,920
Did my little brothers come crying to you?

355
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,360
Are you playing dumb,
or are you just that clueless?

356
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,719
Just because your father
favors you doesn't mean

357
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,159
you can bully my kids however you want.

358
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
Madam, you've misunderstood us.

359
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,080
So when you let that woman

360
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,639
make me go buy lod chong for you,
that wasn't bullying?

361
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,600
What did that mean, then?

362
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
Seriously?

363
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,720
Ronnakorn Trongpanich
is the rightful heir to the hotel,

364
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,520
not some errand boy.

365
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,200
Have you two ever introduced us
as deputy hotel managers?

366
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,960
You deliberately keep me under you.

367
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,360
And to think we three siblings
let you live here.

368
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,840
If we hadn't accepted you,

369
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,360
you would've been shipped back
to your hometown a long time ago.

370
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,440
So what now?

371
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,440
Are you going to kick me out?

372
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Calm down, dear. They just misunderstood.

373
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,080
Let's talk when we're all calmer.

374
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,760
I agree with Hong.
Seeing my children fight like this…

375
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,680
is heartbreaking.

376
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,600
Then who started it, Dad?

377
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,440
All right. Let's not dwell on this.
We've had a long day.

378
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,040
Get some rest. Sleep it off.

379
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,120
We'll talk again in the morning.

380
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Let's go.

381
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,760
Settle everything
while there's still time.

382
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,080
The real manager of Charoenrung Hotel

383
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,880
is about to take charge.

384
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,160
Dear, wait for me.

385
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,120
So does that mean you're letting
Rawee and Ranee get married?

386
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,960
Don't start with me right now.

387
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,840
Worry about your own wedding first.

388
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,760
Yes, Mom.

389
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,320
Where have you lovebirds been?

390
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
We went to pick vegetables.
The landlord gave them to us.

391
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,920
We have plenty, Cha-aim.
I'm thinking of selling some.

392
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,640
So much trouble for the sake of love.

393
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,600
It's not trouble at all.
As long as it's honest work, I don't mind.

394
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,720
If Madam saw you two like this,

395
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,160
she'd definitely give in
and let you marry.

396
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,560
I hope she gives in soon.
We're nearly out of savings.

397
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,640
Your aunt's not the problem.

398
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,680
It's my mom I'm worried about.

399
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,520
Speaking of Madam Mei,

400
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,240
there's big news.
Mr. Rak is getting married!

401
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,920
Oh? Who's he marrying, Cha-aim?

402
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,880
Miss Duangporn,
the textile factory owner's daughter.

403
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,920
Auntie once brought me
to a party at their house. She's pretty.

404
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,800
Do you know when the wedding is?

405
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,920
Wishing you both
a long life together filled with love.

406
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,280
Thank you.

407
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Thank you.

408
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,400
May you be wealthy and prosperous,
with abundance to spare.

409
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,360
Thank you.

410
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,160
This way, please.

411
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,520
-Hello.
-This way, please.

412
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,440
I wish you and sister-in-law
lots of happiness,

413
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,960
a love that lasts forever, and a baby soon
so I can help take care of them.

414
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,240
Just one envelope, Mom?

415
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,400
Not enough? I'll add another one then.

416
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,360
Here.

417
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,600
Thank you, Dad.

418
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,280
May you both be happy together.

419
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,360
If things get hard, forgive each other.

420
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,000
When it's my wedding
and you're not as emotional,

421
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,880
I'll be upset with you, Ngor.

422
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,760
Of course, I'll be emotional.
I love all my young masters equally.

423
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,080
Too bad Rawee isn't here
to share this joy.

424
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,760
Indeed.

425
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,880
Thank you.

426
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,000
I've waited long enough.

427
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,800
Mr. Rak! My nephew's still here!

428
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,880
Close the door.

429
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
No one left now.

430
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,040
Mr. Rak, that tickles.

431
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,600
You're still up?

432
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,680
I was waiting for you.

433
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,520
Your shirt button came off.
I fixed it for you.

434
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,600
And what are you reading?

435
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,480
Old lecture notes.
I'm reviewing them so I don't forget.

436
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,200
So diligent.

437
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,000
So did you catch the wedding car in time?

438
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,120
Of course.

439
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,760
How was it?

440
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,120
Rak looked so sharp
I almost didn't recognize him.

441
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,840
And he was smiling the whole time.
He must be really happy.

442
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,240
I went to the market earlier

443
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,880
and overheard vendors say there's
a big banquet at the hotel tomorrow night.

444
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,240
Wow.

445
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,040
Mom really went all out.

446
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Well, he is her favorite son.
No surprise she's going all out.

447
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,960
And that's not all.

448
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,880
Tomorrow, there's going to be
a parade around town.

449
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,360
What kind of parade?

450
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,640
Thank you.

451
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,680
Is this part of the Chinese ceremony?

452
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,440
I wouldn't know. I've never seen
anything like it in my life.

453
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,880
It's all for showing off.

454
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,240
They're just trying to flaunt their wealth
like they're rich beyond measure.

455
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
These nouveau riche types.

456
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,360
Rak looks very handsome.

457
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,280
Let's not have a wedding like this, okay?
I'd be so embarrassed.

458
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,760
I'm not Mom's favorite.
She wouldn't go this far for me.

459
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,920
Was that Ranee?

460
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,520
What? Who?

461
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,720
That was Ranee.

462
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,840
-Where?
-Oh?

463
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,840
Maybe I was seeing things.

464
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,640
They're acting like celebrities.
So annoying.

465
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,680
I bet Madam's just worried her son
doesn't have as many connections as I do.

466
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,120
I still haven't forgiven Duangporn.

467
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,320
She betrayed me.
You have to get back at her for me.

468
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,800
Chan!

469
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,640
You're going to fall.

470
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,280
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

471
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,080
-Did they hire you?
-Of course!

472
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,840
They're short-staffed.

473
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,720
You're really something. You found
a way into your brother's wedding party.

474
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,880
It's an important moment in Rak's life.

475
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,760
I just wanted to be part of it,
even in a small way.

476
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,480
Just be careful. Don't get caught.

477
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,440
Don't worry. This vendor
is off the regular menu.

478
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,880
I won't be serving
the VIP tables or anything.

479
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,400
Anyway, I have to go to the restaurant.
You might have to head home alone.

480
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,480
-Okay.
-I'm off.

481
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,160
Wait, drink it first.
I ordered it for you.

482
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,760
I'm off then.

483
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,840
Cha-aim?

484
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,440
Auntie.

485
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,640
How could you do this to me?

486
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,240
Ranee!

487
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,560
-Ranee!
-Miss!

488
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,600
Where are you running off to now?

489
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,760
Dear.

490
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,960
You don't love me anymore, do you?

491
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,200
You're the only family I've ever had.

492
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,720
How could I not love you?

493
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,880
But you chose Rawee.

494
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,800
You're the one who made me choose.

495
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,920
Why can't I have both you and Rawee?

496
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,360
Five or six years
isn't enough to prove our love?

497
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,520
You hate Madam Mei.

498
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,320
What does that have to do with us?

499
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,760
I've just sent you a letter.

500
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,440
I've given up everything.
You can do whatever you want.

501
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,200
I'm ready to support you in anything.

502
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,000
Please promise you'll visit me
once in a while. Please.

503
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,800
Thank you.

504
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,760
Don't leave me again, my dear.

505
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,840
Tub.

506
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,320
That man looked so familiar.

507
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,600
I feel like I've seen him before.

508
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,160
Those Chinese boys look the same.

509
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,200
Was he more handsome than me?

510
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,680
You're the most handsome.

511
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,200
The three of them look the same.

512
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,360
They all have the same name… Young Master?

513
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,600
I think you're just mixing it up
with your dream.

514
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,640
You told me
about that dream once, remember?

515
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,760
-Did I?
-Yes.

516
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,320
Don't overthink it,
or you'll stress yourself out.

517
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,040
Let's go feed the horses.

518
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,200
Rassamee must be starving.

519
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,600
Right! I'm going now.

520
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,560
Let's go.

521
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,920
Rassamee!

522
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,760
If I give in that easily, I'll lose face.

523
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,000
It's their side

524
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,080
that needs to come and kneel, begging me
to take you as their daughter-in-law.

525
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,160
Will they agree to that?

526
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,760
Even if they don't want to,
they'll have to.

527
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,680
It's better than losing the hotel
to the ex-wife's child.

528
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,000
You mean Chen?

529
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,160
Yes. That boy's incredibly capable.

530
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,320
Everything he touches turns to gold.

531
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,760
When he ran the rice mill,
it kept expanding.

532
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,440
Now that he's managing the hotel,
it's booming.

533
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,440
Wealthy clients are booking banquet halls

534
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,600
even a year in advance.

535
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,840
Unlike Mei's other two kids. Useless.

536
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,480
No wonder Madam Mei
called Rawee back to work.

537
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,000
He's her last hope,

538
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,880
the only one she can use
to push Chen out of the picture.

539
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:53,120
That's why they'll definitely come begging
for you to be their daughter-in-law.

540
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,000
And what will you ask from them?

541
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,840
We absolutely cannot mess up
tonight's banquet.

542
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
Yes, sir.

543
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,760
Call in the staff from every department
involved in the banquet to my office now.

544
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,000
Yes, sir.

545
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,520
Why are you all staring at me like that?
You're making me nervous.

546
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,960
I haven't seen you eat food I made

547
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,680
in years.

548
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,320
Seeing you here today
for the first time again,

549
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,400
it's just exciting.

550
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,880
She's touched.

551
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
We won't stare anymore.

552
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,640
All right.

553
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,760
-Please go ahead and eat.
-All right.

554
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,240
Why didn't you invite
Mr. Rawee to join us?

555
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,760
He's not free today, Grandma.

556
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,360
Are you done yet? The guests are arriving.

557
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,160
Yes.

558
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,720
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

559
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,160
Please, come on in.

560
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,480
Congratulations.

561
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,640
Good evening.

562
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,920
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

563
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,280
-Good evening.
-Please come inside.

564
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,320
By the way, where's Mr. Chen?
I haven't seen him.

565
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,920
He's inside organizing everything. This is
big. He didn't want anything to go wrong.

566
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,560
I see. Congratulations.

567
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,000
Please, come in.

568
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,240
Right this way.

569
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,360
Today is my son's wedding banquet.

570
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,640
It's a family affair.
I believe you understand what I said.

571
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,320
You don't want me attending?

572
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,880
That's right. It's none of your business.
Stay out of sight.

573
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,240
Don't even think of stealing
the spotlight from my son.

574
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,400
You've already taken too much.

575
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,840
If you can't bear to see Rak shine,
then just go home.

576
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,800
Your son's wedding

577
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,920
will be the talk of the town.

578
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,840
There has been an explosion
at the Charoenrung Hotel.

579
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Rawee!

580
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,840
<i>The one who stands to lose power</i>

581
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,480
if you take over the hotel.
That's your prime suspect.

582
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,160
Submit your resignation today.
Don't stall any longer.

583
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,840
Chan, you remember that woman, right?
She hurt you before, right?

584
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,920
Don't pick some random girl.

585
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,600
I've already picked someone for you.

586
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,320
