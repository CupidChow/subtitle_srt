1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
<i>What kind of medicine is this, ma'am?</i>

2
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,800
It's a tonic for pregnancy.

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,840
Boil it and make Chan drink it every day.

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Yes, ma'am.

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
Madam!

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,440
Chan has stomach pains!

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>Who's that, Tub?</i>

8
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
He's the son of Madam's friend.

9
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,240
<i>-Who is he, Cha-aim?</i>
<i>-The son of Madam's friend.</i>

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
Is he trying to court her?

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,080
Are you Ranee's friend?

12
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
Not just a friend.

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
<i>I'm someone special to her.</i>

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
Rawee!

15
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
Mom!

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
I'll send Rawee abroad immediately.

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,880
You two won't ever see each other again.

18
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm not going to study abroad.
No matter what, I'm not going.

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
You dare defy me, Rawee?

20
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,080
It's because of that girl, isn't it?
Is that why you've changed so much?

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
I love Ranee.

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Don't talk nonsense about love.

23
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,040
Do you want to end up like your brother?

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,360
But we didn't do anything improper.

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Ranee is a well-mannered,
modest girl, Mom.

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,040
Then what was that kiss
in front of the stable?

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,520
Huh?

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,800
It always ends in bed.

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,640
I won't let another son

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
make the same mistake.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,440
I'll send you abroad immediately.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,960
Dad,

33
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I want to finish high school
here in Thailand first.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,560
I don't want to see you

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,320
repeat your brother's mistake.

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,760
Dad, you don't trust me anymore?

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,080
That girl made you lie to me.

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,600
You've been sneaking out
of the mill to see her every day.

39
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,160
Just because I didn't say anything
doesn't mean I didn't know.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm very disappointed in you, Rawee.

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,640
Did Chen tell you?

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Of course.

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,720
Did you think he loved you
and wanted to protect you

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,600
like a real brother? Don't be so naive.

45
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Your mom will make the final decision

46
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,160
about your studies.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,920
Dad, please listen to me.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Come here.

49
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,720
Go get ready.

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm sending you off as soon as possible.

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,200
Don't you dare do anything stupid
to disobey me again.

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
I will cut you off completely.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
I really wonder…

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,040
if you weren't a Trongpanich,

55
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,760
if you didn't finish school,
had no money or inheritance,

56
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,760
would that Pissamai
still give her niece to you?

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,680
Even if you love each other to death,

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,240
you'll never end up together.

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,280
Auntie.

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,160
Thanks for having my back out there.

61
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,680
You handled
the party gracefully until the end.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,440
It was my birthday.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
You threw that party for me.

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,760
How could I ruin it?

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,240
You're good with words.

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
I still can't get over it.

67
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,240
That foul-mouthed Mei.

68
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,080
How dare she speak so lowly of my niece?

69
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,920
Ranee.

70
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
Tell me the truth.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,720
Did you do what she said?

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
Everything happened
because of love, Auntie.

73
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,840
Rawee and I know our limits.

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,520
We've been mindful

75
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,280
and appropriate.

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
My dear…

77
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,520
you do know

78
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
this is impossible, don't you?

79
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Mei will never allow her son

80
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,720
to be with you.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
Just let him go.

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,160
It'll hurt less.

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,320
I love Rawee.

84
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
I don't think
I can stop loving him, Auntie.

85
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Even though you know
this relationship leads nowhere?

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
Yes.

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
And I believe

88
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Rawee feels the same.

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't know.

90
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
I've never understood love

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,640
the way you do.

92
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,080
I've never loved

93
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,320
any man in my life.

94
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,120
Apart from my parents,

95
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,440
you are the only one I love.

96
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,040
Listen, my dear.

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,440
I want the person I love most

98
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
to be happy.

99
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,600
That's why everything I say

100
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,320
and every warning I give

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,440
comes from love,

102
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,640
from my heart.

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Listen to me.

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
I know it's hard,

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
but let him go.

106
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,799
Stop loving him

107
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,159
and finish university.

108
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,480
I can assure you

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,960
you'll meet someone better

110
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
and more suitable for you than Rawee.

111
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,560
Trust me.

112
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
Trust me.

113
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,160
I'll try, Auntie.

114
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,120
It's okay, my dear.

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,480
<i>My dearest Ranee,</i>

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,840
<i>I must apologize</i>

117
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
<i>for what Mom said to you.</i>

118
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,520
<i>She just doesn't understand</i>
<i>how pure and beautiful our love really is.</i>

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,880
<i>It's not like what she thinks.</i>

120
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,400
<i>This time, it's really goodbye.</i>

121
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,080
<i>I can't delay my stay</i>
<i>in Thailand any longer.</i>

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
Miss.

123
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Miss.

124
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,640
This is a gift from Mr. Rawee.
Tub saved it for you.

125
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
Thank you.

126
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,640
<i>I don't know if your aunt</i>
<i>threw away the gift I sent.</i>

127
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>But I really wanted you to have it.</i>

128
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,640
<i>I picked it just for you.</i>

129
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,320
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>why I'm giving you this now.</i>

130
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,520
Why did he buy this now?
It's not even winter.

131
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
<i>I want this scarf</i>

132
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
<i>to act in my place.</i>

133
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,200
<i>To hold you,</i>

134
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
<i>to keep you warm…</i>

135
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
<i>just like I always wanted to do.</i>

136
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
<i>It's like I somehow knew</i>

137
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,800
<i>I'd be far away from you.</i>

138
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
<i>I don't know when I'll see you again.</i>

139
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
Would you like some?

140
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Tub.

141
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,720
Tub.

142
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,160
I know you've been avoiding me.

143
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,880
Chan.

144
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,960
Just because I helped you get justice

145
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,640
and become their daughter-in-law
like you always wanted

146
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,120
doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

147
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,680
I know you pitied me.

148
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,040
You didn't want to see me
get taken advantage of.

149
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,600
Good.

150
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
From now on, let's just
stay out of each other's way.

151
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,680
Wait, Tub.

152
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,760
Mr. Rawee asked me
to deliver this letter to Miss Ranee.

153
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,160
I've been waiting here for days.

154
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,760
I didn't dare bring it to the stables.
I was afraid of getting caught.

155
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,520
Mr. Rawee said

156
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,280
it's really important
and that it must reach Miss Ranee.

157
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Tub,

158
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,640
you have to help me.

159
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
What is it now?

160
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,160
Madam tried to poison me
to force a miscarriage,

161
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
but it didn't work.

162
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,120
I don't think she'll stop there.

163
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,640
I don't know what to do, Tub.

164
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
I'm scared.

165
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,840
Tell Mr. Rawee.

166
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,440
I don't think he'd believe me.

167
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,080
And even if I wanted to tell him,
it's already too late.

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
He's already gone abroad.

169
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,600
I won't survive for sure, Tub.

170
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
You have to help me.

171
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,840
I don't know what to do anymore.
I live in fear every night.

172
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,280
I don't know who else to turn to.

173
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,360
You're so annoying.
Can't you play somewhere else?

174
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,960
Come on. I was just trying
to help set the mood.

175
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,960
Music helps you concentrate
on your studies.

176
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
You didn't even say thank you,
and now you want to kick me out?

177
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,400
Yeah? Should I thank you now?

178
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,520
I've tolerated your noise for hours.

179
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,120
You're lucky I haven't thrown you out.

180
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,480
You're just studying basic language.
Don't stress.

181
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,800
You can't even understand it anyway.

182
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,040
Watch your mouth.

183
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,600
Let me beat you up just to relieve stress!

184
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,920
Did you order food?

185
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
No. Did you invite someone?

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
No.

187
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,720
-Wee!
-Wee!

188
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,079
Yeah!

189
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,520
I missed you!

190
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,839
Wow.

191
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave now.

192
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,880
I'll report back to Thailand.

193
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Thank you so much for arranging this.

194
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,680
My pleasure.

195
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,319
-Best of luck.
-Thank you.

196
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,640
Wow.

197
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,800
So how'd you end up here?

198
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,720
It's a long story.

199
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,560
That's okay.
We've got all day and night to hear it.

200
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
Let's go inside.

201
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Grab his bags too.

202
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,280
I missed you so much!

203
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,080
PISSAMAI FARM

204
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,000
There's a letter from overseas.

205
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Thank you.

206
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,400
Here you go.

207
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Your special refreshments.

208
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,480
Thank you.

209
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,560
There's a letter from a Thai lady.

210
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,560
I'm wondering who it's for.

211
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
That's mine.

212
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Hey.

213
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,240
Come on.

214
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,480
-What's that photo?
-Ranee was singing

215
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,800
-to welcome the new principal.
-Let me see.

216
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,840
Don't wrinkle it, okay?

217
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
Hey,

218
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,240
you're drooling.

219
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,480
I was just looking at it for a second.

220
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
-Smooch, smooch, smooch!
-Bro!

221
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,840
-Ranee, my darling!
-Come on, it'll get all wrinkled!

222
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,840
-Come on, let me see some more!
-No!

223
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,160
-Come on.
-Go sit over there!

224
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,240
Stop.

225
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,320
-Ngor.
-Yes, ma'am?

226
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I think this one needs a bigger pot.
This one's too small.

227
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,520
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,400
-Ngor.
-Yes, ma'am?

229
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,920
Chanraem's belly is huge now.
Is she about to give birth?

230
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,880
It should be any day now, ma'am.

231
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,240
Madam,

232
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,520
are you really going to accept her
as your daughter-in-law

233
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,440
and the baby as your grandchild?

234
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,360
What choice do I have?

235
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Things have come this far.

236
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,280
To me, they're no different from Chen.

237
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,640
I'll accept them,
but I won't call them family.

238
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,640
Such a shame about Mr. Rak.

239
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,160
He deserved a brighter future.

240
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,680
I won't let Rak stay trapped with her.

241
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,680
Have you found a way out, ma'am?

242
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,480
What's so hard about it?
I won't let him come back to Thailand.

243
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,840
He'll have to find work,

244
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,240
find a wife, and settle down over there.

245
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,240
But won't you miss him terribly?

246
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Of course I will. I miss him every day.

247
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,240
But I must let go, for his future.

248
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,440
Ngor, close up the house early tonight.

250
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,640
Master is at a banquet in Bangkok.
He'll be home late.

251
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Madam.

253
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,040
-Madam.
-What is it?

254
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,080
Looks like Chan is going into labor.
What should we do?

255
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,320
Then take her to the hospital.

256
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,360
Prajak went out with Master
and hasn't come back yet.

257
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,360
Then get her to my car.
I'll take her myself.

258
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,840
Chan, hang in there.

260
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,480
Don't give birth now.
I wouldn't know what to do!

261
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,840
I can't take it anymore, Auntie.

262
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,840
Please, let's just go now. Hurry!

263
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,120
We need to wait for Madam first.

264
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
Why do we have to wait?

265
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,520
Because she'll drive.

266
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,360
Prajak went with Master.
Madam is the only one who can drive.

267
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,240
Hold on.

268
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,920
Madam, please hurry.

269
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Her contractions
are getting closer and closer!

270
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,320
-Is she about to give birth?
-Yes, ma'am!

271
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,040
Why are you screaming?

272
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,640
Stop it right now! I can't focus!

273
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,840
My eyesight's already poor.
What if we crash and die?

274
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,840
Stop! Stop the car right now! Stop!

275
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,480
Stop? Why?

276
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Hey!

277
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Why stop?

278
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
I'm going to throw up!

279
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
Throw up?

280
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
-Ngor.
-Yes, ma'am?

281
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,400
Get her out of the car.
If she pukes in here, it'll be disgusting.

282
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,320
-Go.
-Yes, ma'am. Go.

283
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Go, Chan.

284
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
Slowly.

285
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
Go on.

286
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,960
Go.

287
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,560
Go.

288
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,680
Go.

289
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,640
Chan!

290
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,520
Where are you going to puke?
Just do it here!

291
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,160
Leave me alone!

292
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,480
Hey, where are you going?

293
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,200
You're going to get bitten by a snake!

294
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,040
Chan?

295
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,760
Chan?

296
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
-Madam.
-What is it?

297
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,400
Chan ran off into the forest.

298
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,560
Ran off? Why?

299
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,680
I don't know.

300
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,040
What should we do?

301
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,960
We have to find her! If she gives birth
out there, I'll be the one in trouble.

302
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
Yes.

303
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,640
Chan!

304
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
Where are you?

305
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,400
Come out, Chan!

306
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,320
Chan!

307
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,960
What the hell is wrong with her?

308
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,880
Go check over there, Ngor.

309
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,640
Yes, ma'am!

310
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Chan!

311
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,280
Chan! Where are you going?

312
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,760
Have you found her yet, Ngor?

313
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,960
Chan!

314
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,240
-Ngor.
-Yes, ma'am?

315
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
Just stop looking for her.

316
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,920
Oh?

317
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,360
Are you sure, ma'am?

318
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,120
I was driving her to the hospital,

319
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,440
and she just ran off like that.

320
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,680
If she doesn't want my help,
then let her be.

321
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,240
I think we should keep looking.

322
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,120
She's heavily pregnant.

323
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,280
I'm scared she might die
with the baby, ma'am.

324
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,400
Maybe fate…

325
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,080
is sparing Rak from misfortune.

326
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
Tub.

327
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,040
Tub, help me.

328
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,080
Tub…

329
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,840
Do you really want me
to stop searching for her?

330
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,200
Do you want people
to accuse me of murdering her?

331
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm terrified of gossip.

332
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,320
People twist lies into truth

333
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,240
and truth into lies.

334
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,520
Fine. Let's search for her one last time.

335
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,160
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
Chan!

337
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,440
Come with me to the hospital.

338
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,600
Chan!

339
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,360
Tub…

340
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,520
You're still up?

341
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,280
How could I sleep?

342
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,400
Chanraem caused more trouble again.

343
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,840
What happened this time?

344
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,600
She went into labor. I was worried,

345
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,120
so I drove her to the hospital.

346
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,960
But she just ran off without a word.

347
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
Where is she now?

348
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,720
I don't know.
Ngor and I searched for a long time.

349
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,000
Then I drove to the police station
to file a report and ask them to help.

350
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,240
Her water had already broken, sir.

351
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,120
I don't know how she's doing now.

352
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,840
Ngor, take Prajak
and go search for her again.

353
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,880
Yes, sir.

354
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Let's go.

355
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,720
There's Chan!

356
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,120
At least you're back safe.

357
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
Do you have any idea
how worried you made everyone?

358
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,880
You delivered the baby all by yourself.
That’s amazing.

359
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,320
Is it a boy or a girl?

360
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,720
Come on.

361
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Let me help carry the baby. Look at you.

362
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,000
Now go clean yourself up. Come on.

363
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,360
What is it?

364
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,159
Chan.

365
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,080
Chan.

366
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,840
We came to visit Chanraem.

367
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,960
Please, come in.

368
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,360
How is she doing?

369
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,200
Well…

370
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,800
The baby's fed now.

371
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,560
The baby's fed now.

372
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,880
He's asleep now. You can hold him.

373
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,840
Hong.

374
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,280
Where did your friends go?

375
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,600
They had to rush off to work.

376
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,840
Then please look after the baby for now.
I want to sleep.

377
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Stay with Daddy for a while, sweetie.

378
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,480
Take the baby, dear.

379
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,040
Sure.

380
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
I warned you, didn't I?

381
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,320
Why put yourself through that again?

382
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,200
Here to see the mess you made?

383
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,960
What do you mean by that?

384
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Exactly what I said.

385
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,480
Congratulations. You finally got rid
of the thorn in your side.

386
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,960
So you think I'm the one responsible
for Chanraem losing her baby

387
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,120
and losing her mind?

388
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,120
Don't you have a brain?

389
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,880
Both of you, calm down.

390
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,960
This won't help anything.

391
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,200
Dear.

392
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Don't defend your illegitimate child.

393
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,000
He hates me

394
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,440
and just wants someone to blame.

395
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,400
You can say whatever you want,

396
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,240
but you know the truth better than anyone.

397
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,280
That's right.

398
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,480
I know I went out of my way
to drive her to the hospital.

399
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Halfway there, she told me to stop

400
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,600
because she was about to throw up.
The moment I stopped, she ran off.

401
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,800
I had to leave the car
and chase after her with Ngor.

402
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,080
We searched everywhere but couldn't
find her, so I filed a police report.

403
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,120
That's what really happened.

404
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,280
This is the truth. I'll repeat it
a hundred times if I have to.

405
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,880
It's true. I can testify.

406
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,920
Like when you testified
in Hongyok's miscarriage case,

407
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,440
and they never found the culprit?

408
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,040
Stop it, Ngor.

409
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,960
There's no point arguing.

410
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,480
Might as well be talking to a wall.

411
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,840
I'm leaving, dear. I'm not
in the mood for a visit. Let's go, Ngor.

412
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,160
I wasn't there.

413
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,280
And Chan has lost her mind.

414
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,120
Believe what you want.

415
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,760
Maybe Madam really didn't do it.

416
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,400
No way.

417
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,960
People like her…
you never know what's on their minds.

418
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,080
Think about it.
Who stands to gain the most

419
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,720
from Chanraem ending up like this?

420
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,280
Isn't it her son Rak?

421
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,680
Now the path is clear.
When he returns from abroad,

422
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,480
he can marry some rich girl
without any more scandals.

423
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,240
That's true.

424
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,160
I'll be the karma

425
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,080
that haunts
every single one of her children.

426
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,680
<i>Please send my condolences to Rak.</i>

427
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,920
<i>Whether or not he loved Chanraem,</i>

428
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,800
<i>that child was still his flesh and blood.</i>

429
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,080
<i>Chanraem must've been so shocked</i>
<i>that it affected her mind.</i>

430
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,880
<i>But when I visited her,</i>

431
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,440
<i>she wasn't completely gone.</i>

432
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,320
<i>Just parts of her memory are missing.</i>

433
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,960
<i>I believe that with love</i>

434
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,200
<i>and proper care,</i>

435
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,320
<i>she'll gradually get better.</i>

436
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,200
No matter what,
I'm not going back to marry a crazy woman!

437
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,360
She's not that crazy.

438
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,240
Still crazy enough. I'm out.

439
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,080
So is Mom still
letting her stay in the house?

440
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,080
Ranee didn't say, but I think she is.

441
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,480
Poor girl.

442
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,280
I hope she recovers.

443
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
You two should be happy for me

444
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,440
that everything's over.

445
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,360
I don't have to marry a maid
and raise a kid with her.

446
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,240
-But you--
-Don't say anything.

447
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,760
I don't want to hear it.

448
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,520
I'm in a foul mood.

449
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,680
Brother. Brother!

450
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,440
This is pla grim.

451
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,680
And this is khai tao.

452
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,960
Wow.

453
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,200
My favorite!

454
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,120
I haven't had this in ages.
You rarely make it anymore.

455
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,360
Oh,

456
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,680
Madam.

457
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,240
Making pla grim khai tao

458
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,920
is twice the work.

459
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,920
You've got the pla grim then the khai tao.

460
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,320
It's exhausting.

461
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,480
Well, well.

462
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,960
You're ready with the bowl, miss?

463
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,640
All right, all right.

464
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,760
There you are, Tub.

465
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,240
Somneuk is taking leave this Monday.

466
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,080
Can you drive Ranee to school?

467
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,800
-Yes, ma'am.
-Grandma.

468
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,880
Come on, serve it already.
We've been waiting long enough.

469
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,880
Madam.

470
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,640
Yes?

471
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,240
I have something I'd like to discuss.

472
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,920
What is it?

473
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,040
I'd like to get married.

474
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,600
Oh, my, Tub.

475
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,120
Hey.

476
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,760
He's not proposing to you.

477
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,760
Which girl do you want me
to propose to on your behalf?

478
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,560
Chanraem.

479
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,240
-Which Chanraem?
-The maid at Madam Mei's.

480
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,840
You're marrying that crazy woman?

481
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,200
I pity her. I want to take care
of her until she's well again.

482
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,800
Chanraem is a daughter-in-law
of that household, Tub.

483
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,880
But they never officially married,

484
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,680
and the baby she carried is gone.

485
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
That means
there's no real tie binding them.

486
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So,

487
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
will you help me propose to her, ma'am?

488
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Cha-aim? What's wrong with you now?

489
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,960
I think you can propose to her yourself.

490
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,960
That wretched Mei will probably
serve her up on a golden platter.

491
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,520
Might even throw in some gold.

492
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,320
Just be careful you don't end up
a scapegoat without realizing it.

493
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,120
Should I come back
for your answer another day?

494
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,920
Can't you wait for a minute or two?

495
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,920
You're just like your master.

496
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,920
I don't object to it.

497
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,920
I'll give you some money
as a wedding gift for her treatment.

498
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,400
She's one of mine, after all.

499
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,840
I'd like to thank you
on Chanraem's behalf.

500
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,800
In that case,
may I take her with me today?

501
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,600
I'll take you to her.

502
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,560
I'm sorry your plan didn't work out.

503
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,360
You wanted to use your child to make money
and claim it was mine, didn't you?

504
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,880
Karma's come for you.

505
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,560
Luckily, they didn't both die
in childbirth.

506
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,640
Come now. Hurry up!

507
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,200
<i>Everything's taken care of here.</i>

508
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,360
<i>Hurry and finish your bachelor's degree,</i>

509
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,800
<i>and I'll find you a good wife,</i>

510
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,760
<i>one who'll elevate your status.</i>

511
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,880
She's here!

512
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,400
Our Young Miss is home.

513
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,440
What are you afraid of?

514
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,240
It's Miss Ranee, not some stranger.

515
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,680
You see her every weekend. Come on.

516
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,080
No, I don't want to.

517
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,600
Everyone's here waiting.

518
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,560
I graduated!

519
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,680
It's beautiful, Grandma.

520
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,520
I made it myself, with my own hands.

521
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,640
I'm so happy for you.

522
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,960
You're the best.

523
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,400
Thank you, Grandma.

524
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,640
And she didn't just graduate.

525
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,480
She ranked number one in her class.

526
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,000
You're amazing, miss.

527
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,200
That's enough. You're making me blush.

528
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,360
You deserve it. You're really smart.

529
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,720
So, what's the reward from Madam?

530
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,240
I didn't get anything.

531
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,440
What do you want?

532
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,920
Will you give me anything?

533
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,200
Anything but the Moon and stars, maybe.

534
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,440
Anything else, I'll try to get it for you.

535
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,360
There's only one thing I want.

536
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,960
Nothing else.

537
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,960
What is it?

538
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,080
I want to study abroad.

539
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,920
Thank you, Auntie.

540
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,920
You're the best!

541
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,320
This reminds me
of coconut ice cream back home.

542
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah. With sticky rice
and peanuts? The best.

543
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,120
If you don't want it,
I'll help you eat it!

544
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,840
Korn!

545
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,280
Give it back!

546
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,760
Ranee?

547
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,120
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

548
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,280
FIVE YEARS LATER

549
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,800
Welcome home, Son.

550
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,480
Thank you, Mom.

551
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,800
I'm so proud of you

552
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,800
for never giving up.

553
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,520
You've earned
your degree and returned home.

554
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,320
From now on,
you'll be the pillar of our family.

555
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,360
This is your reward from me.

556
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,080
Thank you, Dad.

557
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,200
Three, two.

558
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,000
Thank you.

559
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,680
One more shot, please.

560
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,440
Get some rest.

561
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,760
Stay here at the hotel.
It's convenient here.

562
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,760
No need to go home.

563
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,960
Let's meet at dinner tonight.

564
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,320
Any more surprises for me?

565
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,120
I don't know. Ask your mother.

566
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,960
Just dress up nicely.
You won't be disappointed.

567
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,520
I think I can guess.

568
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,640
Don't run off like when you were young.

569
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,960
Not anymore, Mom. This time,

570
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,640
I'll run straight at her.

571
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,360
Watch your mouth.

572
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,840
Well, how's Chanraem?

573
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
Why bring her up?

574
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,480
I'm just wondering.

575
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,120
No need.

576
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,720
She and her husband tricked all of us.

577
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,080
Everyone knows now.

578
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,360
Don't bring it up again.

579
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,560
I'm sorry, Mom.

580
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,600
Erase her from your memory.

581
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,120
Just think she never existed.

582
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,680
Yes, Mom.

583
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,560
Stay with your dad for now.

584
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,800
I have errands to do.

585
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,640
Don't forget to dress up.

586
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,400
Yes, Mom.

587
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,080
Let's talk.

588
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,080
Here you go, Dad.

589
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,160
I'm thinking of giving you the hotel.

590
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,000
What do you think?

591
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,400
Really, Dad?

592
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,040
You have a hotel degree.

593
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,080
You want this, don't you?

594
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,880
Yes, Dad.

595
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,640
-Good, good.
-Thank you, Dad.

596
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,040
Here's your favorite.

597
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,840
Enjoy it, Rassamee.

598
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,840
You want more?
I'll give you a little more.

599
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,600
Chanraem.

600
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,120
Yes?

601
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,680
Guess who's back from abroad.

602
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,160
Who?

603
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,840
Mr. Rak.

604
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,920
Who is he?

605
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,600
Who else?

606
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,960
-He was--
-Cha-aim!

607
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,840
Why did you say that?
That'll only bring trouble.

608
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,760
I'm trying to help her regain her memory.

609
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,440
Look at her.

610
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,600
She's just like us now.

611
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,400
She's almost normal.

612
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,320
Just a bit more memories
and awareness and she'll be fine.

613
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,560
I was only trying to help.

614
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,160
Are you sure it's helping?

615
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,360
Some things are better forgotten.

616
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,800
If you're done, then leave.

617
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,480
And stay out of her business
unless it's absolutely necessary.

618
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,880
Are you afraid
she'll remember who she loved

619
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,960
and leave you again?

620
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,280
Who's Mr. Rak?

621
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,400
I don't know.

622
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,880
Cha-aim was just rambling.

623
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,680
Keep feeding the horse.

624
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,080
All right.

625
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,840
Did you finish it, Rassamee?
I'll give you a bit more.

626
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,320
Hey? It's almost gone.

627
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,760
Take more.

628
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,720
I have three sons.
Do you think none of them

629
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,560
can do better than someone

630
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,400
as uneducated as you?

631
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,000
<i>I'm your son too.</i>
<i>Why does he get always get more than me?</i>

632
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,480
<i>Can you promise me one thing?</i>
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

633
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,000
that you'll marry me.

634
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,560
Get out! Get out!

635
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,600
Do you both know about this?

636
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,560
What happened?

637
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,760
If you want my help,
we need to make a deal.

638
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,120
What do you want? Say it.

639
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,040
