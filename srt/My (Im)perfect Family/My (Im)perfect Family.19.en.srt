1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Have you considered a political career?

2
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm not much of a talker.
I don't think I could handle it.

3
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,080
Bancha's trying to get Korn into politics.

4
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Korn?

5
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,440
- Aren't you going to warn him?
- What for?

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,920
<i>If he gets conned and loses money,</i>
<i>that's his bad luck.</i>

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,720
<i>How many guests have canceled so far?</i>

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,160
<i>Nearly half.</i>

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,120
If this keeps up,
we're in serious trouble.

10
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,760
You've been scammed. These are fakes.

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,440
How dare you
try to trick us with fake jewelry!

12
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,080
When will you shut up?!

13
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,960
I said I didn't go to a brothel!

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
Stop, Rak.

15
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
Mom!

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,520
You've been lying on your back
for too long. Time to lie on your side.

17
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
Don't touch me.

18
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,560
Don't be stubborn.

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Be gentle! That hurts!

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,280
Be gentle! It hurts!

21
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
Just a little bit, Mom.

22
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,520
Serves you right.

23
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,400
Take a nap, okay? You can eat
and take your medicine after you wake up.

24
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
Stop fussing over me and get out.

25
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,600
I can't. I'll wait until you've eaten
and taken your medicine.

26
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Then go get it now.

27
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,040
I'll eat just to get it over with.

28
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,640
I can't stand seeing your face.

29
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,240
Sure.

30
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,120
So annoying. I hate her guts.

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,400
Are you going back?

32
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,400
Yes.

33
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,080
I'll find a night nurse
to take care of Mom.

34
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Just from evening until morning is fine.
I'll take over in the morning.

35
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
You'll come every day?

36
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,360
Yes. It's not fair
to leave her to a nurse all the time.

37
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,160
Having her daughter-in-law
to scold might help her vent.

38
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
Mom's had dinner and her medicine.

39
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll get going now.

40
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
Thanks.

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Ning, I'm heading to the hospital.

42
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
Once you finish the accounts, close up.

43
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,160
Yes.

44
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,800
I only managed to get one tray.
I was scared I'd get caught.

45
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,480
I'll give you half the price we agreed on.
Hot goods like this need to be moved fast.

46
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,360
Okay. These are the item codes and prices.

47
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,920
Can you pay now? I need to leave quickly.

48
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
Gosh, you're back so late.

49
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,440
So? Did that old witch throw a fit?

50
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
Of course she did.

51
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,960
Why bother serving someone
who only yells at you? I don't get it.

52
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,400
‪She's Rawee's mother anyway.

53
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,480
Just think
I'm trying to support my husband.

54
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,520
He's already overloaded with work.

55
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
All right.
Go take a shower and rest, dear.

56
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,920
Okay.

57
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,960
Oh, you're back?

58
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes.

59
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,560
What was the outcome of the meeting?

60
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,320
Well, we'll add more freebies
but no discounts on room rates.

61
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm not sure it'll work, but we'll try.

62
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
How's Mom?

63
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,000
I think there's no brain injury.

64
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,920
She's still scolding like always.

65
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
What a relief.

66
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,280
But she'll need a long time to recover.

67
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,080
A lot of her muscles were injured.

68
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,200
She has back pain,
hip pain, and a sprained leg.

69
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,720
She can't walk yet.

70
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,640
She must've fallen down quite a few steps.

71
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,800
Yes.

72
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,480
But she's lucky it's not worse.

73
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,920
Don't worry.

74
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,240
I'll take care of her for you.

75
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,200
Thank you.

76
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Come on, let's eat.

77
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,280
Later. Let me cuddle you first.

78
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,080
Mom getting hurt
made me realize something.

79
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,680
What is it?

80
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,680
We should have a daughter.
So, when we're sick,

81
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,920
she can take care of us.

82
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't think it matters
if it's a son or daughter.

83
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,400
Any child can care for their parents.

84
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Honestly,
I can speak for my brothers on this.

85
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,280
All three of us kids want to care for Mom.

86
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,160
But…

87
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,280
we're too afraid.

88
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,240
We don't dare.

89
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,120
How can I describe it?

90
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,680
Terrified?

91
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,160
Traumatized? Something like that.

92
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
We grew up with her cane,

93
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,720
her scolding, her shouting.

94
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,840
Never once were we enough.

95
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,440
We're just scared.

96
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm not blaming her.

97
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,120
But if I ever have a child,
I'd never raise them that way.

98
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,800
Then let's not have kids.
Raising them is tough.

99
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,680
I'll take care of you
when you're sick, then.

100
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,040
Just make sure my nurse is handsome.

101
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,840
No one's more handsome than me.

102
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,320
You're too cute.

103
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,800
We don't need dinner anymore.

104
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,720
What made you buy a gold necklace for me?

105
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,160
I made a little profit.

106
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,000
You gambled again?
Didn't you learn from last time?

107
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,200
I did. This time, I just played for fun.

108
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,560
I had a budget. I quit when I got bored.

109
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,120
I hope that's true.

110
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,640
Well…

111
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,760
You're trying to bribe me with a necklace
because you're hoping for the gold bar?

112
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,400
You see right through me.
Why not grab the chance when you can?

113
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,840
Who said I didn't do it?

114
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
My wife…

115
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,920
has got real skills.

116
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
What kind of siblings are they?

117
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,000
Anyone out there? I need to pee.

118
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,960
Rak! Duangporn! I need to pee.

119
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,880
Can anyone hear me?

120
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,440
Rak!

121
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
Madam!

122
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,280
Madam!

123
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
What is it?

124
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Madam Mei's calling for you and Master.

125
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,000
- Why would she call?
- Looks like she needs to pee.

126
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,000
Then why tell me? You go help her!

127
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,240
No. I'm scared.
I can't get near her again.

128
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,720
Otherwise, I quit.

129
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,080
All right. Don't threaten me.

130
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,160
She's probably wet herself by now.

131
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm not cleaning up after her.
She's not my mom.

132
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,600
So we just leave her to sleep like that?

133
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,080
Where's Mr. Rak?
Is he still out finding a nurse?

134
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,640
Yes.

135
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,400
Then pretend we didn't hear anything.
Let the beloved son deal with it.

136
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,240
- Go to bed.
- Okay.

137
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,440
You're alone today?

138
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,680
My friend's on the way.

139
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
I'll find you a seat.

140
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,520
What's wrong?

141
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Who's this?

142
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,880
A former singer here.
Big hit with the guys. She left.

143
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,880
- What's her name?
- Chomechawee.

144
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,760
She got a new husband
and moved out of town.

145
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,440
She's living a comfortable life now.

146
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,280
New husband?
That means she had a previous husband?

147
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,200
Yeah. Chat, one of the bouncers.

148
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,000
She dumped him once she got the rich guy.

149
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,480
Why do you ask? Are you into her?

150
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,440
I just thought I recognized her.

151
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,080
Do you have a photo of her ex?

152
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,280
WANTED

153
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
IF YOU SEE THIS MAN, PLEASE REPORT HIM
THE BAR IS OFFERING A REWARD

154
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
Why is he wanted?

155
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,320
He stole money from the bar and ran.

156
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,160
Is Madam awake yet?

157
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,040
I don't know. I didn't dare go in.

158
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,400
It's okay.

159
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,920
He came home drunk.

160
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,320
He probably didn't want to go upstairs
and argue with Madam again.

161
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,440
If a customer comes, wake him up.
It doesn't look good.

162
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,680
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,920
Mom?!

164
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,280
I'll go prepare breakfast now.

165
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
Ning's not here yet?

166
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Not yet. But Ms. Ranee's already here.

167
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,360
That woman's got stamina.

168
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,640
Where did all the jewelry go?

169
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,280
Rak. Rak.

170
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,240
Are you planning to sleep your life away?

171
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,760
Rak, get up.

172
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,840
Are you drunk again?

173
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,800
Do you even know where the jewelry went?
Did you sell it?

174
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,240
Sell what? No one's buying.
People only come to sell.

175
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
Then why is it all gone?

176
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,320
Gone?

177
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
Look.

178
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,440
But it was all there yesterday!

179
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,160
Ning, I'm heading to the hospital.
Close up when you finish the accounts.

180
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,400
Yes.

181
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,360
I'd like to speak with Ning,
Room 346, please.

182
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,640
What? She left?

183
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,040
She didn't even pay rent?

184
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,640
That damn Ning!

185
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,040
If they haven't found a private nurse yet,
I can stay and look after you tonight.

186
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Good thing you didn't hit the table
or bedframe last night,

187
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,760
or it could've been worse.

188
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,240
You talk too much.
Stay if you want. You're annoying.

189
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,640
Why are you smiling?

190
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,840
Nothing.

191
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,640
And don't you dare go
running your mouth to Rak

192
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,920
that I fell getting out of bed.

193
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,040
He'll worry and think
he didn't take good care of me.

194
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,800
He's already stressed from work.

195
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,840
Can I tell him…

196
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,120
- about the wet bed?
- Hey!

197
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,400
You little brat.
I'm not eating. Bring me my medicine.

198
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
- Just one more bite.
- No!

199
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,960
I found a private nurse.
She'll start tonight.

200
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,800
Great. Now this annoying girl can go home.

201
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,840
She's annoying.

202
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,480
But during the day,
Ranee will still help take care of you.

203
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,960
The nurse isn't available yet.

204
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,560
Then find someone else.

205
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
It's not easy, Mom.
I need to take anyone I can find now.

206
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm happy to help.

207
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm heading to the police station.

208
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,640
What? Why?

209
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,840
Ning stole one tray of our jewelry.

210
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,600
Oh, no! That's awful.

211
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,320
Is there enough cash left
to keep the shop going?

212
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,160
Misfortune after misfortune…

213
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,720
Call home. I want to talk to Ngor.

214
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,960
Yes.

215
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,920
What an honor to meet
the general manager himself.

216
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,040
What brings you here?

217
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,560
To see what you've done?

218
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
Your hotel's lively.

219
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,640
Drop a coin in the lobby

220
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
and it echoes outside.

221
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you're done seeing Dad's hotel struggle

222
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
because of you,

223
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,400
then leave.

224
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,840
I can't leave just yet.

225
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,720
I have to make sure
my client is taken care of.

226
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,360
You probably don't know,

227
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,680
but your banquet hall
was booked last minute today

228
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,600
because mine was full.

229
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,000
I recommended them this place.

230
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,640
If you're really struggling
but too embarrassed

231
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,080
to ask for help,

232
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
just call me.

233
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,280
I'll send some customers your way.

234
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,840
Better not. You'll lose your customers
once they experience our service.

235
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,560
Why wouldn't I know?
I managed this place before.

236
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,440
Our services are not different.

237
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Same service manual.

238
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,920
It's different.

239
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,040
Staff with higher pay and better benefits

240
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,920
give better service than those

241
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
stuck with stingy bosses who underpay them

242
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,720
and make them worry for their survival.

243
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,480
And my HR just told me

244
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,320
there's a stack of job applications
from your hotel staff waiting on my desk.

245
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,000
That should be obvious.

246
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,320
As for your banquet clients, don't worry.

247
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
I'll treat them so well,

248
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,160
they'll never want to go elsewhere.

249
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,040
Don't worry.

250
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
Let's see how long you can keep that up.

251
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,280
Ngor, go get my bank book in my drawer.

252
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
You know where I hide the key, right?

253
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,240
Then have Prajak take it to the bank

254
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,360
and bring back
the authorization documents.

255
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
Bring it all
to the jewelry store in Bangkok.

256
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,440
Bring it today.

257
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,360
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,600
Thank you, Mom. Without your help,
I wouldn't know what to do.

259
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,960
New businesses are like this.
It's trial and error.

260
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,280
You'll be fine in no time.

261
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,480
All right?

262
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Yes, Mom.

263
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,880
Where has it gone to?

264
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
Korn, there's a call for you.

265
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,440
Okay.

266
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,120
Are you going out?

267
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,480
Yes. I'm going to Bangkok
to shop for stage clothes.

268
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,800
How are you getting there?

269
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,000
Chat will drive me there.

270
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,880
New gold necklace?

271
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,200
Yes.

272
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,320
It was a gift for myself.
It's pretty, isn't it?

273
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,840
Go answer the phone.

274
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,400
Who is it?

275
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,120
Ngor.

276
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,760
I'll see you at the bar tonight.

277
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
Yes, Ngor?

278
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm really worried, sir.

279
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
What's wrong?

280
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,200
I suspect Master Rak is trying
to squeeze more money from Madam again.

281
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
Please don't tell her I said anything.

282
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,320
So how much did she give?

283
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,760
I don't know yet.

284
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm going to push through one more month.
If it doesn't work, I'm quitting.

285
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,720
I don't want to lose more.

286
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't want to fail.

287
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
You think I want to fail?

288
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,280
I'm the eldest. I don't want to be
embarrassed in front of my siblings.

289
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,680
It's better to fail than go broke.

290
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,520
Don't go blabbing about this.

291
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,920
About what?

292
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,400
About me helping Rak.

293
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
I won't. It's not my business.

294
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
That's good.

295
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,880
We've had enough of the sibling conflict.
They don't even look at each other now.

296
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
If you want to fix it,
you need to fix the cause.

297
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,800
Exactly. Their dad's inheritance

298
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,040
is the cause of the conflict,

299
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,240
not me.

300
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
Dead quiet.
Not even an ant came through the door.

301
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,000
Rumors sure travel fast.

302
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,920
We can't just wait for mercy
from the heavens. We need to do something.

303
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,320
Are you sure it won't make things worse?

304
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,000
It can't get any worse than this.

305
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,440
Heaven showed us some mercy!

306
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,040
What are you doing here?

307
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,600
Mom's sick, so I came to visit her.

308
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Where is she?

309
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,200
Upstairs.

310
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,840
Did you bring what Mom asked for?

311
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,760
The bank papers?

312
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,640
Here they are.

313
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,240
No need. I can feed myself.
Just hand me the fork.

314
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,520
What are you doing here?

315
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,360
You're sick. Of course I came to visit.

316
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Spare us the noble act.
He's here for other reasons.

317
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Might as well make the trip worthwhile.

318
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,240
I ran into Prajak at the bank.

319
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
So you're giving Rak more money again?

320
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,680
How much will it take
to fill this bottomless pit, Mom?

321
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,920
This is why Rawee is upset

322
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,640
and doesn't come home anymore.

323
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
The shop was robbed.

324
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,280
What do you expect me to do?
Just sit and watch my son go under?

325
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
He failed to run the place.

326
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,240
Do you really need to help him
and go broke?

327
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,200
Hey. Watch your mouth.
I'm your older brother.

328
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,520
Enough. What do you want?

329
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Whatever you give him, I want the same.

330
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,520
Do you want it too?
You can claim your husband's share too?

331
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,280
Rawee wouldn't want that.
I can answer for him.

332
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,800
What are you going to use the money for?

333
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,360
I'm going into politics.

334
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,840
Are you insane? I don't approve.

335
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
You've never approved
of anything I've done.

336
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,040
Because you keep choosing things I hate.

337
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,960
I'll quit the bar, leave Chomechawee,

338
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,080
and marry the daughter
of a high-ranking official.

339
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,120
Will that make you happy?

340
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,159
Are you serious?

341
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,360
I have to.

342
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,800
Mr. Bancha told me I need to change

343
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,240
and clean up my image if I want to win.

344
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,400
I need the money too.

345
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,800
You daughters-in-law, leave.
I want to talk to my sons.

346
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,040
I can't tell if you're dumb or what.
You turned down free money.

347
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,560
I wouldn't know what to use it for.

348
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,480
Of course not.
With the businesses you're managing,

349
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,160
I'm sure you've got more than enough.

350
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,560
Rawee and I haven't caused
any drain on the family's money.

351
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,520
So you're saying
we're the ones wasting the family fortune?

352
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,520
You said that yourself.

353
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,800
Keep living off old glory while you can.
Just pray you don't go under.

354
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,000
How much do you want?

355
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,520
Like I said.
Whatever you give Rak, I want the same.

356
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,680
- Isn't that a bit much?
- Ask yourself first.

357
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,160
Don't fight.

358
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,560
I'm not spending your money.

359
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
I just want to help safeguard it

360
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,840
before it all gets blown.

361
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,560
Hey, Korn, watch your mouth.

362
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,320
Shut it, both of you,
if you want any money.

363
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,520
Just because I'm giving you money

364
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,720
doesn't mean I approve
of your political stunt.

365
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,280
But I hate your bar
and your girlfriend more.

366
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,320
I'm exchanging what I hate more
for what I hate less.

367
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,960
Who's this?

368
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,560
A former singer here.
Big hit with the guys. She left.

369
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,760
What's her name?

370
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,920
Chomechawee.

371
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,720
Rak, how much money do you need?

372
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,480
You want it or not?

373
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,800
How much do you need?

374
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,000
New husband?
That means she had a previous husband?

375
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah. Chat, one of the bouncers.

376
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,800
She dumped him once she got the rich guy.

377
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,520
Why are you staring at me?

378
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,240
Are you so mad at me
that you want to punch me in the face?

379
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,480
Do it. Mom's not watching.

380
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,280
I just wanted to tell you something.

381
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,200
What is it?

382
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,520
Hurry and transfer the money
to my account. I need it.

383
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,880
I know.

384
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,840
They're breaking up anyway.
There's no point saying it.

385
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Poor guy doesn't even know
he's being cheated on.

386
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,720
Rawee,

387
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,120
come talk to me for a second.

388
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,720
Yes, Auntie.

389
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,600
What's the matter?

390
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,760
I'm thinking of holding our annual party
at the horse track again.

391
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,920
I haven't done it in years
because it's exhausting.

392
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,240
But this year, I want to do it for fun.

393
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,440
I told my friends in the association,

394
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,000
and they're all

395
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,960
eager to attend.

396
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,000
That sounds great.

397
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,600
So I'd like your help

398
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
booking the hotel.

399
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
There'll be hundreds of us
in the association,

400
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,800
and I want it to last for three days,

401
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,640
so bookings
for maybe three or four nights.

402
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,800
Thank you so much, Auntie.

403
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
I'm doing what I can.

404
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,560
Events like this don't happen often.

405
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,080
Just that alone

406
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,560
is a lifeline for our hotel.

407
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,400
It'll lift our staff's morale too.

408
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,440
Thank you on behalf of all our employees.

409
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,040
Keep working hard, Rawee.

410
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,160
I believe good, honest,

411
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,960
and hardworking people

412
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,280
will be protected.

413
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,320
As for those scheming to destroy you,
they'll fall to their own traps.

414
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,480
Yes.

415
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,400
Keep fighting.

416
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
I will.

If I were in pain, would I be walking?

You're doing great. Let's go all the way.

423
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,920
Be careful, Mom.

424
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,120
Let go of me.

425
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,040
Even with the discount,
it's still dead quiet.

426
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
Maybe people don't know about it yet.

427
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,960
Duangporn?

428
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,000
Are you feeling nauseous?

429
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,240
Where are you going?

430
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm going to the bathroom.

431
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,760
Let's go then.

432
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,640
No need. I can go myself.

433
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,560
You still need to be careful.

434
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,440
You've almost recovered.
Otherwise, you'll need to start over.

435
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,520
You're worried because you don't want
to come take care of me again, right?

436
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,760
Yes.

437
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,680
- Come, I'll help.
- Such a bother.

438
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,480
Slowly now.

439
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,040
Let's go.

440
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,800

Let's wait until the discount's deeper.

444
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,920
I'm just afraid
others will snatch everything up first.

445
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,080
No way.

446
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,000
Who would dare?

447
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,720
Mom.

448
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,880
I'm heading back home today.

449
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,520
I have lots to take care of.

450
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,720
I'll probably stay over there
for a night or two.

451
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,720
All right, Mom.

452
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,640
- Are you taking her back?
- Yes.

453
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,360
You don't have to come anymore.
I've recovered.

454
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,040
I'll be so lonely without you.

455
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,520
Then go take care of your husband.

456
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,880
Do you want anything?

457
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,800
I've been craving sour stuff lately.

458
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,800
Just like me when I was pregnant with Rak.

459
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,440
I had intense morning sickness
and craved sour foods all day.

460
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,800
I bet you're having a boy.

461
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,680
I'll bring some treats back for you.

462
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,760
Thank you, Mom.

463
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,920
- I'm heading out.
- Safe travels.

464
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,040
All clear. Time to party with the girls.

465
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,480
Ms. Tipsuda has arrived.

466
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,120
All right.

467
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,120
Who the hell are you?!

468
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,880
Why are you on my bed?!

469
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,040
Get out!

470
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,360
You filthy husband!

471
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,200
- Duangporn!
- Yes, it's me!

472
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,160
- Let go.
- You sick bastard.

473
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,160
Maybe I should just cut it off.
That might stop you.

474
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,960
Let go of me. It hurts!

475
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,160
Die now!

476
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,000
Duangporn!

477
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,840
- Duangporn.
- Get out!

478
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,600
Who's calling at this hour?

479
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,520
Hello, Madam Mei's residence.

480
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,160
<i>It's me, Rak. Let me speak to Mom.</i>

481
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,480
Yes.

482
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
It's Mr. Rak, ma'am.

483
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,800
<i>Mom, Duangporn fell. She hit the floor.</i>

484
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,040
What? How did she fall?

485
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,720
Where is she now? Did she miscarry?

486
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,480
All right. I'm coming now.

487
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,280
Ms. Duangporn fell?

488
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,680
Wake Prajak up.

489
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,720
Tell him to get the car ready.
We're going to Bangkok tonight.

490
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,560
Are you going now?
Can't you wait until morning?

491
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,240
I won't be able to sleep.

492
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,880
Go wake Prajak up.
And get yourself ready. You're coming too.

493
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,760
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,920
I leave for one night, and this happens.

495
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Where's Korn off to now?

496
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,520
Probably meeting Mr. Bancha.

497
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,520
What could they have
to talk about so much?

498
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,760
I don't know. How would I know?

499
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,240
Hey.

500
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,880
Maybe he's using work as a cover
to sneak off with some new girl.

501
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,360
That amateur? New girl? Please.

502
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,200
Don't get too confident.

503
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,920
You've stolen gold from him twice already.
Isn't he getting suspicious?

504
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,280
Not at all.

505
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,520
In fact, I took more.

506
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,360
He's really that stupid?

507
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,320
He's not stupid. He's just careless.

508
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,280
Rich people are like that.

509
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,280
Do you want me to tail him?
See if he's actually working?

510
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
I've got a strange feeling.

511
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,040
It looks like he's going with a girl.

512
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,720
Do whatever you want.
Just don't get caught.

513
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,000
I'm going to get ready to sing.

514
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,880
You don't deserve to be a father.

515
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,120
I was stressed about the shop.

516
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,360
I was afraid to fail.
I didn't want to lose to my brothers.

517
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,760
Since when have you ever
beaten them at anything?

518
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,280
You couldn't beat them at studying.

519
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,480
Loyalty? You failed them all.

520
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,680
Wait, there's one thing you excel at.

521
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,120
Being promiscuous.

522
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,840
- No one beats you there.
- Enough.

523
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,120
Don't you think I already feel horrible?

524
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,000
Duangporn, how are you?

525
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,080
Is the baby okay?

526
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,520
I was lucky enough
that I didn't die with the baby.

527
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,440
He threw me to the ground.

528
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
Rak!

529
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,000
How could you be so violent?

530
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
I was drunk.

531
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,920
Just drunk?

532
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,520
Be man enough to own up to it.

533
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
What did you do, Rak?

534
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,120
What did you do?!

535
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,960
He brought a bar girl into our bed.

536
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,000
Haven't you learned your lesson?

537
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
Didn't past mistakes

538
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,920
teach you anything?

539
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,720
I can't clean up after you
for the rest of my life, Rak!

540
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,480
I was stressed about the shop,
so I went to drink.

541
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,680
That's all you've got?

542
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,080
What does drinking even solve?

543
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,360
You're a fool.

544
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,240
No wonder your dad left you nothing!

545
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,720
Stop dredging that up, Mom.
I'm sick of hearing it.

546
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,680
Yeah, I screwed up. That was my fault.

547
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,240
I cheated. My baby's gone.

548
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,560
I can't undo it.
What more do you want from me?

549
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,720
I want a divorce.

550
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,240
Madam…

551
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,200
What's the special occasion?

552
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,560
The occasion is just because I wanted to.

553
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,200
Caught red-handed.
It was you stabbing me in the back!

554
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,840
Happy birthday.

555
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,880
<i>I remember all of your birthdays,</i>

556
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,440
especially your mother's.
I remember, so I can curse her.

557
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,840
I hope you all rot in Hell

558
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,760
<i>for what you did to me</i>

559
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,280
and my family.

560
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,800
<i>Fight fire with fire. He hurt me badly.</i>
<i>So what kind of bomb should we use?</i>

561
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,960
<i>Let's do it at noon today.</i>

562
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,280
Police are now searching
for the explosive.

563
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,400
Please come out now.

564
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,480
