CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

3
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,720
WELCOME TO CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

4
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,040
Thank you, sir,

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,720
for honoring us by attending
the opening of our humble hotel.

6
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,480
What a grand event you've put together!

7
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,760
Thank you.

8
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,000
And where is your son?
We haven't seen him yet.

9
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,240
I bet

10
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,680
Mom's already picked out girls for us.

11
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,120
So boring.

12
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,320
Isn't it a good thing? We don't have
to waste time finding someone ourselves.

13
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,440
As long as she's pretty
and we click, I'm happy.

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Come on, love has to happen naturally.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
You go to an all-boys school, Wee.
When would you even meet a girl?

16
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,120
Young Masters!

17
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,600
Please hurry! Madam's been asking for you!

18
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,400
She's about to lose her temper!

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah, yeah, we're going now, Ngor.

20
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,360
WELCOME TO CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

21
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,360
Madam, they are ready.

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,640
All right then, bring them in.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,760
Young Masters, please come in!

24
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,720
Please.

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Oh, my… all three boys are so handsome!

26
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,240
How are we supposed to choose?

27
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,480
Let me introduce them.
This is the eldest, Rak.

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,680
The second is Rawee,

29
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,360
and the third is Ronnakorn.

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,600
Hello.

31
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,920
Go find yourselves a seat.
Just sit anywhere that's not taken.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Yes, Mom.

33
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Yes, Mom.

34
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,640
This table, please.

35
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,480
This way, please.

36
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
Please sit here.

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,640
This way, please.

38
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,080
If Mom gets mad,
you're taking the blame, Korn!

39
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
This is all so boring.

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,960
If you want to go back in, just go alone.

41
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
No way.

42
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,440
So, where are we going?

43
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,440
If we stay here,
Ngor's going to drag us back in.

44
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,680
Let's go for a drive.

45
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,840
You've learned to drive, haven't you?

46
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,640
I've just started learning…

47
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,080
You won't get better
if you don't hit the main road!

48
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
Let's go!

49
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,920
Let's go!

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait.

51
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
-Search him.
-Young Masters.

52
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
What do you want?

53
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,240
-Why did you take the car key?
-Start the car! Go!

54
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,600
-Go!
-Where are you going?

55
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
Just around here. We'll be right back.

56
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,480
-Young Masters!
-Start the car, bro!

57
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
-Young Masters!
-Go.

58
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,960
-Young Masters!
-Stay quiet!

59
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,000
-Young Masters, please!
-Sorry, Prajak.

60
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,640
Start the car!

61
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,960
-Young Masters!
-Go!

62
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,200
Go!

63
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
Oh?

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Mei, where did your boys go?

65
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,680
I don't know either.

66
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,680
Ma'am! Ma'am!

67
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
What's wrong?

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,200
The young masters drove off in a car!

69
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
Where did they go?

70
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't know, ma'am.

71
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
-Then go find them!
-Yes, ma'am!

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
What's going on?

73
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Floor it, bro!

74
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
No way. What if we crash?

75
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Crash into what? There's not a car around!

76
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,720
Exactly! Don't be such a chicken.

77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
Come on, floor it!

78
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
-Floor it!
-Floor it!

79
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
-Floor it!
-Floor it!

80
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Fine! You want it, you got it!

81
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Hey! Bike! Bike!

82
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
We're in trouble.

83
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,440
Wee.

84
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
Are you all right?

85
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,720
What kind of driving was that?

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,400
Wee just hit an angel.

87
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,600
-I should go help.
-Stop right there.

88
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,600
-Don't you know who she is?
-No.

89
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,360
She's the niece of Auntie Mai the Menace.

90
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,320
Auntie Mai the Menace.

91
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,080
We're screwed!

92
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,840
Why are you still staring at me?

93
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,000
Of course I'm hurt! The bike fell down!

95
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,320
You're bleeding!

96
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,480
Why are you grabbing my arm?

97
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,640
Hold still! I'm trying to help.

98
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
Young Miss!

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,640
Move!

100
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you hurt, miss?

101
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,680
Hey? Prajak!

102
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,360
Bro, let's go!

103
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,680
Young Masters, please come back!

104
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,560
Madam is furious!

105
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
Let's go!

106
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,560
Hope you get well soon.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
-Hurry up.
-All right.

108
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, no… I'm in trouble now.

109
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,560
Hey?

110
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,120
How did you let this happen to my niece?

111
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
I…

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,200
It was my fault, Auntie.

113
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,400
I was teasing Cha-aim
and rode off to hide the bike.

114
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
I wasn't paying attention

115
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
and almost crashed into a car.

116
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,600
How could a bike almost hit a car, miss?

117
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
You were nearly hit by a car, weren't you?

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,720
Neither of us were
really paying attention, Auntie.

119
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,360
Cha-aim, tell me the truth.

120
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Who was driving the car that hit my niece?

121
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,520
I said who?

122
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
It was Madam Mei's son.

123
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,080
Mei's son?

124
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Which one?

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I don't know his name, the handsome one.

126
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,400
Actually, all three of them are handsome.

127
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,440
Hey!

128
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,960
Shut your mouth!
What kind of young lady talks like that?

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,200
Don't talk about a man
in that manner. So disgraceful!

130
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,640
Where are you going, Auntie?

131
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,120
To confront that Mei woman, of course.

132
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
But they're hosting
a hotel launch event right now.

133
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
That's even better.

134
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,400
Let the whole province see
how badly she raised her sons.

135
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,920
She doesn't teach them well.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,640
They don't even have a license,

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,320
and she let them drive
and endanger others!

138
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Let go of me.

139
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
Somneuk!

140
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,720
This is definitely going to blow up, miss.

141
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
Auntie! Auntie!

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
What now?

143
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm coming with you.

144
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,000
Why? You just had a fall.

145
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,440
Stay home and rest.

146
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,400
It's just a scrape. I'm fine now.

147
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,520
And why do you want to come?

148
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,520
To help you point out
the driver, of course.

149
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Let's go, Uncle Nuek!

150
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,160
Why do we even need to do that?

151
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,800
Aren't we going
to say something to help Wee out?

152
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,720
Help or not, he's going to get scolded
anyway. He was the one driving.

153
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
But we went out together.

154
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,600
We can't just let Wee
take the blame alone.

155
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,320
You're Dad's favorite. I'm Mom's favorite.

156
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,360
Even if we confess,
nothing will happen to us.

157
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,120
Nothing's going to change.

158
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,120
Might as well let Wee take it.

159
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,880
He's used to Mom yelling at him by now.

160
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,040
Why didn't you just say no?

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,760
Out of the three of you,
you're the only one who can drive.

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,520
If you'd just said you wouldn't do it,
none of this would've happened!

163
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,400
If it weren't for the hotel event,
I'd have given you a good whipping!

164
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,200
You have no license
and barely know how to drive!

165
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,400
What if someone
had gotten hurt or killed, huh?

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,920
Come here!

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,160
Mom, that hurts!

168
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,240
Was the girl hurt badly?

169
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,680
Well…

170
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,680
Just a scraped arm
and a little blood, Dad.

171
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,920
We're lucky
she didn't report it to the police.

172
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,720
Do you know who she is?

173
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,960
If I know the family,
we can go offer a proper apology.

174
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,000
Your father's asking you. Answer him!

175
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,920
Rak said…

176
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,360
she's Madam Pissamai's niece.

177
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,080
Excuse me, sir,
the hotel is not yet open for business.

178
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,320
Do you even have an invitation?

179
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
No.

180
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,120
Then you can't come in.

181
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,280
Hey! Can't you understand plain speech?

182
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
No invitation, no entry!

183
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,160
I need to see Mr. Jiw and Madam Mei.

184
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,560
You didn't even make an appointment.

185
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,000
You think you can just walk in
and demand to see my bosses?

186
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,040
-What?
-What's going on here?

187
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,440
You're just in time!

188
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,360
He's causing trouble.
Please escort him out!

189
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,960
Got it.

190
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,480
I mean no harm.

191
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
My name is Chen.

192
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,040
I've come to see Mr. Jiw and Madam Mei.

193
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,320
And who are you exactly?

194
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Why should they leave their guests
to come see someone like you?

195
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm Mr. Jiw's son.

196
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
You're always dragging me into trouble!

197
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,320
Of all the people you could hit,
you just had to hit her niece!

198
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,600
Ouch! Mom! That hurts!

199
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,600
That's enough.

200
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,280
Hitting him won't fix anything.

201
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,160
He hurt her niece.

202
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,640
She's not going to let this go easily.
She'll come after us for sure.

203
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,680
Let's not panic before we know the facts.

204
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Ma'am! Something big just happened!

205
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
Is it Pissamai?

206
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,360
No, ma'am.

207
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,480
There's a young man here
asking to see you and Master.

208
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
Then kick him out!

209
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
If he refuses, call the police!
Why are you scared?

210
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
He said his name is Chen…

211
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,520
and he claimed to be Master's son.

212
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,640
What nonsense!

213
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
He's obviously after money!

214
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,840
I'm his only wife.

215
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,880
There's no way he's his child!

216
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,240
Where is he? Take me to him.

217
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,120
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,240
Mom.

219
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,720
Dad.

220
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
Do you know him?

221
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,560
-Dad.
-We'll talk later.

222
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,240
That's strange. Something's definitely up.

223
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,320
Hey.

224
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,360
What's going on?

225
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,200
Why do Mom and Dad look so upset?

226
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
And where are they rushing off to?

227
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,280
Some guy showed up
claiming to be Dad's son.

228
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,600
Who are you?

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
Dad.

230
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
Who sent you
to stir up trouble at my hotel?

231
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
No one.

232
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,440
I came to ask if I could
live here with Dad.

233
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,680
Get out of my hotel. Now.

234
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,480
I have nowhere else to go.

235
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,440
Shameless! I told you to leave,
and you're still here?

236
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,080
Call the police and have him dragged out!

237
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Mei…

238
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,560
Chen really is my son.

239
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,720
-Mom.
-Ma'am.

240
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,960
Mei.

241
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
Ma'am.

242
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,760
Madam Mei!

243
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,680
Madam Mei!

244
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,440
Auntie Mai the Menace?

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,280
Dear, take him away.

246
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,320
We'll talk later.

247
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,160
Go do whatever you have to do.

248
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,880
Your son made a huge mistake,

250
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
and you stand there
pretending like nothing happened?

251
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm busy.

252
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,560
Why? So picking up
the phone and apologizing

253
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,280
is too much effort now?

254
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,720
-Good day, Auntie.
-Good day, Auntie.

255
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,440
I told you to wait in the car.

256
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
Are you hurt?

257
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
Just a scratch, ma'am.

258
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,840
All this fuss

259
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,120
over a little scratch?

260
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,520
Hey.

261
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,120
Watch your tone.
Be thankful she only got a scratch.

262
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
She could've hit her head
and ended up in a coma!

263
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
If that had happened,

264
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,000
your sons

265
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
would be in jail right now!

266
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,640
Whether my niece is seriously hurt or not

267
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,760
doesn't change the fact
that your son broke the law.

268
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,880
He drove without a license.

269
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,840
Which one of you was driving?

270
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,440
Well…

271
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,120
It was me, ma'am.

272
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,760
Do you have a license?

273
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
Obviously not.

274
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
You're his mother.
Why didn't you stop him?

275
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
You're encouraging this kind of behavior?

276
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,840
No wonder your son turned out like
a child with no proper upbringing.

277
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,200
You should be saying that to your niece.

278
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,120
My sons have both a mother and a father.

279
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,200
You heartless woman!

280
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,040
How dare you bring up
her family issues like that?

281
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,680
You…

282
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm going to the police!

283
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
I'm truly sorry, Auntie.

284
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,080
I promise

285
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,240
I'll never drive on public roads again.

286
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,640
Please forgive us, Auntie.

287
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,160
We're truly sorry she got hurt.
It won't happen again.

288
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,240
It was partly my fault too, Auntie.

289
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,800
That's enough.

290
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm not a cruel woman.

291
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,800
I never wanted to ruin your futures.

292
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,880
But don't ever let this happen again.

293
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

294
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,240
Get up.

295
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
Get up already!

296
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,800
So,

297
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,720
if there's nothing else, let's go, Auntie.

298
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,760
Don't leave just yet.

299
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Why don't you stay for the banquet?

300
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,720
You already came all this way
to pick a fight.

301
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,320
Or are you just bitter
you weren't invited?

302
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,880
All the important people in town are here.

303
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,520
Even if I had been invited,
I wouldn't have come!

304
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,560
-Let's just go, Auntie.
-Even if the tables are full,

305
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,600
I could have one

306
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,000
set up right in front
of the hotel just for you.

307
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,640
It might be hot,

308
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
but you've worked
in the sun with the horses.

309
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm sure you can handle the heat, right?

310
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,440
Mei, you foul-mouthed market hag!

311
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,120
You filthy toad, playing royalty!

312
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,240
-Mom!
-Auntie!

313
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
Don't stop me.

314
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,120
-You arrogant wench!
-Uncle Neuk, help.

315
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,520
-Auntie!
-Remember where you came from!

316
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Let go of me!

317
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,040
Useless. Why did you kneel to her?

318
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,160
-Hey…
-Watch your head, Auntie.

319
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
If you hadn't said it yourself,
I wouldn't have believed it.

320
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
I know, right?

321
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,080
-I'm shocked.
-Yes.

322
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
He announced…

323
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,120
Excuse me.

324
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,280
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

325
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,640
There's nothing to worry about.

326
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,840
Madam Pissamai and I

327
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,000
have cleared everything up.

328
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,440
My apologies for the interruption.
Please, enjoy your meal.

329
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,560
Go ahead, please.

330
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,600
This looks delicious.

331
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,040
Please have some more.

332
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,000
PISSAMAI FARM

333
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,480
Your arm's better already?
Should you be riding like that?

334
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,440
It's just a scratch. Falling off a horse
hurts way more than that.

335
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,480
You tough girl.

336
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,760
Just thinking about

337
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,600
that Mei woman today
still makes my blood boil.

338
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,120
Her sons were clearly in the wrong,

339
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,880
yet she couldn't even say
one word to apologize!

340
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,520
Didn't all three of her sons

341
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,360
kneel down to apologize
right in front of you?

342
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Anyway, her sons are
surprisingly decent, unlike their mother.

343
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,160
She's…

344
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,280
What are you smiling at?

345
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,800
Hey.

346
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,880
Don't get involved with any of them.

347
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,280
Just look at their faces.

348
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,720
You can't trust any of them,
all grinning like troublemakers.

349
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,200
How would I even run
into them again, Auntie?

350
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,440
Good. Let's keep it that way.

351
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,960
Stay away from them.

352
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,240
Best if they never set foot
in our lives again.

353
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes, Auntie.

354
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Ma'am!

355
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Ma'am.

356
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,680
What is it?

357
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,880
Have you heard the latest news
about Madam Mei's family?

358
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,240
What now? Starting another new business?

359
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,880
Probably wants to flaunt her wealth again.

360
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,880
I can't blame her.
She used to have nothing.

361
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,520
-No, ma'am.
-Oh?

362
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
Master Jiw secretly has
a son with another woman.

363
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,200
Oh.

364
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,320
Mei…

365
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,680
What exactly happened?

366
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,680
I had already broken up with Chen's mother
before I moved to Thailand.

367
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,640
I didn't know
she was pregnant until later.

368
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,560
And you're sure he's yours?

369
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm sure he's my son.

370
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,960
I've been supporting him.

371
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,600
And hiding it from me all this time?

372
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,360
I didn't want to hurt you.

373
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,680
I could suffer alone.

374
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,480
This was my mistake,
one I have to take responsibility for.

375
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,800
And how far does this responsibility go?

376
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Until death?

377
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,160
I had planned to stop

378
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,440
once he grew up and had a job.

379
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,760
That'd be all.

380
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,440
It would've stayed a secret,
buried with me.

381
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,720
I never imagined

382
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
he'd move to Thailand to be with me.

383
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,200
He probably found out how rich you are

384
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,600
and came to claim his right

385
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,440
and his share.

386
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,280
Chen never knew anything about my wealth.

387
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,400
I never told him.

388
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,720
I'll try to believe that.

389
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,640
But in my life,

390
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
I have only three sons.

391
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,200
And I will never accept
another person as family.

392
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,080
Give him some money and send him away.

393
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,760
If Mom doesn't agree,
Dad won't dare go against her.

394
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,000
Exactly.

395
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
But I do feel bad for him.

396
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,200
He came all the way to Thailand.

397
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,080
There has to be a better solution
than simply kicking him out

398
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,000
He is still Dad's son, after all.

399
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,760
My goodness.

400
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,840
Can I come in?

401
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,960
Come in.

402
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,560
I'd like to ask
if I can become your son too.

403
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
Get up.

404
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,560
There's no need to bow to me.

405
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,320
My mother kicked me out.

406
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,400
Her new husband hates me.

407
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,000
I truly have nowhere to go.

408
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,960
Mom, let him stay.

409
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,800
I feel bad for him.

410
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,880
He's about our age.

411
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
He has no home. Where else can he go?

412
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,160
Please let him stay, Mom.

413
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
At least Dad won't have
to feel so guilty anymore.

414
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,680
I have no opinion.

415
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,120
I'll go with whatever
you're most comfortable with.

416
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,800
Fine.

417
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,280
He can stay.

418
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,160
But I must have sole authority…

419
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,320
when it comes to raising him.

420
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,800
That's more than generous already.

421
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,720
Go get some tea and hot water!

422
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,120
-Yes, Dad.
-No need.

423
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,040
No need.
Don't bother with formalities for me.

424
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,240
Everyone out. I'm tired.

425
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,720
I want to rest.

426
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,680
Mom.

427
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,160
Can I ask for something?

428
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,640
You'd better address me as Madam.

429
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
Yes, Madam.

430
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,440
What do you want?

431
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,560
I want to continue my studies.

432
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,040
Please have mercy and help me
continue my education, Madam.

433
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,520
I'll think about it.

434
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,880
Get up.

435
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,560
I'll introduce you properly.

436
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,040
This is Rak, this is Rawee,
and that's Korn.

437
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,120
Hey, how old are you?

438
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
Chen is two years older than Rak.

439
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,960
So he's your elder brother.

440
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,000
Big Brother Chen.

441
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,880
Stick together, okay?

442
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,240
You're brothers after all.

443
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,400
Yes, Dad.

444
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,800
This one's so pretty!

445
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,719
Yes.

446
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,040
KLONG SIP SONG HOK WA MARKET

447
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,600
They're so handsome!

448
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,199
Hey, bro.

449
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,120
Bro.

450
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320
Wanna go have some fun?

451
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,240
Mr. Rak!

452
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,080
Where are you going?

453
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,800
You go check on those two.
I don't know where they've gone.

454
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,000
What?

455
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,000
They're so good at dodging me.

456
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
You pick one first, miss.
I want to take a quick look at something.

457
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,640
Go ahead. I'll be right here.

458
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,200
I'll be right back.

459
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,720
Wow.

460
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Your shop's full of beautiful clothes…

461
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,120
though not as beautiful
as the one selling them.

462
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,040
Especially this one.

463
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,720
It's the most beautiful of all.

464
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,520
Korn, I'll be right back.

465
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Thank you.

466
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,800
Oh, it's you!

467
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,800
Are you out here alone?

468
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm with my maid.

469
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,880
And you?

470
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,440
With my brothers.

471
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,120
I got bored of the market,
so I came out for a run.

472
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,160
Oh, I see.

473
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,480
Mind if I walk with you?

474
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,880
It's not like I own this place.

475
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,320
You're out here shopping
and didn't invite me?

476
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Chan!

477
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,640
Are you off duty today?

478
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,640
Madam asked me
to follow the young masters.

479
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,600
I see.

480
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,440
Tub!

481
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,880
Young Miss is gone.

482
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,640
Why didn't you keep an eye on her?

483
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,880
Huh?

484
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,080
I go to a boarding school in Bangkok too.

485
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,560
I usually come home on weekends.

486
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,360
It's strange we've never run
into each other before.

487
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,760
I don't come back much.

488
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,320
Auntie's always busy.

489
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,880
Sometimes, she visits me in Bangkok.
I have to be with her while she’s there.

490
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,200
Ah, that explains it.

491
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Hey, check it out. Cute girl alert!

492
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,280
She's cute.

493
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,320
She's mine!

494
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,520
Let's go back.

495
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,200
Wait. Where are you going, sweetheart?

496
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,360
Why? You don't like us?

497
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,680
Stay and have a drink with us.

498
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,160
What do you guys want?

499
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,000
Shut up, punk!

500
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,960
No one's talking to you.
Mind your own business!

501
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,360
Hey.

502
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,720
Do you even know who my aunt is?

503
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,600
If anything happens to us,
you'll never survive in this province.

504
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,640
Oh, a big shot's niece!

505
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm shaking in my boots!

506
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,640
All right, all right. I won't bother you.

507
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,400
Just give us some cash
for snacks and booze.

508
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,560
You could've just said so.

509
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,680
-I think I have some--
-Hey.

510
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,200
Don't give them anything!

511
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,520
They're just a bunch of drunken,
drugged-up parasites with no education.

512
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,640
Useless!

513
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,120
You got a lot to say, huh?

514
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,640
Let's go.

515
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,840
-Let's go.
-Rawee!

516
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,720
I'm sorry.

517
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,320
Bro! Bro!

518
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
We've got to help
Wee and Ranee now! Hurry!

519
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,640
Hey?

520
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,920
Miss Ranee?

521
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,680
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

522
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,200
Stop right there!

523
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,800
You're not getting away, pretty boy.

524
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,680
Get back!

525
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,720
Hey! What the hell
did you do to my brother?

526
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Stop! I said stop!

527
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,520
Stop hurting him.

528
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,320
I said stop! Stop now!

529
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,120
-Tub!
-Let's get you home, miss.

530
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,840
No, go help them!

531
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's go. This doesn't concern us.

532
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,880
I'm not leaving!

533
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,760
You have to help them.

534
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,560
Please, Tub!

535
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,000
Tub!

536
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,360
Miss!

537
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
Did you get hurt?

538
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,000
Are you all right?

539
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,000
Young Masters!

540
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,280
You'll be staying here for now.

541
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,520
You just showed up without any warning.

542
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,680
You'll have to rough it a bit.

543
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,400
I'll be fine, Madam.

544
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,240
I've slept on sidewalks before.

545
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,920
Hang in there.
We'll find something better later.

546
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,440
My job's done. I'm leaving.

547
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,800
Madam.

548
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,240
About school…

549
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,280
You just got here. What makes you think
you can get everything right away?

550
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,320
I was just afraid you might forget, Madam.

551
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,040
You can read and write already?

552
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,320
What school would even take you?

553
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,160
I'll hire a local tutor first.

554
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,400
Once you're ready, we'll talk.

555
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,120
I won't let people laugh at us.

556
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,960
That sounds reasonable.

557
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Ma'am! Ma'am!

558
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,600
Something terrible has happened!

559
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,040
I told you, didn't I?
Stay away from those boys.

560
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,880
They're nothing but trouble.

561
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,440
It was just a coincidence.

562
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,200
And you two are useless!

563
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,200
What if something had happened to her?
Who would take responsibility?

564
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,760
I'm fine now, Auntie.

565
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,040
But I think Madam Mei's sons
were badly hurt.

566
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,680
Let them be!

567
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,360
Why do you even care?

568
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,240
Don't waste your sympathy on them.

569
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,680
If you ever see them again,
run the other way.

570
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,480
Boys like that don't die easily.

571
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,880
Got it?

572
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,480
Yes, Auntie.

573
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,240
You two as well. Look out for her.

574
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,920
You know how much
I hate that family. Understand?

575
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,440
Come on, Mei.

576
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,440
Fighting's just what boys do.

577
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,760
At least they're okay.
That's what matters.

578
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,760
It's your fault. Because of you,

579
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840
your brothers got hurt too.

580
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,320
She's a girl, Mom.
How could I not help her?

581
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,800
She had a whole crew of maids
and bodyguards swarming her!

582
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,120
They could protect her just fine.

583
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,320
You can play the gentleman with anyone,

584
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,200
except Pissamai's niece.

585
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,720
So you would've wanted me to just
stand there and watch her get jumped?

586
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,160
I couldn't do that, Mom.

587
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,600
Always arguing!

588
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
You always have something to say!

589
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,560
Why are you so stubborn?

590
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,120
Since you were little,
you've never listened to me!

591
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Why can't you be more like Rak and Korn?

592
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,480
All you ever do

593
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,600
is give me headaches!

594
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,680
But Mom, I…

595
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,120
Huh?

596
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,960
Go now.

597
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,880
Get out of my sight.

598
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,320
What is this, the end of the world?

599
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,440
All right, boys, go take a shower

600
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,720
and get ready for school tomorrow.

601
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,600
Hey.

602
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,280
Let's go jump in the canal!

603
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,880
Let's go.

604
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,040
-Last one gets thrown in the canal!
-See that?

605
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,080
Do they look sorry to you?

606
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,360
Come on. You should be glad

607
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,840
they love one another and stick together.

608
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,880
They help each other in times of danger.

609
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,640
Siblings are like arms and legs.

610
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,440
That love only applies

611
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,960
to the three of them.

612
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,040
Whoa.

613
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,880
That hurt, didn't it?
Mom really didn't hold back.

614
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,360
I'm used to it.

615
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,960
You shouldn't have argued with her.

616
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,120
You know how she feels
about Madam Pissamai.

617
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,680
Yeah, you should've kept quiet.

618
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,920
Let her yell.
She'll tire herself out eventually.

619
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,320
All right.

620
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,800
Next time I'll bite my tongue.

621
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,200
You only stepped in

622
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,520
to impress her, didn't you?

623
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,840
You like her, don't you?

624
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,560
You would have done the same too.

625
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,480
We couldn't let a little girl
get jumped by a bunch of thugs.

626
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,440
-Let's jump in the water.
-Let's go.

627
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,920
Wee, come on.

628
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,160
Wee, come on.

629
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,720
Yeah!

630
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,640
That hurts.

631
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,000
Hey! Chen! Come join us!

632
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,920
Can you swim?

633
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah.

634
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,880
Then jump in already! Let's race!

635
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,840
Jump! Jump! Jump!

636
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,440
Jump!

637
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,360
Jump!

638
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,840
Jump!

639
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,400
Jump!

640
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,280
-Hey!
-Ouch, Auntie!

641
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,920
Don't you have work to do?

642
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,000
I'm watching over
the young masters, of course!

643
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,360
Careful! You'll end up
with styes from all that ogling.

644
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,760
You're such a shameless little flirt.
Not ladylike at all!

645
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,760
Honestly though,
Mr. Chen's pretty handsome too.

646
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,080
But he's no match for my Mr. Rak.

647
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,800
That's right.

648
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,320
I mean,
that's not the right thing to do now!

649
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,040
Come help me in the kitchen now.

650
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,400
Come!

651
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,000
Come on, hurry up!

652
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,680
-Bro!
-Korn!

653
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,280
-Ah!
-Wait up.

654
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,320
Hey!

655
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,840
Be careful.

656
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,280
Bro!

657
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,120
Hurry up!

658
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,920
Chen! Chen!

659
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,640
Help…

660
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,440
<i>Chen!</i>

661
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,680
I could apologize a hundred times,

662
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,960
and it still wouldn't ease your mind.

663
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,320
That's right.

664
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,040
Just don't let me catch you

665
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,400
loving him

666
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,000
more than our boys.

667
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,800
How could I possibly love
a son I never raised

668
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,160
more than the ones
I raised with my own hands?

669
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,440
That had better be true.

670
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,280
Ma'am! Ma'am!

671
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,240
-Ma'am!
-What is it?

672
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,440
Ma'am!

673
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,240
Mr. Rawee's drowning!

674
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,080
Don't tense up. Just relax.

675
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,280
You really know what you're doing, Chen?

676
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,080
Are you okay? One more.

677
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,840
Not so hard, please!

678
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,480
How could you drown?
You grew up next to this canal!

679
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,920
He had a cramp, Mom.

680
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,000
He's been overdoing it today.
Driving, fighting,

681
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,880
and swimming. Guess it caught up with him.

682
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,120
Hey.

683
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,160
You have to know your limits.

684
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,440
You can't just do things for fun.

685
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,480
What if you had died?

686
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,920
It's lucky Chen was there to help.

687
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,280
Otherwise, he'd already be
with Grandpa and Grandma in Heaven.

688
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,800
Even without him,
you could've saved him yourselves.

689
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,520
Don't act like we owe him anything.

690
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,560
Are you feeling better now?

691
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,840
Yes, Mom.

692
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,680
All right. Move it.

693
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Go.

694
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,320
Let's go.

695
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,160
Be careful.

696
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,920
Thank you.

697
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,000
Just be patient.

698
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,320
One day, Mei will see the good in you.

699
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,160
Yes, Dad.

700
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,960
Rawee…

701
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,880
<i>It's okay to joke around, miss.</i>

702
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,240
<i>Just don't fall for him.</i>

703
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,240
Madam will never allow it.

704
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,800
<i>Will we see each other again?</i>

705
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,240
<i>I wish we had more time together.</i>

706
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,640
Want to get some experience?
I'll take you.

707
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,240
<i>All three of you.</i>

708
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,720
<i>I'm the eldest brother.</i>
<i>I'll cover everything.</i>

709
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,600
<i>I don't know what's going on, Dad.</i>

710
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,880
<i>It's swollen and red or something.</i>

711
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,720
Oh, no… You went to a brothel, didn't you?

712
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,480
Which one of your friends
dragged you into this mess?

713
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,800
Tell me!

714
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,960
