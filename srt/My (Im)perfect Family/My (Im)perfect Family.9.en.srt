00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,760
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Hello, Mr. Chen.

2
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>Welcome back to Charoenrung Hotel.</i>

3
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
<i>Settle everything</i>
<i>while there's still time.</i>

4
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,520
The real manager of Charoenrung Hotel

5
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,320
<i>is about to take charge.</i>

6
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,160
He won't come back
unless we let him marry Ranee.

7
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,919
<i>I'll stop sending him money.</i>

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,520
<i>Let's see how long he lasts.</i>

9
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
<i>That man looks so familiar.</i>

10
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
I feel like I've seen him before.

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,320
Your son's wedding

12
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,680
will be the talk of the town.

13
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,760
Has the banquet already started?

14
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,520
They've begun serving the food, ma'am.

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,280
-Open the door for me.
-Yes, ma'am.

16
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
Wait, please.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,320
Your name isn't on the guest list.

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
So what?

19
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,680
If your name's not on the list,
you can't go in.

20
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,480
But I'm the hotel manager's wife.

21
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,680
But Madam Mei specifically ordered that

22
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,200
only those on the guest list
are allowed inside the banquet.

23
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,200
I really can't go against her order.

24
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm going in to see Mr. Chen.
Open the door.

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
The manager isn't at the banquet, ma'am.

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,280
She ordered them
to keep me out of the event.

27
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
That woman has gone too far.

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
If you were coming,
you should've called me first.

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Who would've thought you'd be banned
from the wedding banquet?

30
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,720
What a humiliation in front of the staff!

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,600
She wants war.

32
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,120
Then let's just go.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Better people think we didn't come at all
than know we were turned away.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
Wait.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,320
Since we're already here,
let's stick around for the show.

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Bua loy in ginger syrup, sir.

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
-Please.
-All right.

38
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,960
I was about to say "serves them right."

39
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,000
Please.

40
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,280
Eat more.

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
Do you want some?

42
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,360
If it's not coming, it's all right.

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Just finish it.

44
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,840
DUANGPORN - RAK

45
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,480
Hey. Hey!

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,120
Can you bring a bowl of buy loy
to the bride and groom's table?

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
I don't think anyone's served them yet.

48
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,280
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
Anyway,

50
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
just give me a bowl here.

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,400
There are too many VIPs at the table.
I can't really eat there.

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
All right.

53
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,600
may I invite the bride and groom
to thank our honored guests

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,960
on the stage, please?

56
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,760
Hey, wait.

57
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
Didn't you hear what I just said?

58
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,920
Hey?!

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
Dad, Mom.

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,680
I think I sprained my ankle.

61
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,200
Miss,

62
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
if you ever run short on anything,

63
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,160
just send Cha-aim over to get it.

64
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
And as for Mr. Rawee,

65
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,880
tell him

66
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,080
he doesn't need to worry
about Madam anymore.

67
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,040
She's not going to object now.

68
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,680
Thank you, Grandma.

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160
Thank you, Auntie.

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,520
And stop thinking
about going to work in Bangkok.

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,680
If you ever need money, just tell me.

72
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm not in a rush.

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,080
Pay me back whenever you can.
I won't even charge interest.

74
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,720
Yes, Auntie.

75
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,840
And don't you dare tell Rawee

76
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,680
how much I'm asking for the dowry
or what the terms are, understand?

77
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,960
This feels like I'm being used as a tool.

78
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,000
So, are you getting married or not?

79
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
Madam!

80
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,400
There's been an explosion
at Charoenrung Hotel!

81
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
Rawee.

82
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,800
-Please watch your step.
-Right this way, everyone.

83
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,720
This way, please.

84
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,840
This way, please.

85
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,920
Please walk carefully.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
Take your time.

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,720
-Mind the steps.
-Don't be alarmed.

88
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
-This way, please.
-It's just a blackout.

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,120
Right this way, please.

90
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,360
-This way, please.
-It's all ruined.

91
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,520
Don't overthink it. It was unavoidable.

92
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,280
Are you sure it wasn't sabotage?

93
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
And where's the backup power?

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
This way, please.

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,160
Madam, we've identified
the cause of the outage.

96
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,200
The transformer exploded.

97
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Of all days, it had to explode today?

98
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
Have you called the electricity authority?

99
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,240
Yes, sir. Already done.

100
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,560
It's probably going to take a while.
We should consider ending the event now.

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,920
Let's go see the guests out and apologize.

102
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Rak, Duangporn.

103
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,400
-Yes?
-Yes, Mom?

104
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,200
Come with me to see the guests off.
Apologize to everyone.

105
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,760
-Be careful.
-Take it slow, be careful.

106
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go.

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
We sincerely apologize.

108
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,440
The transformer explosion
was completely unforeseen.

109
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,840
We're terribly sorry
for the shock and panic it caused.

110
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,240
It's all right.
No one wanted this to happen.

111
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,880
These are discount vouchers
for our hotel's restaurant.

112
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Please come use them anytime.

113
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,720
It's a token of apology from our family.

114
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
Once again, we apologize.

115
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
All right, here it is.

116
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,800
Looks like someone's already taken over.
Guess we don't need to do anything.

117
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,640
At this point, I don't even know
who the bride and groom are anymore.

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,120
The guests must be completely confused.

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
I can't help
but be suspicious of Chen, Dad.

120
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,360
You two go see the guests off.

121
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,520
It's your event.
If you don't do anything, it'll look bad.

122
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,400
Apologize to everyone.

123
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,520
Yes.

124
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,480
Yes, Dad.

125
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,440
Let's go.

126
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
-We're very sorry.
-Sorry

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
for all the disruption today.

128
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

129
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,840
Here's your pay.

130
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Thank you.

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,800
If that's all, I'll head out now.

132
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,600
All right, see you around.

133
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
Wait.

134
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,040
Where were you before the power went out?

135
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,600
In the kitchen, ma'am.

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,800
Did you notice anything strange?

137
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
No, nothing really.

138
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,800
Which transformer exploded?

139
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
Over that way, ma'am.

140
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,280
Rawee?

141
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,040
Who's in there?

142
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
I asked who's there.

143
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Come out.

144
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,960
I said come out!

145
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh?

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,040
Oh, Mom?

147
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Korn, what were you doing in this room?

148
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
I just came to use the restroom.

149
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,600
And what about you?

150
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
Let's go, Mom.
What are you doing here in the dark?

151
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Let's go.

152
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,960
You scared the hell out of me, Tub.
I thought I got caught.

153
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
So, does your aunt know we're back?

154
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,080
Are you sure no one saw you?

155
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,160
Korn did.

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,720
Are you sure he won't tell your mom?

157
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,480
Tell her what? He actually helped me.

158
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,960
If he hadn't stepped in,
my mom would've caught me for sure.

159
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,160
Let's go, Miss.

160
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,640
Traffic is clear now. We can exit easily.

161
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,600
Everything's ruined.

162
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,720
We were supposed to shine,
and now we're humiliated instead.

163
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,920
It's not that bad.

164
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,040
The guests probably understand.
It was an accident.

165
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,160
More like someone
made it look like an accident.

166
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,440
I feel the same way, Mom. All these years,
the transformer's never exploded before.

167
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
He's right.

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,560
We've been running this place forever.
There was never even a blackout.

169
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,360
And this time, even the backup failed.

170
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,000
And of all times,
it had to happen during my wedding.

171
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
I'm sure

172
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Chen and Hong are behind this.

173
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,560
You need to cut them off,
once and for all.

174
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,280
Take decisive action.

175
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,840
Or are you still going to protect them?

176
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,360
If you want me to accuse someone,
there must be proof.

177
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,440
Where's the evidence
that Chen caused the explosion?

178
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,520
If you can provide solid proof

179
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,400
that Chen sabotaged the transformer,

180
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,600
I will hold him accountable.

181
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,720
Keep defending him.

182
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,120
By now,

183
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,040
he's probably laughing
at our family at the hotel.

184
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,280
Mom, I'm going to bed.

185
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,200
Let's go.

186
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,960
Slowly, please.

187
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,200
It was so satisfying.
I'd have regretted missing this.

188
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,880
Tomorrow, it'll be all over the news,
just like they wanted.

189
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,760
And not just everywhere in the province.

190
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,680
Maybe even all over Bangkok.

191
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,960
Of course.

192
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,320
They told me to invite
politicians and major tycoons,

193
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,600
hoping to boost the image
of their precious son.

194
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,160
And now? Total disaster. Total disgrace.

195
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,560
The hotel's credibility in ruins.

196
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,400
This was nothing but a loss for them.

197
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,520
Let's see how Rawee plans
to recover from this.

198
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,880
Are you still up?

199
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,480
Yes.

200
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,080
Then I'm coming in.

201
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Okay.

202
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,120
You can't sleep?

203
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,840
I feel bad for Mom.

204
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,880
She poured her heart into Rak's wedding.

205
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
And it all collapsed in the end.

206
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,440
People who already didn't like her
are now piling on even more.

207
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,080
That's just how it is.

208
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,840
Even if everything had gone smoothly,

209
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,200
they'd still find fault
and say she was flaunting her wealth.

210
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,080
Still, it's better than
being laughed at behind our backs.

211
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
This incident really damaged
the hotel's credibility.

212
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,480
Why didn't the backup system work?

213
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,119
I don't even want to think
we were sabotaged.

214
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,839
The one who stands to lose power

215
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,280
if you take over the hotel,
that's your prime suspect.

216
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,280
I hope that's not the case.

217
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,319
We're family, after all.

218
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
Anyway,

219
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm meeting Korn tomorrow.
Do you want to come?

220
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
I'd better not.
You two brothers should talk alone.

221
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,640
Okay. Then, good night.

222
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Good night.

223
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
Korn.

224
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Have you been waiting long?

225
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Not really.

226
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,520
Thanks a lot for helping me out.

227
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
What's wrong with you?
Why are you acting so weird?

228
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,920
You're being quiet and stiff.

229
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
One hot coffee, please.

230
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,040
All right.

231
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,040
Mom!

232
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,520
You betrayed me?

233
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,000
Don't be mad at your brother.

234
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
Be mad at me.

235
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,200
I need to ask something.

236
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,200
Rawee's back, isn't he?

237
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,640
Don't even think about lying to me.

238
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,640
Why wouldn't I remember my son?

239
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,560
I can tell my sons apart

240
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,360
just by their earlobes.

241
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,040
Tell me everything you know.

242
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,880
Don't make me angrier than I already am,

243
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,160
or both you and Rawee will be in trouble.

244
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm sorry, Mom.

245
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,720
I let you go last night

246
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,040
because we already had enough trouble.

247
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,400
And it wasn't hard to find you
thanks to Korn.

248
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,960
I'm sorry, Brother.

249
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,200
-You know if Mom--
-Never mind.

250
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,720
I was bound to return
sooner or later anyway.

251
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,120
You're determined
to marry that woman, aren't you?

252
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,080
Yes, Mom.

253
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,880
Then,

254
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,880
you must take over
managing the hotel. I'm firing Chen.

255
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,120
If you agree, I'll have your dad

256
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
go ask for Ranee's hand right away.

257
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,440
You know

258
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,840
what you did was wrong, right?

259
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,640
Don't ever use
your parents' love as leverage again.

260
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,560
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,360
But if I hadn't done this,

262
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,160
Ranee and I probably
wouldn't be getting married.

263
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
If the hotel weren't in trouble,

264
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
I would've disowned you already.

265
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,160
You're just lucky
things turned out this way.

266
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,200
Decide when your dad should go propose

267
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,200
before I change my mind.

268
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,120
All right, you can get up now.

269
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,800
Yes, Dad.

270
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,920
Have you arranged
to meet with Ranee's aunt yet?

271
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,680
You can go see her this afternoon, Dad.

272
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,840
Wow,

273
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,280
my bro's moving faster than a rocket.
Do you want to do the ceremony tonight?

274
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,960
That's too much.

275
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,040
I'd better go get ready.

276
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,080
Yes, Dad.

277
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,200
Come on.

278
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
My little bro's getting married!

279
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
Thanks.

280
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm happy for you.

281
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,560
Thanks, Korn.

282
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,320
-What are you doing?
-Hey, you're getting married.

283
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
You must stay in shape

284
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,560
for the wedding night.

285
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,640
Madam,

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,920
are you really not going with them?

287
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
I don't want to step foot in her house.

288
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,440
Master's too kind. Be careful or
that stable-hand madam will take advantage

289
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,960
and twist things in her favor.

290
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,720
Good afternoon.

291
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,400
Good afternoon.

292
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,320
Good afternoon.

293
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,040
Did you spend the night at the hotel?

294
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Of course.

295
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,120
Chen had to oversee everything.

296
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Who would just abandon the event
and go home to sleep?

297
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,800
What a shame.

298
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,640
Such a dedicated manager

299
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,120
is about to be out of a job.

300
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,560
What are you talking about?

301
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880
You stayed at the hotel,
so I guess you haven't heard

302
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,360
that Rawee's back.

303
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,520
When did he come back?

304
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,320
I don't know the exact time.

305
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,360
I just know they're out proposing
to his bride right now.

306
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,680
Once the wedding's done,

307
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,520
he's likely
to be appointed manager right away.

308
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,000
Five or six years is not a short time.

309
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
These two
have remained loyal to each other

310
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,640
despite major obstacles.

311
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,400
It's time

312
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,720
for us to be happy for them
and give them our support.

313
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,960
It's not like
I was against it from the beginning.

314
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,480
I just wanted time to prove things.

315
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
So you're not objecting.

316
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,920
Then I'll arrange for a matchmaker.

317
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,440
There's no need for a matchmaker.

318
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,200
We're all here now.
We can sort everything today.

319
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,920
What we really need
to talk about is the dowry.

320
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,000
Auntie.

321
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
Forget the customs.

322
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,440
What matters is the money. So greedy.

323
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,560
I'm only asking so the two will have
a bit of capital to start with.

324
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,640
Please go ahead.

325
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,480
When did he come back?

326
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,760
I don't know.

327
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Right now, your dad and Madam
are out proposing to Ranee.

328
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,520
So she's swallowing her pride
to let Rawee marry Ranee

329
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,800
just so she can drag me off this chair?

330
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,480
Duangporn said that

331
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,560
right after the wedding, Rawee's going to
take over the manager position from you.

332
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
There's still time.

333
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,400
I don't intend to demand too much, really.

334
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,680
Just what's necessary,

335
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,480
money, gold, and land.

336
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
Three million baht in cash,

337
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,360
gold weighing ten baht,

338
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,880
and a piece of land by the new road.

339
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
Isn't that a bit too much?

340
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,320
Not at all.

341
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,480
My niece is beautiful, wealthy, capable,

342
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,320
and was educated abroad.

343
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,800
A complete package like her
doesn't come by often, you know.

344
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,800
Which piece of land are you referring to?

345
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,720
The one from Kiang that was sold off
to settle her debts with me.

346
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,560
That small plot.

347
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,600
Yes,
but it blocks access to the land I bought.

348
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,080
There's no way out to the main road.

349
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,040
Fine, I'll agree.

350
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,080
But in return, you must agree
to let me buy the land

351
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,720
and the Old Market building
owned by Madam Prakai.

352
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
Isn't that the place
you plan to build the cinema, Dad?

353
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,600
So? What do you say?

354
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
Very well.

355
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
I'll agree, for Master's sake.

356
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,880
Thank you very much.

357
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,480
Then that settles the dowry.
Let's hope there'll be no more surprises.

358
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Let us now proceed

359
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,680
to discuss the details of the wedding.

360
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,200
All right.

361
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
For the wedding ceremony,
I'd like it to be

362
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,320
-Thai--
-Chinese.

363
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,440
-Thai style.
-Chinese style.

364
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,520
Excuse me, but my family's Thai.
Of course we'll do it Thai style.

365
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,640
And my family's Chinese.
We'll do it the Chinese way.

366
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,080
-Thai.
-How about we do both?

367
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,960
Yes, both sides' families
will be happy that way.

368
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,040
That sounds good.

369
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,160
Fine.

370
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,560
But after the wedding,
Ranee must live at my house.

371
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,040
Are you crazy?

372
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,320
What kind of backward custom is that?
A woman is supposed to move out.

373
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,480
Oh?

374
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,480
I only have one niece.
Of course I worry about her.

375
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,240
A daughter-in-law must live in my house.

376
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,400
She'll live with me!

377
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,120
Let's leave it here

378
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,160
for today.

379
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,440
We can go over
the finer details next time.

380
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,200
Each side can go check
for a good date and time.

381
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,080
Once that's settled,
we'll arrange another meeting.

382
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,040
Please read
the wedding compatibility for the couple.

383
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,800
Here are the birthdates and times
of the bride and groom.

384
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,600
I've got the date. Thursday the 18th.

385
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,480
Mine's Thursday the 18th too.

386
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,080
But mine can't change.

387
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,000
It's sacred

388
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,640
and the most auspicious day
to hold a ceremony.

389
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Mine can't change either.

390
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,880
If not that day, the next auspicious date

391
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,880
isn't until next year.
You will have to change yours.

392
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,880
Well, I won't.

393
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm not changing it.

394
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,560
The fortune teller
already scheduled everything,

395
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,680
haircut, gown fitting.

396
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,480
You're the one who'll have to change.

397
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,480
Wait.

398
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,120
Why does a wedding need
so many auspicious steps? Haircut?!

399
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
Why don't we hold
the ceremony on the same day?

400
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
Yes.

401
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,200
The auspicious date is the same,
but the time isn't.

402
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,520
The kids have a point.

403
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Let's all go inside, cool down,
and go over the details calmly.

404
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,240
The beginning is always the hardest.

405
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,920
Please, Madam Pissamai.

406
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,400
Thank you.

407
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,240
Are we really going to get married?

408
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,320
Of course we are.

409
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,720
Let's go.

410
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,360
Hey, Korn.

411
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
Korn, over here!

412
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,480
Move, move.

413
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,760
Man, it's been forever.

414
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,680
You came back and didn't even hit us up.

415
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,520
I was going call you guys
once I arrived in Bangkok.

416
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,200
It's been a long time.
We'll drink until the bar closes.

417
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,080
I've got a hotel room booked already.

418
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,680
-Let's get wasted, guys.
-Let's do it.

419
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,720
Let's go!

420
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,640
<i>I fell for you without even knowing</i>

421
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,160
<i>It slowly seeped into my heart</i>

422
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,040
<i>Day by day, night by night</i>

423
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,760
<i>And before I knew it</i>
<i>You were the only one</i>

424
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,600
<i>That I gave my love to</i>

425
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,800
<i>I don't know when you captured my heart</i>

426
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,000
<i>No one else has ever</i>

427
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,120
<i>Possessed my heart completely</i>

428
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,240
<i>Every corner of it is filled with you</i>

429
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,400
<i>No one else has ever</i>

430
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>Your image…</i>

431
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,000
Hey, you're totally frozen, man.

432
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,640
That's Chomechawee, the star
of this place. You don't know her, right?

433
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,080
<i>You alone live in every beat of my heart</i>

434
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,960
<i>Even a faint melody</i>
<i>Brings thoughts of you…</i>

435
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,640
Is Korn back yet?

436
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,960
Not yet, Mom.

437
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,840
It's so late already,
and he's still not home?

438
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,120
I was busy with your stuff all day.

439
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,440
If I weren't,
I wouldn't have let him drive off alone.

440
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,480
What are you eating this late at night?

441
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,240
Duangporn was hungry, Mom.

442
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
Then why didn't she come out
and get it herself?

443
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,520
It's just a little thing, Mom.

444
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,280
I was getting water anyway,
so I brought something up for her.

445
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Don't spoil her too much,

446
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,600
or she'll get out of hand.

447
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,680
I raised you with so much effort,
and you never treated me like this.

448
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,760
You only pamper your wife.

449
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,520
Well, you don't eat at night, Mom.

450
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,520
Here, take this.

451
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,640
Don't even try.

452
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,280
Did Korn say what time he'd be back?

453
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,320
He said if the party runs late,

454
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,840
he'll just sleep at the hotel
and come back in the morning.

455
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,639
That kid.
He's probably boozing it up with friends.

456
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,159
But I think sleeping
at the hotel is actually safer, Mom.

457
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
He'd better be sleeping,

458
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,880
not causing trouble
and making me clean up after him again.

459
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,440
Don't worry, Mom.
Korn knows how to take care of himself.

460
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,239
When we studied overseas,
he never caused any problems.

461
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,920
And that was without you around.

462
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
You brothers always cover for each other.

463
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,560
Let's hope
you're not just putting up a front.

464
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,440
Let's stop here.

465
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,520
Why?

466
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,640
We don't really know
each other that well yet.

467
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,400
Well, we're getting to know
each other right now, aren't we?

468
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,080
Don't tell me…

469
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,800
you've never done it before?

470
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm saving myself for my future wife.

471
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,880
My angel.

472
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
Come here.

473
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,000
Then let's just sit and talk.

474
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,600
In my life,

475
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,080
I've never met a man like you before.

476
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,680
Guys like me are practically extinct.

477
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,040
Guess we'd better preserve
rare specimens like you.

478
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,440
I believe in soulmates.

479
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,880
Me too.

480
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,080
Everyone has their destined partner.

481
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,440
I believe that.

482
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
It's just a matter of when we'll meet,

483
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,040
this life

484
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,600
or the next.

485
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,200
That's kind of depressing, isn't it?

486
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,880
Who knows how long we'll be lonely

487
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,920
before we meet that person.

488
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,560
All we can do is wait.

489
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,680
But sometimes,

490
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,480
having a secret crush

491
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,000
helps pass the time.

492
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,400
Then can I secretly love you?

493
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,920
I'm tired of waiting aimlessly
for someone who may never come.

494
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,680
Chome?

495
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,160
Are you in the bathroom?

496
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,120
IF YOU WANT ME TO KEEP SECRETLY LOVING
YOU, COME SEE ME AGAIN. CHOMECHAWEE.

497
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,280
<i>If you want me</i>
<i>to keep secretly loving you,</i>

498
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,840
<i>come see me again.</i>

499
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,160
I'll count to three,
then you make the first cut.

500
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
Yes, ma'am.

501
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,880
One, two, three.

502
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Are we done here yet?
I need to prepare things on my end too.

503
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,360
Hold on.

504
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,760
What now?

505
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,240
There are still plenty of things the bride
needs to prepare before she gets married.

506
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,600
What else is there?

507
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,480
Here, I wrote it all down.
You read it yourself.

508
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,760
Thank you.

509
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,600
Why do we have to prepare so much stuff?

510
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,040
We're not even going to use it.

511
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,920
If you want my relatives
to look down on the bride,

512
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,080
then go ahead.

513
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,920
<i>No one else has ever</i>

514
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,240
<i>Possessed my heart completely</i>

515
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,480
<i>Every single corner is filled with you</i>

516
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
<i>I can't see anyone else</i>

517
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,920
<i>Your image</i>

518
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
<i>Floats like a dream, stirring my soul</i>

519
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,360
<i>You alone live in every beat of my heart</i>

520
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
Thank you.

521
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,800
That was awesome.

522
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,960
You're actually really good at guitar.

523
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,080
It was because your singing was beautiful.

524
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
Can you play this one?

525
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,440
Now I understand

526
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,000
why I've always liked playing guitar,

527
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,920
even though
none of my siblings cared for it.

528
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,680
Were you preparing for the day
you'd fall in love with a singer?

529
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,360
Will you marry me?

530
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,040
I mean it.

531
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,120
I work at a nightclub.

532
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,040
I dance and sing to make a living.
Your family would never accept me.

533
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,640
You'd better let me keep
secretly loving you like this.

534
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,880
Where is it?

535
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,280
Here it is.

536
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,000
Wouldn't you regret it

537
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
if I turned out to be
the one you were waiting for?

538
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,320
You might be the one
I was waiting for too.

539
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,440
But isn't it a little too soon?

540
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,880
Then give me your answer next week.

541
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,560
Next week? That's such a long time!

542
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,720
<i>Even if the sun abandons</i>

543
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,400
<i>The horizon</i>

544
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,800
<i>And the night is left without stars</i>

545
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880
<i>Beside the moon…</i>

546
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,480
Today, I went to check out the cinema
in Bangkok for you, Dad.

547
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,080
Did you hire someone to take photos?

548
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,960
I hired someone from Bangkok, Dad.

549
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,800
It's cheaper than bringing someone
from here. I'll pick up the photos later.

550
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,640
You sure look for excuses
to go to Bangkok a lot.

551
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,440
I went there for work, not for fun, Mom.

552
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,440
Let's hope that's true.

553
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,120
Come eat with us, Chen.

554
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,280
I'd rather not, Dad.
It'll only make everyone uncomfortable.

555
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,800
If sharing the table
makes you uncomfortable,

556
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,000
then what's the point of staying
under the same roof? Just move out.

557
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,200
I just don't want anyone
to lose their appetite because of me.

558
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,520
Ngor, serve rice for Chen and Hong.

559
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,760
Yes, sir.

560
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,280
There's barely any space
left at this table.

561
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,160
And we'll be adding Ranee soon too.

562
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,360
We'd better save a seat for my wife too.

563
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,200
Hey, don't go rushing to grab just anyone.

564
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,880
I've already got someone in mind for you.

565
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,720
We'll need a bigger table anyway, Mom.

566
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,720
Duangporn and I are planning
to have five kids.

567
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,520
Mr. Rak.

568
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,840
Can you handle that, Duangporn?

569
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,840
Are you just talk,
or can you really do it, Bro?

570
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,960
How's the hotel?

571
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,320
A lot of clients
are canceling banquet room bookings, Dad.

572
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,880
You'd better fix that fast.

573
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,760
Rawee's wedding is on the 18th.

574
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,520
He'll start working at the hotel
at the beginning of next month.

575
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,520
That won't work yet.

576
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,840
Why not?

577
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,520
I have ongoing work to wrap up.
I'll need a month.

578
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,960
That's not necessary.

579
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,480
Let Chen finish his work, Mom.

580
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,840
After the wedding,
I'll start training with him.

581
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,840
It's good to follow the hotel rules

582
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,240
and submit notice one month in advance.

583
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,720
That way,
no one can gossip behind your back.

584
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,520
Then write your resignation letter today.

585
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,920
Don't think about
dragging this out any longer.

586
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,960
Let's just eat.

587
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,640
The atmosphere's lovely tonight.
It should be great for our appetites.

588
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,080
All right, everyone, let's eat. Eat well,
smile, sleep soundly. That's happiness.

589
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,160
Chanraem, wait for me!

590
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,040
Let's go, everyone.

591
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,120
Let's be happy.

592
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,760
There!

593
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,960
The three people named Young Master.

594
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,360
Stay here.

595
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,840
Do you remember that woman?

596
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,240
Say what I told you.

597
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,880
<i>You're about to give birth?</i>

598
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,440
Stop the car right now!

599
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,840
Why are we stopping?

600
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,200
Chan!

601
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,000
Where are you running off to?

602
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,280
Chan!

603
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,400
That woman hurt you, didn't she?

604
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,760
Didn't she?

605
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,160
I'm scared. I'm so scared, Tub!

606
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,000
There he comes.

607
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,080
Thank you.

608
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,840
TITLE DEED

609
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,320
May your life
be full of happiness and prosperity.

610
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,040
May you love each other

611
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,560
until old age.

612
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,400
May your journey together
be joyful and prosperous.

613
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,960
May you be happy forever.

614
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,400
Sathu.

615
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,680
All done, dear.

616
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,440
This is so heavy, I can barely lift it.

617
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,920
We're not mocking, really.

618
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,840
It's just tradition.

619
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,120
Who asked?

620
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,960
I just wanted to say it.

621
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,960
Auntie.

622
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,400
Cha-aim, go call the bride
to come meet the groom.

623
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,880
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,840
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

625
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,720
Go fetch your bride.

626
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,240
Oh? Yes, Dad.

627
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,840
Excuse me, I'll put the dowry away now.

628
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,120
It's so heavy.

629
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,520
I almost forgot the title deed.

630
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,000
Look. It's heavy, right?

631
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,960
Dear, when will
this ceremony finally be over?

632
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,680
I'm so sick of this place.
I just want to leave.

633
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,160
Be patient. It's almost done.

634
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,080
Rawee sure knows how to pick a wife.

635
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,120
Did you pick the wrong one then?

636
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,520
Of course I didn't. You're stunning.

637
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,640
Your mouth's hanging open.
A fly's about to fly in and lay eggs.

638
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,360
That's exaggerating.

639
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,640
So lovely.

640
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,320
Look at them.

641
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,560
Nice.

642
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
You're gorgeous.

643
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,520
Kiss her!

644
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,880
Kiss her!

645
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,800
Kiss her!

646
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,960
Kiss her!

647
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,800
Kiss her!

648
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,520
So lovely.

649
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,960
The bride should kiss the groom back!

650
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,440
Oh? That's right.

651
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,280
Kiss him!

652
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,080
Kiss him!

653
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,000
Kiss him!

654
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,680
Kiss him!

655
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,280
Nice!

656
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,800
Cha-aim.

657
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,280
Dear, what's left in the ceremony?

658
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,320
The monk's blessing,
the water-pouring ritual,

659
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,320
and then the couple will be sent off
in the afternoon.

660
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,360
I'm going to get some air outside.
Call me if anything happens.

661
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,400
<i>Why do we have to involve</i>
<i>that elderly couple?</i>

662
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,720
They're not even relatives.

663
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,640
Well,

664
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,120
they're distinguished citizens
of the province.

665
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,520
And they've been together for decades.

666
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,200
Most importantly,
they're faithful to each other,

667
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,720
unlike some people
who have a wife in every country.

668
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,840
Auntie, you agreed not to ruin the mood.

669
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,680
Besides, there's an old belief.

670
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,600
If the ones
preparing the bed for the couple

671
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,400
bear ill will,

672
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,000
the couple won't be happy in marriage.

673
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,880
If I let you prepare it,

674
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,920
Ranee would surely suffer,

675
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,160
because I'm certain you

676
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,480
and my niece will never get along.

677
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,040
Is Mom planning
to take everything back from Chen, Dad?

678
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,920
Who manages the rice mill's accounts now?

679
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,040
-I do.
-From today on,

680
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,000
the person in charge
will be the first daughter-in-law.

681
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,320
Thank you, Mom.

682
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,840
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>who can mend this family.</i>

683
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,200
I'm counting on you, Rawee.

684
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,840
If I'm going to go against Chen and Hong,

685
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,160
you won't be mad, right?

686
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,320
He never thought of me as a brother,
so why should I see him as one?

687
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,680
This is Chomechawee, my wife.

688
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,000
Dad, do you think there's a way
Mom would ever accept her?

689
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,960
Chome.

690
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,320
