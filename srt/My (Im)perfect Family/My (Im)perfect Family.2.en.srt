1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Hey! Bike! Bike!

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
What kind of driving was that?

3
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
<i>Who are you?</i>

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm Mr. Jiw's son.

5
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
Call the police and have him dragged out!

6
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,160
Chen…

7
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,560
really is my son.

8
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,360
I go to a boarding school in Bangkok too.

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,320
Cute girl alert!

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
Let's go back.

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,360
Where are you going, sweetheart?

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,600
Let's go.

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,600
Rawee!

14
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
Chen!

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,160
Mr. Rawee's drowning!

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,920
It's lucky Chen was there to help.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,880
Otherwise, he'd already be
with Grandpa and Grandma in Heaven.

18
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,440
Do you think the blood will wash out
of the handkerchief?

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
You're really worried about it?

20
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,240
Well, it's his. I can't give it back
with my blood on it, can I?

21
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,760
If the stains don't come out,
I'll just buy him a new one.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,640
Anyway,

23
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,200
Mr. Rak seems like a kind person.

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
His name is Rawee.

25
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
You remembered his name so clearly.

26
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm not talking to you anymore.

27
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,680
It's fine if it's just a passing thought,

28
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,400
but don't actually fall for him.

29
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
It's not possible.

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,640
Our families have been
enemies for a long time.

31
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
Madam would never allow
a relationship between you two.

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Come on, Cha-aim.

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
I only met him today.

34
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,520
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
He probably has a girlfriend already.

36
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,200
That's true.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,560
-Now go. I want to sleep.
-Yes, miss.

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,160
Just don't dream about him, all right?

39
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
<i>Are you all right?</i>

40
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
What kind of driving was that?

41
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
Mind if I walk with you?

42
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
It's not like I own this place.

43
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,520
Whoa! Oh, man!

44
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,440
Wow.

45
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,600
Hey, what are you looking at?

46
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
Nothing!

47
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
Hey!

48
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
Is that a dirty magazine?

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Let me see!

50
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
Hey.

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
You're too young for this.

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,160
-Come on, let me see.
-No.

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,120
-Just a peek. It's all right.
-No.

54
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,440
Or I'll tell Mom.

55
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,680
Fine, but don't tell Mom.

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
I won't.

57
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,880
Come sit here.

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480
LOVE AND DESIRE

59
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,760
-Whoa…
-That's enough.

60
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,000
Please!

61
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,640
Just one more page!

62
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
No. Go.

63
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,600
Mom might hear.

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,080
Wee, come see this.

65
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
Come.

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
No way! I'm not looking.

67
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay, just one more page.

68
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,080
Wow!

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh!

70
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,680
Don't crease the pages!

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,160
<i>My mom kicked me out.</i>
<i>I really have nowhere to go.</i>

72
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,680
<i>I'll go with whatever</i>
<i>you're most comfortable with.</i>

73
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
<i>Can I ask for something?</i>

74
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
What is it?

75
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,600
I want to continue my studies.

76
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
You just got here. What makes you think
you can get everything right away?

77
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,240
I was just afraid you might forget, Madam.

78
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,360
I'll hire a local tutor first.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>Once you're ready, we'll talk.</i>

80
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,160
If I don't get to continue my studies,

81
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
you'll see what I can do.

82
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
See you on Friday, Auntie.

83
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,080
Oh, in a couple of days,
I'll be heading to Bangkok

84
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,920
for a friend's daughter's wedding.

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,640
I'll pick you up
so we can have a meal together.

86
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,720
Okay, I'll be going now.

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,040
All right,

88
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,400
but don't forget to bring back another
first-place rank for me like always.

89
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
Yes, Auntie.

90
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Go on now, or you'll be late for assembly.

91
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,640
Yes, Auntie. Goodbye.

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Goodbye.

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
Make sure your uniform is tidy.

94
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,640
Don't forget to bring me
some snacks from Bangkok, okay?

95
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
Sure!

96
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Wait, Young Miss!

97
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
Wait, wait!

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,679
Oh.

99
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,680
This is sweetened sake fruit.

100
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,600
Share it with your friends

101
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,840
when you get hungry, okay?

102
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

103
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Gently, don't hug too tightly.

104
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,360
That felt good!

105
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,040
For me too, dear.

106
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
-I'm off now!
-Go now, dear.

107
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,800
-Good luck!
-Goodbye.

108
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
Go. Good luck.

109
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
Somneuk.

110
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
Drive carefully.

112
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,320
Bye.

114
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,720
Bye.

115
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Make sure you all focus
on your studies, all right?

116
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,840
I don't want your teachers
calling me again,

117
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
especially you, Wee.

118
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,880
Oh.

119
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Yes, Mom.

120
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,240
Off you go.

121
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,560
Yes.

122
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm off now, Mom.

123
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Go on.

124
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,240
Mom!

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
-That's enough.
-It feels nice.

126
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,760
-Go now.
-Love you, Mom.

127
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
-Go!
-Don't forget to miss me!

128
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
Go now!

129
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,640
I'll study hard.

130
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,920
Let's go!

131
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,640
What are you looking at?

132
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,040
Today, go clear the weeds around the mill.
They've gotten so overgrown.

133
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,200
When is the teacher coming to tutor me?

134
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,760
Stop pestering. That's annoying.

135
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,560
Ngor, if you finish kitchen duties early,
go teach him something today.

136
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes, ma'am.

137
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,160
I'll be your teacher today,

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,880
LOVE AND DESIRE: YOUNG LADY

139
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,240
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH MEN

140
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,760
Where's Wee?

141
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
Haven't seen him.

142
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,640
Maybe in the library?

143
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
No.

144
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
I just came from the library.

145
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
I didn't see him there.

146
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,240
Where else could he be?
Probably somewhere in school.

147
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
All right.

148
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,560
Okay.

149
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Please, have a seat.

150
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm getting anxious.

151
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,960
How's the property by the old market?
Are you happy with my offer?

152
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
Your offer is better than anyone else's.

153
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,960
Then let's seal the deal.

154
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Let's not rush, ma'am. I need a little
more time to think it through carefully.

155
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,720
What is there to think about?

156
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
If there's something holding you back,
just tell me directly.

157
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,400
Good morning, ma'am.

158
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
Is your mistress home?

159
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,720
Yes, she is.

160
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,640
Well, she already has a visitor, ma'am.

161
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,640
Oh?

162
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,200
But Prakai scheduled an appointment
with me first. Who beat me to her?

163
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,560
It's Madam Mei.

164
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,640
It’s not about who offered first.
It’s the offer that matters.

165
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,160
Why should you

166
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
sacrifice profit for the sake of courtesy?

167
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,400
Once a crooked merchant,
always a crooked merchant.

168
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,640
You shriveled hag!

169
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,160
Did you just insult me?

170
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Oh, please, who else?

171
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
Is there

172
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,080
any other market hag like you around here,

173
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,480
Mei Hua?

174
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
Come on.

175
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Let's all calm down and talk nicely.

176
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,400
I have nothing to say to her.

177
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,280
Dear, there's no need to overthink this.

178
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Let's just give preference
to fellow Thais first.

179
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,840
And what part of me isn't Thai?

180
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,600
I was born on Thai soil, just like you.

181
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,200
Come on.
Let's not divide each other like this.

182
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,600
Thai or Chinese, we're all one family.

183
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,800
I've known you both for years.

184
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,240
You're both old-timers in this province.

185
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,480
My dear, please don't compare me
to this woman.

186
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,120
We're not in the same league.

187
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
I may have been a market vendor,

188
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
but I made an honest living

189
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,200
and built myself up from nothing.

190
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
Not like those so-called old money types

191
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,320
who got rich off gambling,

192
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,280
horse racing, and selling lottery tickets.

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,560
That's how you got rich.

194
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,560
Mei Hua, you snake-tongued witch!

195
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,400
Enough!

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm not selling to either of you!
You both may leave now.

197
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,160
<i>If you don't tell me,</i>

198
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,040
I'll tell Mom

199
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,320
that you're dating Tub,
Miss Pissamai's stable boy.

200
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,760
Young Master!

201
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
You're so cunning.

202
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,800
Did Tub ever say
which school Ranee goes to?

203
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,320
Oh.

204
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,920
Wow.

205
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,560
Move over! We're buying grilled squid!

206
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,600
Rawee?

207
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,840
Do you know him?

208
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,920
Ask him to buy it for us.

209
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,000
Rawee, can you help
buy us some grilled squid?

210
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,320
Sure. How many do you want?

211
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
How many?

212
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,240
Fifteen skewers.

213
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,040
-And extra sauce, please.
-Got it.

214
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
Hand me the money.

215
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,400
No need. It's on me.

216
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,120
-Wait, no…
-Uncle!

217
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,320
-Uncle! Over here!
-Wow.

218
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,280
Such a gentleman!

219
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,840
Is he trying to flirt with you?

220
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,880
No, he lives near me.

221
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,280
Then why are you blushing?

222
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
You are blushing!

223
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,800
Yes, you're blushing.

224
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,160
Is he hitting on you?

225
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,800
No, he's not.

226
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,839
Quiet down. He might hear.

227
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,240
I've got it!

228
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,520
Well…

229
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,440
I'll pass it over the top, then?

230
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay.

231
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,880
Be careful.

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,119
Be careful.

233
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,119
Thank you.

234
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
We've got it!

235
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
Good afternoon, ma'am.

236
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,480
Where are you going?

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,960
Wee's been gone for too long.
Let's go find him.

238
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,560
Yeah, let's go.

239
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,880
Rak! Go to the disciplinary office now!

240
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,280
-Why?
-Just go.

241
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920
Ranee,

242
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
you're not eating?

243
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
What kind of punishment will he get?

244
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,960
What were you doing at the girls' school?

245
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,480
DISCIPLINARY TEACHER

246
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Nothing, sir.

247
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,680
The teacher there caught you

248
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,520
climbing over the fence. Don't lie.

249
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,400
Who were you visiting?

250
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,240
No one, sir.

251
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,680
Stubborn little liar!

252
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,040
Come in.

253
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,840
Good, Rak, you're here.

254
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,440
Your brother snuck out of school

255
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,480
and tried to climb
into Pikulkaew Girls' School.

256
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,440
Luckily, the teacher caught him

257
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,480
and sent him back.

258
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,840
With a witness this solid,

259
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,440
you still deny

260
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,400
meeting anyone?

261
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,240
Do you know if Rawee
has any female friends

262
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,680
at that school?

263
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,120
He's never had a close female friend.

264
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,720
It must be a misunderstanding, sir.

265
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,600
So you're all covering for him?

266
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,840
If he doesn't confess,

267
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,240
I'll have to call your parents

268
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,360
and discipline you
according to school rules.

269
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm very sorry, Teacher.

270
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,760
Rawee is complicated.

271
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,840
He seems obedient,

272
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,920
but he's secretly stubborn.

273
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,560
He has strange ideas.

274
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,800
That's just the kind of person he is.

275
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,560
He'd rather be hated

276
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,800
than cause trouble for others.

277
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,200
You can punish him
according to the rules. I understand.

278
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,080
I'll send someone
to bring him home tomorrow.

279
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm very sorry again.

280
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,800
He's constantly causing me headaches.

281
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,760
Rawee probably has his reasons.
He's just not saying them.

282
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,040
But I believe
he didn't do anything terrible.

283
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,400
He's the hardest one to understand.

284
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,360
Because we saw that he's smart, diligent,
and more responsible than anyone else,

285
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,000
maybe that's why
we ended up neglecting him.

286
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,640
He's acting out just to get our attention.

287
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,760
So what's the punishment?

288
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,680
A three-day suspension.

289
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
All right.

290
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,720
And what about Chen's schooling?

291
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
We could ask the teacher…

292
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,800
Let's talk about that later.

293
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,560
I've got enough headaches today.

294
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,040
There's trouble every single day!

295
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,600
Just tell me the truth.

296
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,720
Who were you going to see
at the girls' school?

297
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,400
It was Ranee, wasn't it?

298
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,800
Hey?

299
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Really? You're crushing on a girl?

300
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,920
It's not funny, bro.

301
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
It really is her…

302
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,640
You're asking for trouble, Wee.

303
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,240
You know too well that her aunt
and our mom are like oil and water.

304
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you really think Ranee would like you?
Her aunt hates our family.

305
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,120
I don't know.

306
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,960
All I know is that…

307
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,200
it was love at first sight.

308
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
Whoa!

309
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Listen to you. What are you,
the lead in a romance novel?

310
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm done talking. I'm going to shower.

311
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,240
What?

312
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,560
It might be real.

313
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,680
You've just never felt it.

314
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,560
Come on, now you too?

315
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,120
Let's go take a shower.

316
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,320
Let me try.

317
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,600
Oh.

318
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,800
First time here?

319
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah. First time.

320
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,280
You've come to the right place.

321
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,760
This is the most famous brothel in town.

322
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560
Come on in, sweetheart.

323
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,280
Why are all of you back home?

324
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,400
I can't focus in class without Wee, Mom.

325
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,640
You're just lazy.

326
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,600
I just missed you, Mom. So I came home.

327
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,840
Oh, please. Both of you are just lazy.

328
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
And you, troublemaker!

329
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
You always bring trouble.

330
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,600
-Let me smack your head.
-Calm down.

331
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,920
Calm down, Mom.

332
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,640
Calm down.

333
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,680
Go upstairs and study.

334
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,960
Don't come down unless it's for a meal.

335
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,240
What if I get thirsty?
Can I come down for water?

336
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,360
-Still trying to negotiate?
-Mom!

337
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,520
No, Mom.

338
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,600
You need to keep him in line.

339
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,920
He's the only one
who gives me a headache every single day.

340
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,560
Come on, Mom.

341
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,200
He's the top student.
So what if he's a little weird?

342
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,440
That's a fair trade-off, right?

343
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,800
Mom,

344
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm starving.
What did you make for me today?

345
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
Got my favorite?

346
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,800
There's plenty.

347
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,280
-Go eat.
-Let's go.

348
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,760
-Let's go.
-Yay!

349
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,400
I want fried chicken.

350
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
Where are they?

351
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,120
What?

352
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,520
Are you looking for these books?

353
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,720
How did you get them?

354
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,720
You like looking at these?

355
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,080
Every guy does.

356
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,760
Give them back.

357
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,080
You can borrow some if you want.

358
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,480
Why would I need pictures?

359
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,400
I’ve experienced the real thing.
Not just looking like you.

360
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,640
Have you ever slept with a girl?

361
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,040
No.

362
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,800
What? I did when I was Korn's age.

363
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,920
Want to lose your virginity?
I'll take you.

364
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,560
All three of you.

365
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,680
I'm the eldest brother.
I'll cover everything.

366
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,480
Virginity?

367
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
What does it mean?

368
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
You really don't know?

369
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,800
No.

370
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,960
Do you?

371
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Look at me.

372
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,520
I don't.

373
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,280
Tonight,

374
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm taking you both.

375
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,360
Trust me, you'll love it.

376
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,160
Can I skip this?

377
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,320
Come on, you already climbed
over a school wall for a girl.

378
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,360
Sneaking out
with your brothers is nothing.

379
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,240
-What are you afraid of?
-Yes.

380
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,520
Do you want Mom to scold me alone?

381
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,480
We're brothers.

382
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,880
We share the good and the bad.

383
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,000
-That's how it works.
-Well…

384
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,680
What are you boys talking about?
Why aren't you asleep?

385
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,840
Go to sleep!

386
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,000
We're going to bed now, Mom!

387
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,640
Wake up early tomorrow and study.
Don't let this time off go to waste!

388
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,520
Yes, Mom!

389
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,520
You won't let me go to school?

390
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,600
Then your kids won't have a future either.

391
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,000
Thank you.

392
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,920
Come on in!

393
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,520
The girls are waiting inside!

394
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,560
-Hello.
-Hello.

395
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,080
We'll take care of you.

396
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,200
Hello.

397
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,840
Don't be too hard on us, please.

398
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,000
Please come in.

399
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,960
Wow.

400
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,520
-He's cute.
-Calm down.

401
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
Dear.

402
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,720
I thought you weren't coming.

403
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
I brought my brothers here.

404
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
Please find them some girls.

405
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
They're all so handsome.

406
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,440
What kind of girls do you like?

407
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,560
I'll find the perfect match for you.

408
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,880
I like girls like you.

409
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
Hey! She's mine.

410
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,160
I'll take care of everything.
You'll love it.

411
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,280
Well, I think I'll wait outside.

412
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,640
Korn.

413
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,560
Why are you leaving?

414
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,560
Don't be scared.

415
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,640
A real man needs to be good at everything.
You can't just be good at studying.

416
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,760
I'll just wait at the entrance.

417
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,560
Korn!

418
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,320
It's all right.

419
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,160
Then

420
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,400
let's go, boys!

421
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,960
Come on.

422
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,560
Wow.

423
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,000
You're as handsome as a movie star.

424
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,560
Don't be scared.
I'll teach you everything.

425
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,320
Take off your shirt.

426
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,200
Oh.

427
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Are you nervous?

428
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,400
Your heart's racing.

429
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,360
Yes.

430
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,120
Don't be afraid.

431
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,000
I'll be gentle.

432
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,480
Ouch!

433
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,520
-Korn!
-Wee!

434
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,560
How was it?

435
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,960
I can't stay here!

436
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,600
Wee!

437
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,120
You only brought in young clients.

438
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,639
They may be young,
but they've got deep pockets.

439
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,719
I'll keep bringing them.

440
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,800
Just get them a new girl every time.

441
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,040
The more experienced, the better.

442
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,880
Hook them to this place.

443
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,239
Why not let me have one?

444
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,320
With my skills, they'd be obsessed.

445
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,920
But I'm the one bringing them in.
Who would I be with?

446
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,080
Don't sulk, dear.

447
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,760
Tell us, bro! What was it like?

448
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,680
I need every detail, please!

449
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,720
Why don't you ask your beloved Wee?

450
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Wee?

451
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,880
He bolted out of there like he saw a ghost
in the first five minutes!

452
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,280
Really?

453
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,520
Yes.

454
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,120
My poor little brother…

455
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,880
Come on.

456
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,560
It was my first time.
I totally freaked out.

457
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,240
So? Come on, tell me everything.

458
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
What did she do? What did she do?

459
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm not telling you. Go try it yourself.

460
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,760
Hey, no.

461
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm not letting you sleep
until you tell me!

462
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,200
-Tell me.
-What?

463
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,920
Get up.

464
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What do you want?

465
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,960
How was it?

466
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,360
-Tell me.
-I don't know.

467
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,600
Did she do this?

468
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,760
-Like this?
-Stop, that tickles!

469
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,840
You want to hear too?

470
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,960
Come on.

471
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,680
How was it?

472
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
Where are you going?

473
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,720
Goodbye, Teacher.

474
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Auntie.

475
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,800
Good evening.

476
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,840
Good evening. Good evening, dears.

477
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,000
Bye.

478
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,480
You're early, Auntie.

479
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,480
Hey.

480
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,280
Did you hear about the three brothers?

481
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,240
Which three?

482
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
What do you mean which?
Mei's sons, of course.

483
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,880
What happened?

484
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
I don't know all the details,

485
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,640
but apparently, they got in trouble
and got suspended from class.

486
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,200
They must've done something serious.

487
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,560
Hello.

488
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,320
Which one was it?

489
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,640
All three of them!

490
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,280
-All of them?
-Exactly.

491
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,240
Didn't I warn you? I was right.

492
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,080
I told you to stay away from them

493
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
and not to get involved with that bunch.

494
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,760
-Yes, Auntie.
-All right.

495
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,480
Go drop off your things.

496
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,960
We'll leave soon.

497
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,080
Auntie.

498
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,000
Can I go home with you today instead?

499
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,920
Why? Don't you have school tomorrow?

500
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,960
I have exams next week.
I want some peace and quiet to study.

501
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Fine, up to you.

502
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,280
-Thank you! I'll just go grab my things.
-All right.

503
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,920
-Go on then.
-Yes.

504
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
She never skipped school
even when she was sick.

505
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
Stop playing that guitar.

506
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,680
You're bothering your brothers. Go to bed!

507
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Yes, Mom.

508
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Bet they're both dreaming about girls.

509
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,920
-Hello.
-Welcome.

510
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,160
Dear.

511
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,920
I'll take care of you tonight.

512
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
-All right.
-How have you been?

513
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Uh…

514
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,400
I've been good.

515
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I'll take you to our room.
This way, please.

516
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,040
TANJAI MEDICINE

517
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,880
SCIENCE

518
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,720
TANJAI MEDICINE

519
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,960
Where's Rak?

520
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,800
Since he got home,

521
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,720
he hasn't joined us for breakfast any day.

522
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,720
He's not up yet, Dad.
He was up studying really late last night.

523
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,240
He's unusually diligent this time around.

524
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Well, he's finishing high school soon.

525
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,480
It's just last-minute panic kicking in.

526
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That's a relief then.

527
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,120
Korn, you should take after Rak.

528
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,520
All you ever do is strum that guitar.

529
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,280
Come on, Mom. I'm just a crouching tiger,

530
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,200
hidden dragon type of person.

531
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,320
Just watch, I'm going to get first place
in class and surprise everyone!

532
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,720
You big talker.

533
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,560
Here, eat this,

534
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,680
my little genius.

535
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,080
Thanks, Mom.

536
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,080
You too, Wee.

537
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,680
Here.

538
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,480
Is this the prize for the top student?

539
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,800
Chan, what is it?

540
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,680
-Young Master, come here.
-What is it?

541
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,440
I have news about Miss Ranee.

542
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,960
What did you hear?

543
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,200
Ugh, you're so greedy.

544
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,880
Come on, sir. This could cost me my job.

545
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,400
If Madam finds out, I'm done for.

546
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,480
Fine, I'll give it to you. Now tell me.

547
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,040
Miss Ranee came home already.

548
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,320
What? Really?

549
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Yes.

550
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,680
Do you want to go to the market
this evening? I'll tell Tub to arrange it.

551
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Can we go in the afternoon?
Mom and Dad won't be home.

552
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,120
And what are you going to tell Aunt Ngor?

553
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,200
He seems obedient, doing everything
you tell him to do, ma'am.

554
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,480
He's probably hoping he'll get
to go back to school. Keep dreaming.

555
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,440
Should I still teach him today?

556
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Chen.

557
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,400
Dad!

558
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,640
I brought you some water
and bought you new clothes.

559
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,880
Thank you, Dad.

560
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,360
So much affection, disgusting.

561
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,080
Ngor,

562
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,680
you don't need to tutor him anymore.

563
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,520
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,720
Let's make it clear.

565
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,320
I'll keep him as a laborer.

566
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,600
No schooling like he dreams of.

567
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,400
That's good, ma'am. That way,
he won't compete with the young masters.

568
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,600
Keep a close eye on him.

569
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,120
-I'm off to collect rent.
-Yes, ma'am.

570
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,960
They're always dodging payment.
I have to go deal with it myself again.

571
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,400
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,600
This is so refreshing, Dad.

573
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,040
So, who did Mei hire to teach you?

574
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,600
Aunt Ngor.

575
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,760
Ngor? She didn't even get an education.

576
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,800
She only picked things up here and there.

577
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,080
How can she teach you?

578
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,000
I know.

579
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,520
Madam just doesn't want me to study.

580
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,680
She's afraid
I'll end up better than her sons.

581
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,320
Don't think that way.

582
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,440
Mei's sons are my sons too, your brothers.
You share my blood just the same.

583
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,320
Then,

584
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,760
I'll be the one to teach you.

585
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,720
Really, Dad?

586
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,880
Let me find some books first.

587
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,000
I'll teach you what I can.

588
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,480
And we'll find a way

589
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,400
to get you back to school later.

590
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,960
Thank you, Dad.

591
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,920
How's everything, Tub?

592
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
All good, miss.

593
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,880
Chanraem asked me to give you a letter.

594
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,880
From your girlfriend?

595
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,720
You…

596
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,120
You know about that?

597
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,840
I've seen you two sneaking off
at the market plenty of times.

598
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,720
Please don't tell Madam about it.

599
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,480
If I were going to,
she'd have known long ago.

600
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,880
Thank you.

601
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,040
Thank you.

602
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,400
<i>It's me, Rawee,</i>
<i>the grilled squid delivery guy.</i>

603
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,360
<i>Chanraem told me you're back home,</i>

604
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,000
<i>and I really want to see you.</i>
<i>It's important.</i>

605
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,120
<i>Well,</i>

606
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,880
<i>I don't have a handkerchief to use.</i>
<i>I'd like mine back.</i>

607
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,200
<i>I'm going to the temple today.</i>
<i>If you're free, come meet me.</i>

608
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,240
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

609
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,120
Let's go, miss.

610
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,440
Come on.

611
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,760
Go, miss.

612
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,920
Go.

613
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,840
We're like matchmakers now.

614
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Is this a good idea?

615
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,720
Why not? It gives us a reason
to see each other more.

616
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,720
Or do you not want to see me anymore?

617
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,040
Of course I do.

618
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,480
Do you want to go somewhere
outside the temple to talk?

619
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,400
That way, it's not a sin.

620
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Let's go.

621
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,560
Hurry up. We don't have much time.

622
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,480
I thought you wouldn't come.

623
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,600
I was worried someone
might not have a handkerchief to use.

624
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,320
That's such a lame excuse.

625
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,600
I don't know what I was thinking.

626
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,000
But if I had said

627
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,080
that I missed you

628
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,200
and wanted to see you,

629
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,560
I was afraid it would scare you off.

630
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,880
It's clean now.

631
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,240
Thank you.

632
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
All right.

633
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,320
I don't think I'll use it anymore.

634
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,080
I'll keep it under my pillow.

635
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,400
I should go now.
I've been out for a while.

636
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,600
Will we see each other again?

637
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,480
I wish we had more time together.

638
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,200
After exams,
I'm going on a trip with friends.

639
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,440
You can come too, if you want.

640
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,080
Where to?

641
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,920
Don't you already have a spy?

642
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,960
They're still not down yet?

643
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,840
Go call them
or they'll be late for the exam.

644
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,160
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,400
Oh, here they come.

646
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,560
Hurry up, Korn.

647
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,720
So, Korn, did you finish
reviewing your lesson?

648
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,440
Of course, Dad.

649
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,480
Only one chapter though.

650
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,400
Oh?

651
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,160
How many chapters are there?

652
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,920
Korn, are you even going to pass?

653
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,280
Just showing up to the exam
is an achievement already!

654
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,320
Didn't you say you were
a crouching tiger, hidden dragon type?

655
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,800
More like a sleeping tiger.

656
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,680
Dad! Mom!

657
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,680
What is it?

658
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,040
Rak's got a high fever.

659
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,400
Oh. Give it to me.

660
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,640
How are you feeling?

661
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,840
You're burning up.

662
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,520
I don't think I can go to the exam, Mom.

663
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,960
And today's your final exam.
You had to get sick now?

664
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,120
Let's go see a doctor.

665
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,680
I don't want to see a doctor.

666
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,480
You're sick.
How else are you going to get better?

667
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,760
Can I speak to Dad alone?

668
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,400
Why not talk to me? Why only your dad?

669
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,080
Just leave first, Mei.

670
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,600
You two as well.

671
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,920
Yes, Dad.

672
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,400
What's going on?

673
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,480
I don't know, Dad.

674
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,400
It burns when I pee…

675
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,760
It's red and swollen too.

676
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,200
Oh, no.

677
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,680
You went to a brothel, didn't you?

678
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,760
Dear.

679
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,240
What's wrong with him?

680
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,840
Judging by the symptoms,

681
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,000
I think…

682
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,440
it's gonorrhea.

683
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,160
-Gonorrhea?
-He caught a disease?

684
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,920
Gonorrhea?

685
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,720
How is that possible?
He's never gone to a brothel.

686
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,880
I think we should let a doctor confirm.

687
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,240
Tell me the truth.

688
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,160
Tell me!

689
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,400
Speak!

690
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:24,960
Mom…

691
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,440
I'm sorry.

692
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,320
How could you?

693
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,880
I told you not to go!

694
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,400
Why didn't you listen?

695
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,440
Why didn't you listen?

696
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,800
Mom!

697
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,400
Calm down.

698
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,040
He's sick.

699
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,720
He disgraced himself!

700
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,920
Just let him die!

701
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,520
Tell me.

702
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,720
Which one of your friends
dragged you into this mess?

703
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,560
I'll deal with them myself!

704
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,520
Tell me!

705
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,720
He made a mistake.

706
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,960
As parents, we need to help him,

707
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,000
not…

708
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,480
Don't preach to me!

709
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,560
Go lecture your son!

710
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,080
Mom!

711
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,640
You two, go to school
before you miss your exam.

712
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,320
Yes, Dad.

713
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,760
You were the one
who took Rak to the brothel, weren't you?

714
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,520
I won't let you wreck his life again.

715
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,880
Please don't, Mr. Rak.
Someone might see us.

716
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,760
No one will.

717
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,600
Mr. Rak…

718
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,920
I know you saw me.

719
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
If Mom finds out--

720
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,480
She won't

721
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,600
if you keep your mouth shut.

722
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,880
Have you been waiting long?

723
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,840
I could wait even longer.

724
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,800
<i>I saw you riding your bike with a girl.</i>

725
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,000
Please don't tell Mom.

726
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,960
If you want me to keep quiet,

727
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,200
we need to make a deal.

728
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,240
Tell me what you want.

729
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,960
I'll do anything.

730
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,760
