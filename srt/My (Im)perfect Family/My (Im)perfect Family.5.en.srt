1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,760
Rak!

2
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,840
You!

3
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,320
What's going on? What did my son do?

4
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,600
Your son got my girlfriend pregnant.

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,960
Don't expect me to accept a promiscuous
woman like you as my daughter-in-law.

6
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,240
Never.

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,640
I'm not backing down that easily.
They have no idea what I’m capable of.

8
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm sending all three of you
to study abroad.

9
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,040
So, how can we meet?

10
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,640
My class is at ten o'clock,
Monday to Friday. Come if you're free.

11
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,240
I'm so glad to have a friend
who's pregnant along with me.

12
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,640
Our babies will have playmates.
They won't be lonely.

13
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
Yours will probably be born before mine.

14
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Probably just around the same time.

15
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
But no matter what,

16
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,920
my baby will have to call yours
the older sibling.

17
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't care what Madam thinks.

18
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,360
To me, Mr. Chen is
the eldest son of this family.

19
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Thank you for respecting me and Chen.

20
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,120
We're in the same boat.

21
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,040
Madam sees us both as outsiders.

22
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,560
We need to stick together.

23
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
That's the only way to stand up to her.

24
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
If you're free,
come visit me at the stall anytime.

25
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes, Big Sister.

26
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,399
What are you boiling?

27
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,680
Chinese herbal tea, ma'am.
You said you had mouth ulcers.

28
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,800
I haven't been sleeping well
for the past couple of nights.

29
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,080
It's almost done, ma'am.

30
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
Thanks.

31
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Once you're done, boil this tonic too.

32
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,760
What kind of medicine is this, ma'am?

33
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,320
It's a tonic for pregnancy.

34
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,760
Boil it and make Chan drink it every day.

35
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,160
She'll be glad to know you care.

37
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,200
It'll be trouble
once her belly gets bigger.

38
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,960
What did you say, ma'am?

39
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
I said don't forget to boil it.

40
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,040
No, ma'am. I won't forget.

41
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,520
Just understand how the machines work.
We don't have to do the work ourselves.

42
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,520
Chen, do you like working here?

43
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,880
I can do anything

44
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,760
that helps lighten Dad's load.

45
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,720
Wow.

46
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,240
Dad's lucky to have you.
Otherwise, he'd be tired all alone.

47
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,640
Once the three of you graduate,
he'll have plenty of help.

48
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,120
No way. I don't like working
at the rice mill. I won't do it.

49
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,760
Then why'd you ask to work here?

50
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,200
Because Mom said
I couldn't just sit around.

51
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,080
If you want to go see your girl, just go.

52
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,760
Are you sure?

53
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
Go quickly and come back quickly.

54
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,680
I know what it's like to be in love.

55
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
Thanks, Brother.

56
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,040
You helped me and Hong before.

57
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Consider this payback.

58
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,320
Then, I'll go and come back fast.

59
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,400
All right.

60
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Who's that, Tub?

61
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,200
An athlete in training?

62
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,000
He's the son of Madam's friend.

63
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,280
TEACHER NATE'S MUSIC CLASS

64
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
It's delicious.

65
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,760
Ranee.

66
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

67
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,600
Have you met Opas yet?

68
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,120
We haven't talked yet.
No, he was out riding.

69
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,120
You both love horseback riding.
You should get along well.

70
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,799
When Opas

71
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,480
saw the horse, he ran off
to the stables and left me behind!

72
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,400
If he stays the week,

73
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
he can ride until he's satisfied!

74
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
All right.

75
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,680
Oh.

76
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,080
Speak of the devil!

77
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,040
Here he is.

78
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Ranee, meet Opas.

79
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,640
Hello.

80
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Hello.

81
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
Excuse me, I'll go get ready.

82
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,400
Where are you off to?

83
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
She has singing lessons.

84
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,400
She's been chosen
to perform for the new principal.

85
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Let Opas drive you then.

86
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,880
He drives well

87
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,280
and has his license.
You don't have to worry.

88
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,600
That way, he won't get bored

89
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,920
listening to us old ladies
talking about the past.

90
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
Opas,

91
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,880
can you drive her?

92
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,160
Sure, Mom.

93
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Cha-aim,

94
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,000
go with them.

95
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,360
-Excuse me.
-Go ahead, dear.

97
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,960
-Come, sit down.
-Yes, Mom.

98
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,000
-Drink some water?
-Sure.

99
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,560
Aunt Pissamai, your horses are so strong.

100
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,920
-Were they good?
-I really liked them.

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,160
Really?

102
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,600
Will the rice be delivered
to the customer on time?

103
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Yes, Dad.

104
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,360
Where is Wee?

105
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh? Was Rawee supposed to be here?

106
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,760
So he didn't come to help you?

107
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
I haven't seen him, Dad.

108
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
All of your younger brothers
are still acting like kids.

109
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,880
I must have raised them too comfortably.

110
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,680
Please don't tell Madam
that Rawee didn't come.

111
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
He'll get scolded.

112
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
Thank you
for looking out for your brother.

113
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,000
Seems like you're the only one
I can truly rely on.

114
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,640
Rawee's still young.
He'll become more responsible in time.

115
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,720
Keep working.
I'm going to talk with Hui for a bit.

116
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
Yes, Dad.

117
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
Hui.

118
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes, sir.

119
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,080
Let me walk you in.

120
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,880
All right.

121
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,120
Mr. Wee.

122
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,400
-Come here. Mr. Rawee.
-Cha-aim.

123
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,200
Who is he, Cha-aim?

124
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
The son of Madam's friend.

125
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,760
Why did he bring Ranee?

126
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,360
He offered. She didn't really want him to.

127
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Is he trying to court her?

128
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,520
Definitely.

129
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,560
He's a real threat.

130
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
I heard he's studying engineering.

131
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
He's just so-so.

132
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
But his mom's really close to Madam.

133
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,560
She's trying to match her son
with the Young Miss.

134
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,800
It all depends on Ranee.

135
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,120
Even the most stubborn heart
softens with time, Mr. Rawee.

136
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,040
And he's staying over
for a whole week too.

137
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,640
A whole week?

138
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
And they like similar things too.

139
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,680
Like what?

140
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,080
Horseback riding.

141
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,760
She said he rides really well.

142
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,720
He even looks like a professional athlete.

143
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,720
Are you still mad at me?

144
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm man enough not to blame others.

145
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,440
You and your brother
are two different people.

146
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
And you've never done
anything wrong to me.

147
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
Why would I be angry?

148
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,960
That's good to hear.

149
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
Also, a single hand can't clap.

150
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
Chan's the ambitious type.

151
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
She's always wanted
to be part of a rich family.

152
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
Anyway, what brings you here?

153
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
Do you need any help?

154
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,080
What's this?

155
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,320
Payment for horseback-riding lessons.

156
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,800
I have more. It's all I've got.

157
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,600
I smashed my piggy bank for it.

158
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
Why do you want to learn?

159
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,640
I want to ride with Ranee.

160
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,200
And I want to look more impressive,

161
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,000
way more than that city guy.

162
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
I get it.

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,680
You're not going to teach me?

164
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,280
I like your spirit.

165
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,720
I'll teach you for free.

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,040
Really?

167
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you so much!

168
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,800
Save that money
to buy Ms. Ranee a birthday gift instead.

169
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,760
It's coming up soon.

170
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
When's her birthday?

171
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,760
Wow, look at this Madam Social Climber.

172
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,400
Completely gone.

173
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,800
Is this girl starving
to death or something?

174
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,880
Did Chanraem drink the tonic?

175
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,120
She did, ma'am. She drank all of it.

176
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,360
Then boil another batch for her.

177
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,240
Consider it making merit for the child.

178
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,840
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,800
PISSAMAI FARM

180
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,079
This is the saddle.

181
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,440
It's like a seat cushion for riding.

182
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,040
These are the stirrups

183
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,839
where your feet go.

184
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,079
To measure the stirrup length,

185
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,119
stretch your arm out from the saddle…

186
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,599
This is the girth,

187
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,760
to secure the saddle tightly…

188
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,280
Rawee?

189
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,440
This is

190
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,040
the bridle.
You use it to control the horse.

191
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,200
Rawee.

192
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,640
Oh, hey.

193
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,880
What are you doing?

194
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,200
Learning how to ride.

195
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
What brought this on?

196
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,520
I want to ride horses with you.

197
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,080
Hello there. Are you Ranee's friend?

198
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,720
Not just a friend.

199
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm someone special to her.

200
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,760
Thank you.

201
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Is everything going smoothly today?

202
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,640
Yes, Dad.

203
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,240
What about Rawee?

204
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,840
I must have left the mill
with the right person.

205
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,320
Rawee probably doesn't like
this kind of work.

206
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,800
But Madam forced him to come here.
She's worried you'd favor me over him.

207
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,480
Ngor,

208
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,480
I'm going out.
Watch over the house carefully.

209
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,000
Is it gone?

211
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,920
Yes, she drank it all.

212
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,360
She must really like the taste.

213
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,800
And how was she after drinking it?

214
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh.

215
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,840
When I went to her room,
she always slept like a log.

216
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
Make her another batch.

217
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,800
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,960
Don't be afraid.

219
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,200
If the horse bucks,
you have to hold steady.

220
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,000
Relax. Don't tense up.

221
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,640
You can't be stressed when riding a horse.
I'm right here. No need to worry.

222
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,080
Okay.

223
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,720
When will I be able to ride like that?

224
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,200
What, are you going
to just sleep all day long?

225
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,840
You aren't going to help me
at all, are you?

226
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,560
Chan, what's wrong with you?

227
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,520
My stomach hurts so bad, Auntie.

228
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,440
Oh?

229
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,680
I feel nauseous,
like I'm going to throw up…

230
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,560
Don't puke here!

231
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Come on, let's go outside. Can you walk?

232
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm dizzy, Auntie.

233
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,080
I…

234
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,400
This isn't looking good.
Let's take you to the doctor.

235
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,280
Are you okay? What's wrong?

236
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
I've been having sharp stomach pains
for two days now, Auntie.

237
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,880
Go see a doctor.

238
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,680
You're pregnant. You need to be careful.
I'll watch the stall for you.

239
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm feeling a bit better now.

240
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,640
-Thanks, Auntie.
-Alright.

241
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,120
Hong!

242
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,760
Hong!

243
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,840
-Are you okay?
-Auntie…

244
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Hold on just a bit longer.

245
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Madam!

246
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,640
Madam! Chan has stomach pains!

247
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,160
Then take her to the hospital.

248
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,400
-Prajak, take her.
-Yes, ma'am.

249
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,000
Be careful.

250
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,960
You're picking things up fast.

251
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,800
You've really lightened my load.

252
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,680
Thank you, Dad.

253
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,080
Soon, I might not even need
to come to the mill anymore.

254
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,400
Anyway,

255
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,880
if I also want to learn about the hotel
operations, would it be possible?

256
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,240
Why not? It's family business.

257
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,160
All my children

258
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,400
should learn everything,
so I'll know who's suited

259
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
to take over which part.

260
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,200
Thank you, Dad.

261
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,640
Chen! Chen!

262
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,520
What is it?

263
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,920
Hong fainted at the market.

264
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,680
She was bleeding too.
No one knows what happened!

265
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,240
Come.

266
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm all right now.

267
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,440
All right.

268
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
What did the doctor say?

269
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,880
It was severe food poisoning,
likely due to an infection.

270
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,360
You eat carelessly.

271
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And the baby?

272
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,200
The doctor said the baby's fine.

273
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,320
But the doctor also said
we should monitor her closely.

274
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,680
Go rest.

275
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,040
-Go.
-Yes, ma'am.

276
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,000
All right.

277
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
Madam, would you like your snack now?

278
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,880
I've lost my appetite.

279
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,680
Dear…

280
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm sorry.

281
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I couldn't save your child.

282
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,160
It's all right.

283
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,520
You're still young.

284
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,000
You can get pregnant again.

285
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,280
Have you liked Ranee for a long time?

286
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,120
Not that long, time-wise.

287
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,520
But feeling-wise…

288
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,360
it feels like forever.

289
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,000
You've got a mouth on you.
Ever been punched in school?

290
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,600
I don't use violence.
Ranee doesn't like that.

291
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,120
Just kidding.

292
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Has Ranee ever mentioned me?

293
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,560
Never.

294
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,560
Our families are pairing us up.

295
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,760
My mother and Aunt Pissamai
have been friends since school.

296
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,560
I came this time to meet her formally.
Honestly,

297
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,680
I like her a lot.

298
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,680
Once we graduate,
we'll likely get married.

299
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,440
Have you even asked Ranee
if she wants to marry you?

300
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,720
She'd never go against Aunt Pissamai.

301
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,960
As for you,

302
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,320
I think you should give up
before it hurts more.

303
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,320
You should take your own advice.

304
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,000
Because Ranee and I love each other.

305
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
Wait.

306
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,560
Let's settle this with a competition.

307
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,320
Whoever loses steps aside
and stops pursuing Ranee.

308
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,320
What competition?

309
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,160
Horseback riding.

310
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I've only just started.

311
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,440
Five laps.
I'll give you a two-lap head start.

312
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,800
First to finish five laps wins.

313
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,680
Be brave. Let's settle it.

314
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,000
Was the baby saved?

315
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,160
No.

316
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,120
It was a very early miscarriage.

317
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,120
I don't know what she ate…

318
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,600
or maybe she lifted something too heavy.

319
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,040
What were her symptoms before that?

320
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,200
Wait a second, Auntie.

321
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,840
Madam.

322
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,920
What did you eat
to end up with such bad food poisoning?

323
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm not sure.

324
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,080
Don't blame it on the tonic I gave you.

325
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,760
I don't, ma'am. I didn't drink it.

326
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,920
Why not?

327
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,320
I didn't like the smell.

328
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,440
But I appreciated your kindness,
and I was afraid you'd be upset.

329
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,960
It was expensive. I didn't want to throw
it away. So, I gave it to Ms. Hongyok.

330
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
She liked it a lot.
So I kept giving it to her.

331
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,760
Why the hell would you do that?

332
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Busybody!

333
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
We need to make a deal.

334
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
How are you feeling?
You had a high fever just now.

335
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,800
My head feels dizzy, dear.

336
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,200
Then rest some more.

337
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.

338
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,840
Did you eat anything unusual lately?

339
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,760
What caused the bleeding?

340
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,160
Not really. I've been careful.

341
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,280
But there was…

342
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,960
the tonic that Chanraem brought.

343
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
What tonic?

344
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,800
I don't know.

345
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,800
Chanraem said
Madam gave it to her to give to me.

346
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,600
Chen?

347
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,560
I hope she'll be fine.

348
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,880
She can have another child.

349
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,400
Madam!

350
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,120
Madam!

351
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,080
If you hate me, take it out on me!

352
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,080
Why did you have to hurt
my wife and child?

353
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,960
Hey? What are you screaming about
in my house?

354
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,480
You came just in time,

355
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,000
to hear how cruel your mother is.

356
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,840
Watch your mouth.

357
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,600
You told Chanraem to give a tonic to Hong.

358
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,200
That's why she miscarried!

359
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,640
Is that true, Mei?

360
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,480
I didn't tell her to do that!

361
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,440
Why would Hongyok lie to me?

362
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,520
It was Chanraem

363
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,920
who meddled
and gave it to your wife on her own.

364
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,760
What kind of tonic?

365
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
A prenatal tonic!

366
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,360
Everyone takes it. I meant well.

367
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,760
I did a good deed,
and now it's being twisted.

368
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,800
Did Chanraem even take it herself, Mom?

369
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,920
Chan is here.

370
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,440
Chan, did you take the tonic from my mom?

371
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,560
Yes.

372
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,560
I can vouch for her. She drank
every drop in the pot every day.

373
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
If you drank it all, how did you have
any left to give to my wife?

374
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,000
I split it in half.

375
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,760
I wanted to please Ms. Hong
since we're both expecting.

376
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,159
If my tonic was poisonous
like you suspect,

377
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,320
Chan wouldn't be standing here right now.

378
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,600
Then how do I know
you all aren't in on it?

379
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
So you're determined to accuse me?

380
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,520
Chen.

381
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,239
I understand you're hurt

382
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,040
and you want answers,

383
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,320
but I can promise you

384
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,400
Mei would never be so heartless

385
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,880
as to kill an unborn child.

386
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,040
Then I'll take your word for it, Dad.

387
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,320
May I go now?

388
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,200
What are you standing around for?

389
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,880
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,960
He stormed into my house

391
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,520
and yelled at me like that.

392
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,680
If you weren't around,
would he even respect me?

393
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,320
I'll go take a shower, then.

394
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,280
Wee.

395
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,600
Three workers were absent today.

396
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Any problems?

397
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
No problems, Dad. Everything's fine.

398
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,000
<i>We need to make a deal.</i>

399
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,080
If anyone asks

400
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,280
whether you drank the tonic I gave you,

401
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,440
you say yes

402
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,120
and that you shared some with Hongyok.

403
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,280
But I didn't take it.

404
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,080
You will say you did!

405
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay, I drank it!

406
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,640
Say what I told you

407
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,360
if you still want to live in this house.

408
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,040
Could the one Madam meant
to poison for a miscarriage

409
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,160
have been me?

410
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Hong?

411
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,480
-Nurse.
-Yes?

412
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,720
Where's the patient in Room 16?

413
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
She's in the operating room.

414
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
Why is she in the operating room?

415
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,400
Ms. Hongyok's condition worsened. She had
abdominal pain and continued bleeding.

416
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,920
Her parents were here
and gave consent for emergency surgery.

417
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,880
What kind of surgery?

418
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,920
A hysterectomy.

419
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,480
<i>I know very well what I did</i>

420
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,800
<i>was wicked…</i>

421
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
<i>But I had to do it</i>

422
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,160
<i>for my son's future.</i>

423
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,360
<i>What happened to Hongyok</i>

424
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,160
<i>wasn't my intention. Even so,</i>

425
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>I was the cause of it.</i>

426
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>I can't deny it.</i>

427
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,720
<i>I accept all karma that comes from this.</i>
<i>Let it fall upon me alone.</i>

428
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,760
<i>Please don't let it</i>

429
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,520
<i>harm my family.</i>

430
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,720
Madam.

431
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,280
I have something to discuss with you.

432
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,360
I heard about Hongyok.

433
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,720
I'm truly sorry.

434
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,000
She must've had
a bad reaction to the tonic.

435
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,200
I want to make it clear again.

436
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,520
I didn't know

437
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,440
Chanraem had given it to your wife.

438
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,200
Whether you believe me or not
is up to you,

439
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,240
but I've told you the truth.

440
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,680
I suppose you can rest easy now

441
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,840
that I can't have a child
to compete with yours.

442
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
You were never a match for my son anyway.

443
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Where's Rawee?

444
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,520
I'd like to know that too.

445
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,560
What do you mean?

446
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm tired of lying for him.
He skips work every day.

447
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,720
Where does he go?

448
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,680
To see his lover.

449
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,720
Rawee doesn't have a lover.

450
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,960
Of course he does.
He talks to me about her every day.

451
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,680
He's completely smitten.

452
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,400
Who is she?

453
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,720
Madam Pissamai's niece.

454
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,600
If I remember correctly, her name's Ranee.

455
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,880
And today's her birthday.
He went to the stables early this morning.

456
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,160
I won't believe your slander

457
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,320
until I see it with my own eyes.

458
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,960
If you don't believe me,

459
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
-then go see for yourself at the stables.
-I will!

460
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,560
Don't you dare

461
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,280
tell Rawee that I know about this.

462
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,920
It's none of my business.

463
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,120
You took my child.

464
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,760
Now I'll make sure
your child causes you endless pain.

465
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,680
Yes.

466
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,160
-Young Miss!
-Hang on. Hey!

467
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,920
Quiet down already.

468
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,400
All right, let's continue.

469
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,920
You're coming, right, Kaew?

470
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,200
Yes, Anong wants to see you.

471
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,960
Yes. See you later.

472
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,560
What is it?

473
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,160
You have to go to the stables now!

474
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,360
Why?

475
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,600
Mr. Rawee challenged
Mr. Opas to a horse race!

476
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,520
Huh?

477
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,880
Yes.

478
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,400
He just started learning.
He's going to get himself hurt.

479
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,040
Hurry. They're about to start.

480
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,000
Let's go.

481
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,960
Yes. It's all right.

482
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,800
PISSAMAI FARM

483
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,320
Has it started?

484
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,240
Why is Rawee riding alone?

485
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,720
Mr. Opas is giving him
a two-lap head start.

486
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,720
How many laps are they racing, Tub?

487
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,240
Five laps.

488
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,320
Why are they even racing, Tub?

489
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,200
Tell me now.

490
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,360
Tub?

491
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,640
They made a deal.

492
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,680
Whoever loses has to back off
and stop courting you.

493
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,360
Lap two. Mr. Opas, get ready!

494
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,200
Do you think he can win?
It's like a turtle racing a rabbit.

495
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,200
But in the end, didn't the turtle win?

496
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,120
Four laps each!

497
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,120
It's a tie now!

498
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,440
Thanks, buddy. You were amazing.

499
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Did you give me a sick horse?

500
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,760
You picked that horse yourself.
It's the one you've been riding every day.

501
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Don't blame the horse
if you can't ride it properly.

502
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,800
A real sportsperson knows
how to win and lose

503
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,040
with dignity.

504
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,120
Miss Ranee also saw the whole thing.

505
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,400
I won. Don't forget our deal.

506
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,680
Fine.

507
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,800
Well done.

508
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,560
Thank you, Tub.

509
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,520
You have no rivals now, Mr. Rawee.

510
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,080
Where's Ranee?

511
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,560
Huh? Where did she go?

512
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,760
She was just here cheering for you.

513
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,760
Then please take care of this.

514
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,360
Yes.

515
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,680
You're amazing, Tub. You taught
a beginner to beat someone like that.

516
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,640
That horse didn't eat yesterday

517
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,120
and trained all day.

518
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,960
How could that horse run five laps?

519
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,560
Just don't tell Mr. Rawee.

520
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
Handsome and cunning…

521
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,560
totally perfect.

522
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,280
Did you see me
win the horse race against Opas?

523
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,960
I did. But I wasn't pleased.

524
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,000
What? Why not?

525
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,280
Why would you challenge him
to a deal like that?

526
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Because I didn't want him
chasing after you.

527
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,120
And what if you had lost?

528
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,400
Even if I had lost,
I wouldn't have honored that deal.

529
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,360
I mean… I'm already in love.
How could I give up

530
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,680
on you just like that?

531
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,440
You're such a sly one.

532
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,960
Yeah.

533
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,880
Winning the race

534
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,000
was your first birthday present…

535
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,600
even though he gave me
a two-lap head start.

536
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,640
You've just started riding,

537
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,920
but what you did was impressive.

538
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,080
So, doesn't that deserve a reward?

539
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,840
I worked so hard, you know?

540
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,720
I had to sneak out to practice
behind Dad and Mom's backs.

541
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,840
My whole body aches,
and then I still had to…

542
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,800
What excuse should I use for sneaking out?

543
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,080
Who is it?

544
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,680
It's me.

545
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,600
Mom?

546
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,520
Yes, Mom?

547
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,280
I'm going to the hotel banquet.
Are you coming with me?

548
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,560
I'll pass.
I don't really feel like dressing up.

549
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Suit yourself.

550
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,960
I'm off now. Your dad's waiting.

551
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,080
Okay, Mom.

552
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,120
Hello, Madam.

553
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,560
Thank you for coming, dear.

554
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,920
It's Ranee's birthday.
Of course I had to come.

555
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,280
This is Wallop, my youngest nephew.

556
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,040
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

557
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,440
He's quite handsome.

558
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,560
Take your aunt to have
some refreshments over there.

559
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,960
Please go ahead.

560
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,640
Toey, hello!

561
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,960
-Hello.
-Alright.

562
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,680
Is this a birthday party
or a matchmaking fair?

563
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,000
There are so many boys.

564
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,880
What's gotten into you today?

565
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,240
You've been moody since this afternoon.

566
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,840
Hello.

567
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,360
What are you doing here?
Got lost on the way back from the market?

568
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,600
I came to find my son.

569
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,120
This isn't an airport.

570
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,960
Aren't your sons supposed to be overseas?

571
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,400
One of them is still here. Rawee.

572
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,680
I guess your dear niece fooled you.

573
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,320
Those two are secretly seeing each other.

574
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,200
Impossible.

575
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,800
I saw your niece kiss my son on the cheek
at the stable earlier today.

576
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

577
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,480
Where is my son?

578
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,840
I don't know.

579
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,560
I do.

580
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,480
Opas?

581
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,080
What do you know? Tell me.

582
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,520
Rawee and Ranee
really are together, Auntie.

583
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,040
I saw a little birthday setup
at the stable.

584
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,760
I think Rawee arranged it for Ranee.

585
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,880
Rawee!

586
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,560
Mom?

587
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,640
You want to ruin your future
over a woman just like your brother?

588
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,080
Watch your mouth!

589
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,000
Don't you dare compare
my niece to a prostitute!

590
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,760
If anyone's future is getting ruined,

591
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,240
it's my niece's,
being seduced by your lying son.

592
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,680
You think your niece is so pure?

593
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,040
All sweet and proper on the outside,

594
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,280
but behind your back,
she's flirting with men.

595
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,440
She even kissed my son in broad daylight.

596
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,840
Don't even try to deny it.

597
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,240
If I don't stop this,

598
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,320
your niece will end up pregnant
and get expelled from school in no time.

599
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,920
You shameless boy-chaser.

600
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,320
You foul-mouthed hag!
Apologize to my niece now!

601
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,280
-Apologize now!
-Auntie, no!

602
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,960
-Don't stop me!
-Auntie.

603
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,640
-Let's go back, Auntie.
-Mei!

604
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,080
Let go of me!

605
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,720
Ranee,

606
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,720
tell me she's lying.

607
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,000
You didn't do what she said, right?

608
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Tell me.

609
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,480
Say something!

610
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,240
I was the one who started it.

611
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,160
Shut up!

612
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,360
Don't take the blame for her.

613
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,720
If she weren't a shameless flirt,
would she have kissed you?

614
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,600
Vile! Disgusting!

615
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,280
Tub! Drag that woman out

616
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,880
before I kill someone!

617
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,320
Stop!

618
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,560
Don't touch me.

619
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,960
I've spent more than enough time
in this disgusting stable!

620
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,240
I'll send Rawee abroad immediately.

621
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,560
Remember,

622
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,240
you two won't ever see each other again.

623
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,480
Go!

624
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,760
Once she finishes high school,

625
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,640
I'll marry Ranee off to Opas

626
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,320
and end this once and for all!

627
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,440
Auntie.

628
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,400
You'd better do what you say.

629
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,480
I will.

630
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,560
Go! Don't you dare
long for her again. Go now!

631
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,280
Ranee!

632
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,400
If you'd just done what you promised me,

633
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,600
none of this would've happened.

634
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,040
As for you two,
I'll deal with you tomorrow.

635
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,040
Come with me.

636
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,120
I love Rawee. I don't think
I can stop loving him, Auntie.

637
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,960
No matter how deep your love is,
you'll never end up together.

638
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,640
You have to help me. Madam
tried to poison me to force a miscarriage,

639
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,280
but it didn't work.

640
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,440
I don't think she's going to stop there.

641
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,560
<i>She's nearly due. I'm scared</i>
<i>she'll die with the baby still inside her.</i>

642
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,360
Or maybe fate
is sparing Rak from misfortune.

643
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,680
<i>Welcome home, Son.</i>

644
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,280
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

645
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,320
