1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,440
You took Rak to the brothel, didn't you?

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,200
I won't let you harm my son again.

3
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Mr. Rak, no. Someone might see.

4
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,440
No one will.

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
Mr. Rak!

6
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,600
I know you saw me.

7
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
What if Mom finds out?

8
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,280
She won't as long
as you keep your mouth shut.

9
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
-Have you waited long?
-I could wait even longer.

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
<i>I saw you biking with a girl.</i>

11
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,680
Please don't tell Mom.

12
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,880
If you want me to keep my mouth shut,
we need to make a deal.

13
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,640
Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Ranee!

15
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Auntie!

16
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,800
Rawee is an excellent student, Auntie.

17
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,320
His grades are even higher than mine.

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,400
He's well-mannered.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
He's a gentleman
and always treats me with respect.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,320
Yet, you've already been holding hands.

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Is that what you call a gentleman?

22
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,560
We were posing for a portrait.

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,080
I allowed him to.

24
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
But I despise his mother.

25
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
That has nothing to do with me.

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,920
No need.

27
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
My mother is her own person,
and I am mine.

28
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,040
How did you get in here?

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
Even if I had rung the bell,

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,280
you wouldn't have let me in.

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,840
So, I decided to climb over the fence.

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,520
And you call him a gentleman?

33
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,280
He's no better than a thief.

34
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,400
I did it because
I was genuinely worried about Ranee.

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
I was the one who invited her out.

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,480
If you must punish her…

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,040
please punish me instead.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,680
Are you trying to earn brownie points?

39
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,160
Huh?

40
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,800
You want me to punish you instead of her?

41
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,480
And what if I tell your mother about this?

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,680
Look at you, turning pale now.

43
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,320
You're still afraid of your mom?

44
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,399
And you think you're ready for love?

45
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,520
If you tell my mother,

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,560
please let me keep dating Ranee.

47
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
Hey.

48
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,040
Everyone, leave.

49
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,640
Ranee, go to your room.

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,920
This is all your fault.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Now I'm in trouble too.

52
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,360
Our Young Miss is in love.

53
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,120
How could you not help?

54
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Yeah.

55
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
From what I see,

56
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,800
I think that young man

57
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
doesn't seem bad at all.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,520
The only issue is he's Madam Mei's son.

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
Exactly.

60
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,960
Madam will surely forbid
this relationship.

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,920
You'd better watch yourself too.

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
You've only known
each other for a few days.

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,920
This isn't lasting love.

64
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
I'll prove it to you.

65
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,640
You're quite stubborn.

66
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
If I didn't truly care for Ranee,

67
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,240
I wouldn't have dared show my face here.

68
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,880
I admire your courage,

69
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
but I think you're still young.

70
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,320
Love shouldn't be
the priority for both of you.

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,400
Education should be.

72
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,600
I forbid you from seeing Ranee again.

73
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
Auntie.

74
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,760
If I weren't Madam Mei's son,

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,680
would you still disapprove of me?

76
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,080
Regardless of who your parents are,
I wouldn't allow her to date at this age.

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Wait until you've finished high school.

78
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
If your feelings remain,

79
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,640
we can discuss it then.

80
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
Now, go home.

81
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,160
Yes, Auntie.

82
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
Goodbye.

83
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
Auntie.

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
What now?

85
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,120
May I write letters to Ranee?

86
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,120
Just to correspond.

87
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,160
You're quite persistent.

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,280
Fine.

89
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,960
Write letters

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,880
or even poems if you wish.

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,360
But no meetings.

92
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,400
Understood?

93
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,080
Thank you, Auntie.

94
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,720
Young love is fleeting.

95
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,280
-Are you tired?
-Not at all.

96
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,480
Our hotel is doing well.

97
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,799
There are guests,

98
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,360
and we're hosting events and meetings too.

99
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,840
-That's good.
-By the way, Mei…

100
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
Chen wants to get married.

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,320
Since the incident with Rak,

102
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,840
he's been improving

103
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,080
and working diligently.
It's been almost a month

104
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
without any issues.

105
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,080
Who would want him?

106
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,680
He's been seeing Hongyok for a while now.

107
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,240
Hongyok is hardworking,

108
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,360
and we know her family.

109
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,720
I think they're a good match.

110
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,440
But it depends on whether

111
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,000
you had Hongyok in mind
for any of our sons.

112
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,680
My daughter-in-law should be better
than a butcher's daughter.

113
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,040
If you want her, go ahead.

114
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,680
Then I'll arrange the wedding.

115
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,400
Keep it small and quiet.

116
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,800
I won't get involved.

117
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,920
He's your son. You handle it.

118
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,880
I appreciate that.

119
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Also, I'd like to buy the house

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,640
Chen is renting as a wedding gift.

121
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,840
Well,

122
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,880
you're going all out for your beloved son.

123
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,200
HAPPINESS

124
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
May the love last forever.
Please take good care of her.

125
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,720
May you have a house
full of children and grandchildren.

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,280
Rak!

127
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,000
-What?
-You!

128
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,960
What?

129
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
Get out!

130
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Why did you hit my son?

131
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,720
He deserves more than that.

132
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,760
-I'll call the police!
-Go ahead.

133
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
Then they can arrest your son too.

134
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,600
For what?

135
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,480
What's going on?
What did my son do to make you so angry?

136
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,200
Your son got my girlfriend pregnant.

137
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,080
Come in.

138
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Don't be afraid.

139
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,560
It's time to confront this.

140
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,720
Rak got Chanraem pregnant.

141
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,200
You must accept her
as your daughter-in-law.

142
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
You can't just get her pregnant

143
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
and throw her out.

144
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,080
Chanraem is a maid in your house, Dad.

145
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,640
Tell me.

146
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,920
He framed you, didn't he?

147
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm asking you!

148
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,960
Chanraem really is pregnant
with my child, Mom.

149
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,400
-Mom!
-Mom!

150
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,920
You're lucky they didn't press charges.

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,040
You barged into their wedding
and punched their son in the face!

152
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,400
I apologize
for causing you disgrace, ma'am.

153
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,640
But I couldn't hold back.
Rak knew Chanraem was pregnant

154
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,800
and still denied it,
saying the baby was mine.

155
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,960
Are you sure you're not the father?

156
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm certain, ma'am.

157
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,600
You've done wrong,

158
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
but you've also done right.

159
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,160
So I'll rule in favor of the defendant.

160
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,920
I won't punish you this time.

161
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,200
Thank you, ma'am.

162
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,120
Now go get to work.

163
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,560
See? Bad blood leads to bad deeds.

165
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,120
They're likely to do bad things.

166
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,600
They're siblings cut from the same cloth.

167
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,920
They must be the same.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,720
Luckily, I stepped in
and separated you from him,

169
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,160
or else it might've been you.

170
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I wouldn't sleep with anyone
before marriage, Auntie.

171
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,160
I trust you.

172
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,520
But him? Never.

173
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,840
Every letter he sends

174
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
must go through me, understood?

175
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
Yes, Auntie.

176
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
How are you feeling?

177
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,520
-Where are they?
-I told them to wait in the living room.

178
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,320
Calm down, Mei! You'll faint again!

179
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
You told him to hit me, didn't you?

180
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
Why would I do that?

181
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,840
Because you wanted everyone to know.

182
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,080
You want to be
my family's daughter-in-law, don't you?

183
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
But the baby is yours.

184
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,600
Are you sure it's Rak's?

185
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
You and your boyfriend

186
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,960
could've schemed
this whole thing to fool us.

187
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
But Tub and I haven't slept together
for two months,

188
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,160
since I began secretly seeing your son.

189
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,360
Chan! You're talking
like you have no shame!

190
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,120
If I let shame stop me,
I'd be raising a child with no father.

191
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,440
Tub wouldn't take the blame
for someone else's child.

192
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,320
Don't expect me to accept

193
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,680
a promiscuous woman like you
as my daughter-in-law.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Never.

195
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,080
But the baby is your own flesh and blood.

196
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,240
I don't accept it!

197
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,040
You seduced my son

198
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,600
and let yourself get pregnant,

199
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,920
hoping for an easy life.

200
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,280
Don't think I can't see right through you.

201
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
Well.

202
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,640
-Mei, I think--
-Dear.

203
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't say a word.

204
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,480
I won't let another Chen

205
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,160
come into this house ever again.

206
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,080
There's only one solution.

207
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,800
I'll give you money.

208
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,839
Take it and leave.
Never set foot in here again.

209
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
Go.

210
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,599
Get out!

211
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
I…

212
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,200
I've got a headache.
I'm going to get some rest.

213
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,960
You two, get out of my sight.

214
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,040
Yes, Mom.

215
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,840
Mei, I think

216
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,320
-you should reconsider--
-Dear.

217
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
I want to be alone.

218
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,320
Chan.

219
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,120
What now? You followed me here
just to scold me again?

220
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,120
What good would scolding you do now?

221
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,040
So what are you going to do?

222
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,200
Pack up and go home, of course.

223
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
You're making the right choice.

224
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
We're just servants.

225
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,920
Getting into it with the rich
only ends one way. We lose.

226
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,280
So the poor are always wrong,
and the rich are always right?

227
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,400
Is that fair?

228
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm not backing down that easily.

229
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,360
They clearly don't know what I can do.

230
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,240
What are you planning?

231
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,520
You'll see soon enough.

232
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,880
Rak,

233
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,320
what if Chanraem sues? What will you do?

234
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,240
What's there to be afraid of?

235
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Dad and Mom have money and influence.

236
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,240
She doesn't stand a chance.

237
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,440
Rak,

238
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,880
but the baby's yours.

239
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
I'm not making a maid my wife.

240
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,920
Rak…

241
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
You both heard what Mom said.

242
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,840
She won't accept her
because she thinks she tricked me.

243
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,920
If I have a kid now,
what decent woman would want me?

244
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,440
You think this is really the end of it?

245
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,080
I think Chan won't let it go.

246
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,480
No woman wants to be a single mom.

247
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,680
Good thing your parents didn't mind.

248
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Otherwise, they might have been furious…

249
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,080
and demanded their daughter back.

250
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
Impossible.

251
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,320
Even if the sky fell,

252
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,120
I'd still end up as your wife.

253
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,160
Hongyok Trongpanich

254
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
is my parents' dream come true.

255
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,640
I promise you,

256
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,600
I'll never let you feel inferior.

257
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,720
One day, everything Dad owns

258
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,920
will be mine.

259
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,760
Be patient. Help me build this future.

260
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,880
That day's not far off.

261
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
I chose the right husband.

262
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,680
Here you go. I'm surprised to see you
doing the shopping yourself today.

263
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,720
Young maids never stay long.

264
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,680
Everyone!

265
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,120
Please hear me out!

266
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,600
That's Chanraem's mom! I recognize her.

267
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm here to demand justice
for my daughter!

268
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,520
We're just poor folks, living day by day.

269
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,520
That's why I had to let my daughter
work for Madam Mei's household.

270
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,440
I never imagined…

271
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,200
that I had sent her into a lion's den.

272
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,720
Chan

273
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,760
was taken advantage of by
the family's son, and now, she's pregnant!

274
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,000
What?

275
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,000
Huh?

276
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,400
And Madam Mei
refused to take responsibility.

277
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,480
She just threw money at my daughter
and kicked her out!

278
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,520
Huh?

279
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,280
Jiw! Where the hell are you?

280
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,880
Come out here and face me!

281
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Let me go! Jiw!

282
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,960
You coward! How did you raise your son?

283
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,280
-Jiw! I said let me go!
-There must be a misunderstanding.

284
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Please excuse me for a moment.

285
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,600
Jiw! Come face me now!

286
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,680
That Chanraem! That venomous snake.
Ungrateful little traitor.

287
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,080
If we let this spread,

288
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,560
Master and Madam's reputation
will suffer even more.

289
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
What do you expect me to do?

290
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,000
Make her my daughter-in-law? Not a chance.

291
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,520
If the call is about what happened
at the market, tell them I'm not home.

292
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,760
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,080
Hello, this is Trongpanich family.

294
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,000
Please wait a moment.

295
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,880
It's the Master on the line.

296
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,640
Yes, dear?

297
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,840
They caused a scene at the hotel too?

298
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,520
What is she planning now?

299
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,240
Once inside,
just ask for the discipline office.

300
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,760
That rotten brat

301
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,400
will get what he deserves.

302
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,800
I'll wait in the car.

303
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,640
Come, dear.

304
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
You're not getting away with this, Rak.

305
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,360
Expelled?

306
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,920
Well, I understand the school's stance.

307
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,080
At least it sets a strong example.

308
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
The punishment is harsh.

309
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
No one will dare repeat the same mistake.

310
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,600
Mr. Rak is the brother of Mr. Rawee,

311
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,000
the one courting you, right?

312
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,880
Yes.

313
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,000
But from what I see,

314
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,720
Mr. Rawee

315
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,240
doesn't seem as wild as his brother.

316
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,440
He just hasn't shown his true colors yet.

317
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,120
Was Rak really expelled?

318
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,080
It's a serious stain on his record.

319
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,760
Such recklessness.

320
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,320
The school probably
already informed the family.

321
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,440
Imagine how crazy Mei must be right now.

322
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,120
Mom.

323
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,880
Do you even know how big this mess is?

324
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,440
And you still have the nerve to sing?

325
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,760
Your dad and I have been humiliated
across town because of you!

326
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,960
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm sorry, Mom.

327
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,720
-I'm sorry.
-Why?

328
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,520
Mom, that's enough.

329
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,200
Get out of my way!

330
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,640
Mom!

331
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,160
You'll kill him.

332
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,680
Let him die!

333
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,920
He's ruined his future with lust.

334
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
The school expelled you.

335
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,600
Your name's in the gutter!

336
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Mom!

337
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,320
How did the school find out?

338
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,360
Because Chanraem's mother
blabbed about it everywhere.

339
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,000
The market, the hotel, the school.

340
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,240
Your father and I

341
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,440
can't even show our faces anymore!

342
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,600
It's because of him!

343
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,440
-Mom!
-Mom, no!

344
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,200
Mom, stop!

345
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,800
-Get out!
-Mom!

346
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,360
Mom! Please stop.

347
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,760
-Let go of me!
-Mom!

348
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,080
-Mom, I'm sorry.
-Mom.

349
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,320
He's already hurt, Mom.

350
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,600
He's hurt, Mom.

351
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,040
Please stop, Mom.

352
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,480
-He's already hurt.
-Let go of me!

353
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Mom!

354
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,520
If you want to live,

355
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,200
don't let me see your face again.

356
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,040
Mom.

357
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Mom!

358
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,600
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

360
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,600
Ngor!

362
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,560
-Ngor!
-Yes, ma'am?

363
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,720
Where is that Chanraem now?

365
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,120
She said she was going back home.

366
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,840
Bring her to me immediately.

367
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,720
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,720
If you don't come back,
what am I supposed to do?

369
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
That's not my concern.

370
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,760
Chan, tone it down.

371
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,360
Madam Mei is lowering herself
to speak with you. What more do you want?

372
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,320
If she wants me back,
she can send a car to pick me up.

373
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,120
Chan! You little brat!

374
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,280
You've caused me so much pain.

375
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm just protecting myself
and my unborn child.

376
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,360
What do you want?

377
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,400
You both must accept me
as your daughter-in-law.

378
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,760
Dad, don't agree to this.

379
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,120
Calm down.

380
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,080
If I agree to your demand,

381
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,440
can you promise me that your parents

382
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,560
won't continue to disgrace our family?

383
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,400
How could I tarnish
my own husband's family's reputation?

384
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,240
Then it's settled.

385
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,400
-Mom!
-Shut up!

386
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,160
Your lust has brought this upon us.

387
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,120
You two, go stay with your brother.

388
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
Yes, Dad.

389
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,720
But I have a condition…

390
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,320
I will only allow Rak to marry

391
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,520
once he completes his education.

392
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,840
You wouldn't want to ruin

393
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,960
your future husband's prospects
any further, would you?

394
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Fine.

395
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,760
From now on, I will live here

396
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,400
as a daughter-in-law,

397
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,280
not a maid.

398
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,360
Your main rival

399
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,040
has tripped over himself.

400
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,800
I never thought

401
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,240
Madam Mei would accept a maid

402
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
as her daughter-in-law.

403
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,200
If she didn't, she'd have been condemned
by the entire province.

404
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,680
She must be fuming now.

405
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,800
Is your dad really going
to give you the rice mill?

406
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,840
Will Madam Mei agree?

407
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,680
That's why I need to prove myself to them.

408
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,240
Korn is incompetent.
I'm not worried about him.

409
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,000
But there's Rawee. He's smart,

410
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,520
but he follows his heart
more than his head.

411
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,920
If I were Dad,

412
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,199
I'd trust him the most.

413
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,560
Still, Rawee is the younger brother.
You're the eldest,

414
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,520
and I'm the eldest daughter-in-law.

415
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,760
But I don't just want the rice mill.

416
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,560
I want to own the hotel even more.

417
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,159
Mei,

418
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,920
why aren't you sleeping?

419
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,960
Dear.

420
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,840
I want to send our three sons abroad
for further studies.

421
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,600
They need to reinvent themselves.

422
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,800
Once they return as overseas graduates,

423
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,200
people will forget all the scandals.

424
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,320
What do you think?

425
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,000
Well.

426
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,800
If it's good for the boys

427
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,480
and gives you peace of mind, go ahead.

428
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,520
-I won't object.
-Thank you, dear.

429
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,840
Is everyone here now?

430
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,080
I'll say this just once.

431
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,520
I'm sending all three of you

432
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,840
to study abroad.

433
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,840
Mom, does that mean I get to go too?

434
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
She clearly said all three of you.

435
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,640
When are we leaving, Mom?

436
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,440
As soon as I can arrange it.

437
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,680
Thank you, Mom.

438
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm going with Mr. Rak.

439
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,240
Oh, please, Chan.

440
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,520
Are you going to cling
to the plane's wheels?

441
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,880
Don't go too far.

442
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,200
Just look at your new room!

443
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,320
You're not a servant anymore.

444
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,160
Living like this

445
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,120
is already a blessing.

446
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,040
I know what's going on.

447
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,160
Madam's sending Mr. Rak abroad
just so he doesn't have to marry me.

448
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,040
And if that's true, what will you do?

449
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,760
That doesn't matter.

450
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,320
I've got her grandchild growing in me.

451
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,920
If my baby gets a good life,

452
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,360
I'll benefit too.

453
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,160
So you're planning to live off the kid?

454
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,160
Luck's on my side.

455
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Chan, Chan.

456
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,280
Auntie.

457
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,120
What's going on?

458
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,280
I have a letter to send.

459
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
I'm pregnant.

460
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,320
Then walk carefully. I need to tell
my friend I'm going to study abroad.

461
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,720
Go on, deliver it for him.

462
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,480
A bit of walking is good for your health

463
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,720
and will make labor easier.

464
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Exactly, Auntie.

465
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,240
Come on, Chan. Please?

466
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,320
Only because you're my brother-in-law.

467
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,320
Thanks, Sister-in-Law.

468
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,560
How do you deliver a letter with no name?

469
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,840
Did you finish reading, Auntie?

470
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,080
He's quite a charmer.

471
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,600
Guys like him?

472
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,680
One hundred percent playboy,
remember that.

473
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,280
Forget him.

474
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,600
What?

475
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,880
Madam Mei

476
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,600
is sending all three of her sons abroad.

477
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,360
But none of them
have even finished high school.

478
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,440
It's probably to escape the scandal.

479
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,120
If I were her, I'd do the same.

480
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,840
But Rawee and Ronnakorn
didn't do anything wrong.

481
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,280
They're brothers.

482
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,800
She's probably sending them
to take care of each other.

483
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,480
Rawee wants to see you one last time.

484
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,400
If you want to see him,
I'll have Tub drive you.

485
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm letting you go

486
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,480
because I trust you.

487
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,080
Don't make me regret it. Got it?

488
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Thank you, Auntie.

489
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,560
-Hey.
-Yes?

490
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,120
Where are you going?

491
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,960
I'm going to the market to buy something.

492
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,440
You dress this fancy just to go shopping?

493
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,560
This is casual.

494
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,360
I'm going now,
before Dad and Mom come home.

495
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,360
Oh?

496
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,160
Mr. Rak, are you here looking for me?

497
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,080
No.

498
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,680
I'm just out for a walk to kill time.

499
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,040
We can talk in my room if you'd like.
Nobody will say anything now.

500
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,160
Aren't you done causing trouble for me?

501
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,080
Since you're leaving to study abroad,

502
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,360
we should spend more time together,
shouldn't we?

503
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,480
No way. You're pregnant. I'm scared!

504
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,600
Mr. Rak!

505
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
Mr. Rak!

506
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,960
Are you scared or trying to abandon me?

507
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,600
It's not going to be that easy.

508
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,080
One way or another, I will become
a daughter-in-law in this house.

509
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,840
Thank you for coming.

510
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,400
I really wanted a portrait
with you as a keepsake.

511
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,000
You should thank my aunt
for allowing me to come.

512
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,880
Then please thank her for me.

513
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,160
Sure.

514
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,600
I waited for your letters
every single day, you know?

515
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,560
Your letters always made me smile.

516
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,600
Sometimes I even laughed out loud
reading them.

517
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,040
I'm happy I could make you smile.

518
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,800
I wonder

519
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,880
if when I read your letters from abroad,

520
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,800
will I still be able to smile?

521
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,080
Because I think I'll miss you a lot.

522
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,880
Please go ahead and pose.

523
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,960
What pose should we do?

524
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,560
As promised.

525
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,720
This one's for you.
We'll hold hands in this one.

526
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,640
Why are you crying?

527
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,080
They're going to study, not to die.

528
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,000
Get in the car.

529
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,760
Mr. Rak,

530
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,680
write to me often, please!

531
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,640
All right.

532
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,080
Mr. Rak.

533
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,960
Get in.

534
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Good luck, everyone.

535
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,360
Safe travels. Please come back soon.

536
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,040
Take good care of the house.

537
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,960
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,280
Young Masters.

539
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,560
Mr. Rak.

540
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,720
Young Masters.

541
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,760
Young Masters.

542
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,880
Be safe.

543
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,200
Miss.

544
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,920
The car is coming!

545
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,560
Then what do we do
so they don't know we're waiting?

546
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,840
Let's pretend we're out for a ride.
I'll pedal.

547
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,680
-Okay, hurry.
-Okay.

548
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,080
Let's go.

549
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,800
Don't cry, miss.

550
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,120
Stay strong.

551
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,280
I'm stuck working here in the rice mill

552
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,960
while her son's off studying abroad.

553
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,080
I'll surpass them all.

554
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,600
Hey!

555
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,480
Hurry up!

556
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,280
There's still more to carry!

557
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,960
Have a look.

558
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,120
There's one good thing
about Mr. Rawee not being around.

559
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,440
Madam won't stop you
from coming to the market.

560
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,760
I'll write and tell him.

561
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,720
No souvenirs from abroad for you!

562
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,520
Miss!

563
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,360
You wouldn't be that mean, would you?

564
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,920
I don't know.

565
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,600
-Let's split up. Meet at the usual spot.
-Okay.

566
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,720
Dad, Mom.

567
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,040
Can I not go study abroad?

568
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,400
Why?

569
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,920
Your dad and I

570
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,240
just asked someone to arrange it.

571
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,280
I want to finish high school first.

572
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,520
I just have one year left.

573
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,280
I don't want to waste my GPA.
I worked so hard to keep it high.

574
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,360
You don't want to go with your brothers?

575
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Yeah, so you can take care of each other.

576
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,880
They both can take care of themselves.

577
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,000
And I don't want you both to feel lonely.

578
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,840
All of a sudden, if everyone's gone,
the house will feel so empty.

579
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,960
I'd feel more at ease.

580
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,680
You all are only causing me trouble.

581
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,480
It's up to you, then.

582
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,800
But no changing your mind later.

583
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,920
Good. At least we'll save money.

584
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,320
Dad,

585
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,520
so I don't have to go, right?

586
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,680
I'd really be lonely without you.

587
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,760
Yes, Dad. Thank you, Dad!

588
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,680
That's enough. I surrender.

589
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,840
Why did you lie to me?

590
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,080
I wanted to know if you really missed me.

591
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,560
From now on, we can secretly meet.

592
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,240
Auntie thinks I'm away.

593
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,880
You're sneaky.

594
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,440
She'll find out that you lied.

595
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,000
You have to help me hide it.

596
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,480
You're wicked.

597
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,400
So, how can we meet?

598
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,640
I'm taking singing lessons.

599
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,840
Oh?

600
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
You want to be a singer now?

601
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,360
No, there's going to be a welcome event
for the new principal next semester.

602
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,680
I was chosen to sing
on behalf of the school.

603
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,040
I'm just afraid I'll embarrass myself.

604
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,320
Where are you taking the lesson?

605
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,720
Teacher Nate's house.

606
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,560
I know it! I used to go with Korn.
He took his guitar lesson there.

607
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,640
Ten o'clock, Monday to Friday.

608
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,280
Come if you're free.

609
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,920
-What's wrong?
-Get me some water, please.

610
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,920
Hong.

611
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,160
Should we go see a doctor?

612
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,680
Going now might be a little early.

613
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,880
Waiting another eight or nine months
should still be fine.

614
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,600
Are you pregnant?

615
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,440
What else could it be?

616
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,760
I'm so happy!

617
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,720
Thank you.

618
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,960
So how are you feeling?

619
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm fine.

620
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,240
No morning sickness yet, Dad.

621
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,160
If you need anything, just let me know.

622
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,360
-Yes, Master.
-What could she possibly need?

623
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,280
All she does is eat and rest.
No work whatsoever.

624
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,280
You're pregnant, not paralyzed.

625
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,400
You still need to help Ngor
with the chores.

626
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,200
Other daughters-in-law
don't get to laze around like this.

627
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,000
When I was pregnant,
I worked until the very day I gave birth.

628
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,640
I was fine.
All three of my sons were born healthy.

629
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,560
When I had Wee,

630
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,280
I even walked myself
to the hospital to give birth.

631
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,800
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,240
If there's anything you need help with,
please just let me know.

633
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,000
Plenty! Just do whatever you used to do.

634
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,640
Yes.

635
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,760
Dad!

636
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,120
Dad! I have good news.

637
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,120
Come in!

638
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,720
Hongyok is pregnant.

639
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,480
Really? I'm happy for you!

640
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,760
What are you so happy about?

641
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,680
Let's wait until it's a boy.

642
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,600
I'm happy for you.

643
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,760
The children will be
around the same age then.

644
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,880
Our luck is turning around!

645
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,280
Or is it a curse?

646
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,160
I'm full now. I can't swallow anything.

647
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,240
Have you two eaten yet?

648
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,680
Not yet. We rushed over
to tell Dad the news.

649
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,240
Then sit down and eat with us.

650
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,440
Ngor, get them a bowl and chopsticks.

651
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,760
Yes, Master.

652
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,360
What kind of medicine is this, ma'am?

653
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,600
It's a tonic for pregnancy.

654
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,640
Boil it and make Chan drink it every day.

655
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,920
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,240
Madam, Madam! Chan's having stomach pain.

657
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,360
<i>-Who is that, Tub?</i>
-The son of Madam's friend.

658
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,040
<i>-Who is he, Cha-aim?</i>
<i>-Madam's friend's son.</i>

659
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,320
Is he courting Ranee?

660
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,880
Are you Ranee's friend?

661
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,120
Not just a friend.

662
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,840
<i>I'm someone special to her.</i>

663
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,720
Rawee!

664
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,000
Mom?

665
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,080
I'm sending Rawee abroad immediately.

666
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,680
You two will never see each other again.

667
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,680
