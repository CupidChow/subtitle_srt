1
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,880
A full diamond set.

2
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,520
The special price is just for today.

3
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm interested.

4
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,759
I've been thinking
about what your mom said

5
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,320
about hiring someone to watch the bar.

6
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
But I don't know
where to find someone like that.

7
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Leave it to me.

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Chat.

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,080
- What are you doing here?
- For the cinema opening, of course.

10
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,240
Get out of here!

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,920
I won't let you wreck this place

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
like you did with my bar.

13
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,160
Ms. Ranee!

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Ranee.

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,040
Congratulations, then.
Your first grandchild

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,800
is Rak's, just like you wanted.

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Good day, sir.

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,880
This way to the lounge, please.

19
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,040
Please, this way.

20
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Dear.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
Why did he ask to meet you?

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,040
I have no idea.

23
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,320
I don't feel good about this.

24
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,040
Did you step on someone's toes recently?

25
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Just Rawee.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
Could it be him?

27
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,760
We'll find out soon.

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
Dear.

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Be careful, all right?

30
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,280
You've come all the way here in person.

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
Anything we can help with?

32
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,760
My assistant told me

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,040
we moved our party's executive meeting
from Master Jiw's hotel to here

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
because of you.

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,160
Yes,

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,880
I offered a better rate than them.

37
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
That's a well-planned move
to poach clients.

38
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,960
I like people who are crafty like you.

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,959
I'll take that as a compliment.

40
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,600
I'd like your hotel
to be one of our sponsors.

41
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,400
It'll be good
for our future collaboration.

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,240
We'd be happy to,

43
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,280
but since we've just opened,

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,320
- we're not yet generating enough--
- Nothing too big.

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
Just the cost of all meeting rooms

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,280
and guest rooms we've booked.

47
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,120
And all food and beverages as well.

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,760
it's just a small favor.

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm sure you won't say no.

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,960
Think of it as great PR for your hotel.

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
I guarantee

52
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,040
your hotel will be
number one in the province.

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,160
I'm glad this partnership is happening.

54
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,960
Of course, sir.

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,920
Should I come with you, ma'am?

56
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,960
No need. Go do your chores.

57
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,040
I want to go pray to the gods
and clear my mind.

58
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Could it be karma

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,640
for what happened with Hongyok and Chan's

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
miscarriage?

61
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,320
Is that why Ms. Ranee lost her baby?

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,080
Watch your mouth.

63
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm sorry, ma'am.

64
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
That girl didn't take care of herself.

65
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,320
Who lets themself
get that skinny while pregnant?

66
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
The baby had no chance of surviving.

67
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,040
That's right.

68
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,280
But that's okay.

69
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,720
We still have Mr. Rak's child.

70
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,840
The real firstborn grandchild!

71
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,720
Come on.

72
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,200
Don't cry.

73
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm sorry…

74
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,840
Nothing to apologize for.

75
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,160
You did your best.

76
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,840
I didn't take care of myself.

77
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
I didn't manage my time well.

78
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't rest enough, didn't eat enough.

79
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
- If I--
- Don't blame yourself.

80
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Please.

81
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,320
If the baby was meant to stay…

82
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,720
even if you did worse than this

83
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,720
or worked harder than this…

84
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,600
they would have stayed.

85
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,320
The important thing is you're safe.

86
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,640
That's the best thing.

87
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
The doctor said

88
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,320
you can have a child again.
Everything will be okay.

89
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Just rest well.

90
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
Are you very upset?

91
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
I should be more upset.

92
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,360
But…

93
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
lately, I've been so consumed by work.

94
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,680
There are problems at the hotel,

95
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
there are problems at the rice mill.

96
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,720
Sometimes,
I forgot you were even pregnant.

97
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,320
Me too…

98
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Our baby must've felt neglected.

99
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,400
That's why they left.

100
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,000
If we'd known
our work would be this tough,

101
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,800
we wouldn't have tried yet.

102
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Let's start over.

103
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,800
Let's start over when we're ready.

104
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,960
Come on, my good girl.

105
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,120
Get some rest.

106
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
I'll stay right here

107
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
by your side.

108
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,720
Here you go.

109
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,280
Oh.

110
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,800
Who's the next victim
of your poisonous herbs?

111
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,680
Watch your mouth.

112
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,000
What does your niece's miscarriage
have to do with me?

113
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
Oh?

114
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
How would I know? You've done it before.

115
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,080
How many have you poisoned
into miscarriage?

116
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,480
No shame, no fear of karma?

117
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,360
It's funny how people love blaming others.

118
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,640
Have you ever looked at yourself?

119
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
What kind of aunt

120
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,840
lets her pregnant niece work until late

121
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,520
and waste away?

122
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,880
You stayed in the same house.
Why didn't you tell her?

123
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
What?

124
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,320
You were probably
too busy speculating land,

125
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,360
buying lottery numbers, right?
You had no time to care for her.

126
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,560
These are for Duangporn,

127
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,920
before she ends up miscarrying too,
with no one looking after her.

128
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,560
Do you want some?

129
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
How many months are you?

130
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm chubby, not pregnant!

131
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,720
Ugh, Mei! That witch!
Where the hell did she dig all that up?

132
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,320
I didn't even have a chance to react.

133
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,200
Here he is, sir.

134
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
This is Mr. Ronnakorn Trongpanich.

135
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
Pleasure to meet you.

136
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,640
Likewise.

137
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,520
Would you mind
sitting down for a quick chat?

138
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,000
- Of course.
- Please.

139
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
Ladies, give them some space.

140
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,120
You have a strong presence
and a charming face.

141
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,720
You'll go far, I'm sure.

142
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,200
Thank you.

143
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,200
Have you considered a political career?

144
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,080
Excuse me?

145
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,320
Well, please excuse me.
I'll leave you two to talk.

146
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Our party

147
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,720
is looking for fresh local faces,

148
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,280
young, educated,

149
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,200
from well-known families,

150
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,440
and most importantly,
never having been in politics.

151
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,320
You fit every criterion.

152
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not much of a talker.
I don't think I could handle it.

153
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,320
Don't worry.

154
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
With me backing you, it's a done deal.

155
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,240
Are you feeling better?

156
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,800
You don't need to stand all day.

157
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,560
You've got staff now. They can do it.

158
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
Just sit and rake in the money.

159
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,280
I can't do that.

160
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,880
It's a new store. I want
to make a good impression,

161
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,040
so customers return.

162
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,880
Think about my baby too.

163
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,160
Only your baby?

164
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,800
Hello?

165
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,840
I'm still up, Mom.

166
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,280
How's Duangporn?

167
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,480
Don't let her overwork, okay?

168
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,800
She needs a lot of rest.

169
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
You know,

170
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,760
Ranee just miscarried.

171
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,760
It's because of all that overworking.

172
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,720
Rak,

173
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,760
I've made up my mind.

174
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm moving to Bangkok to live with you.

175
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,400
I thought I had escaped.

176
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,160
What now?
I've got to live with your mom again?

177
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,880
For how long?

178
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,079
Don't say until I give birth.

179
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,079
I guess that's the idea.

180
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Are you kidding me?

181
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,119
Be careful!

182
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,400
This won't cause a miscarriage.

183
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,319
Stressing out over your mom will.

184
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,880
When will you stop
letting her run your life?

185
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,760
You're not a child anymore.

186
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,320
Next time, talk to me first.

187
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
You're not alone anymore.

188
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,640
Look.

189
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,720
Consider the upside.

190
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
Having her here helps us.

191
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,400
Trust me.
She'll pay for all baby expenses.

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,760
When the baby's born,
she'll be obsessed with her grandchild.

193
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,040
She'll give anything we ask.

194
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,320
And she hates owing favors.

195
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,120
She'll cover everything.

196
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,160
That takes a load off our shoulders.

197
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,080
Think of it as free childcare.

198
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
We'll get to go out

199
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
and enjoy life again.

200
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,160
My dear Rak really loves his mother.

201
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
So sweet.

202
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
He's about to be a father

203
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,640
and still wants his mom to live with him.

204
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,120
I'm glad

205
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,760
I thought of him.

206
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,040
Are you really leaving, ma'am?

207
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,520
You won't stop talking?

208
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,240
At the end of every month,

209
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm coming back to settle the books.

210
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm not disappearing for good.

211
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,200
I'll miss you so much, ma'am.

212
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
Watch over the house for me,

213
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,360
so I won't have to worry.

214
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,560
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
It's hard to believe.

216
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,400
This house that used to be
full of chatter from morning to night…

217
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
is now so quiet.

218
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
There's no one left.

219
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,960
Take good care of the house.

220
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,760
Has Rawee gone to work already?

222
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Ranee…

223
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,680
My dear.

224
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,160
Are you crying again?

225
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,200
I can't leave you alone for a second.

226
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
I still can't stop feeling guilty, Auntie.

227
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,880
Oh, dear. Come on.

228
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
Don't think like that.

229
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
The child chose not to stay.

230
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
Think about it.

231
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,320
Their grandmother
on that side has a bad mouth.

232
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Their grandmother on this side
is no better.

233
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
Their dad's brothers are always fighting,

234
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,200
and their parents are buried in work.

235
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
There are so many problems.

236
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,920
It's no wonder the baby said,
"I'd rather die first!"

237
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh?

238
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Auntie…

239
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,320
That's what I really think.

240
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
My dear, think about it.

241
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,720
No baby would want
to be born into this mess.

242
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,560
It's probably a blessing for the baby.

243
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
You're right.

244
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,400
My dear.

245
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,920
You can have another child
when you're ready,

246
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,040
so they'll want to stay.

247
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,520
Yes, Auntie.

248
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,480
No more tears now, all right?

249
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,280
<i>Oh, love, why must you tease me?</i>

250
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,680
<i>You draw us close</i>

251
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,680
<i>Bind us tight</i>

252
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,520
<i>Only to cast me aside</i>

253
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,880
<i>Like none of it ever mattered</i>

254
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,080
Chome.

255
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,440
Do I look more respectable in this?

256
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,480
You look great.

257
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
I still don't know
if I should go through with this.

258
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,720
Well…

259
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,120
You'll never know unless you try.

260
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,400
But if you get elected,

261
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,800
you'll beat all your brothers.

262
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,960
No one will ever look down on you again.

263
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,480
MANAGER'S OFFICE

264
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,920
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

265
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

266
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Please have a seat.

267
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,240
Thank you.

268
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,320
Here it is.

269
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,480
How many guests have canceled so far?

270
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,560
Nearly half.

271
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,200
And we're still getting
more cancellations.

272
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,040
When did the cancellations start?

273
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,080
Yesterday afternoon.

274
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,160
That's when the competitor
announced their one-month discount.

275
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,680
Yes.

276
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,000
First, they poached our banquet clients,

277
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,760
now they're slashing room prices too.

278
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
This is too much.

279
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,960
Should we drop our prices to compete?

280
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,400
No, we can't do that.
That would ruin our standards.

281
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,720
Our room quality and pricing are fair.

282
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,360
Yes.

283
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,640
They can say they lower the prices
because they're new,

284
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,320
but that won't last.
They'll have to raise them soon.

285
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,160
We just have to hold on for now.

286
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,000
Understood.

287
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
What's he doing here?

288
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Here it is.

289
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,360
Is it fake?

290
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,920
Yes.

291
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
Who would've thought

292
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,160
they'd scam us like this?

293
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,440
What about the ones we bought?

294
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,920
Did you bring them?

295
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

296
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
Here it is.

297
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,160
Should we get them checked
at another shop?

298
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,880
That's a good idea.

299
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,800
Shall we go now?

300
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,760
Let's go.
I don't even know if mine are fake.

301
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Let's go.

302
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Bancha's trying to get Korn into politics.

303
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Korn?

304
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,320
Probably because
of Dad and Madam Mei's name.

305
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,600
Aren't you going to warn him?

306
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,120
What for?

307
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,600
Bancha's cunning and ruthless.
Look how he's bleeding us dry.

308
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,680
He poked the hornet's nest.

309
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,000
Think about it.

310
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,200
This is all upside for us.

311
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
How so?

312
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,040
If Korn wins,

313
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,520
I can claim he's my brother with Bancha.

314
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,800
If he gets conned and loses money,

315
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,040
that's his bad luck.

316
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,000
Every man for himself.

317
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,800
Hello, Mom.

318
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,640
How are you?

319
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,760
You look healthier.

320
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,680
I gained two kilos.

321
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,400
That's good. Don't worry about weight.

322
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,760
Once the baby's out and you're nursing,

323
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,000
it'll drop fast.

324
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Yes.

325
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,600
Where are Mom's things?

326
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,920
I had Prajak
bring them in through the back.

327
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,280
Then you should rest upstairs.

328
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,000
There's staff there.
Call them if you need anything.

329
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,200
All right.

330
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,400
I'll go brew some tonic for you first.

331
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,760
Yes, Mom.

332
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,600
I'll walk you up.

333
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
No need.

334
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,400
You sell your things. I can go myself.

335
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,440
Okay, Mom.

336
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,440
What tonic? I'm not drinking it.

337
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
Then pour it out.

338
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,960
Just let her do what she wants.

339
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,080
You've been scammed.

340
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,960
These are fakes.

341
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,560
If you don't believe me,
feel free to check elsewhere.

342
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,840
Then what should we do?

343
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,680
Get our money back.

344
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,520
Don't let them get away with it.

345
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,080
Should we go now?

346
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,720
We have to go now.
They might've already fled.

347
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,040
Let's meet at the store.

348
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,400
Sure.

349
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,240
What should I do with the real ones?

350
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,240
Should I sell them off?

351
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,880
Sell it quickly

352
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,880
before this becomes news.

353
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,760
Fifty-fifty, as we agreed?

354
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,680
Deal.

355
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
Can I have the photos back?

356
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,200
Sure.

357
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,960
The replicas look so real.

358
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,040
If you want me to do more, let me know.

359
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,720
This is enough for now.

360
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,600
Just get the cash ready.

361
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,560
All right.

362
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,880
How dare you
try to trick us with fake jewelry!

363
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,400
Mine's fake too! Refund us,

364
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,520
or we'll report this to the police.

365
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,680
Please wait a moment. I believe
there must be some misunderstanding.

366
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,320
Exactly.

367
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,760
Every piece in our store
has a verified source.

368
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,680
There's no way it could be fake.

369
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,680
We just had it examined
by another jeweler.

370
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,960
It's definitely fake.

371
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,160
And it's not just us.

372
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,920
Miss Chanraem's piece
from the grand opening

373
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
was also fake.

374
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,320
We were supposed to come together,

375
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,400
but I guess she bailed on us.

376
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,960
All right.

377
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,520
Let me have the pieces rechecked.

378
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,360
If they're really fake,
I'll fully refund you.

379
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,440
Then let's go right now.

380
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,600
I don't care which shop. Just prove it.

381
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,240
That's fine. We won't let
our store's reputation be tarnished.

382
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,680
Please, this way to my car.

383
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,840
All right.

384
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
What happened?

385
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,000
Customers are claiming we sold them fakes.

386
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,760
Fakes? That's impossible.

387
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,200
I bet this has something to do
with Chanraem and her husband.

388
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,560
Those two women will handle it.
No need for us to lift a finger.

389
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,960
What should we do next?

390
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,120
Just spread the word
to a few more customers.

391
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,720
My friend's shop would never mix in fakes.

392
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,120
She's been in business
since before you were born.

393
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,840
She wouldn't risk her name
for a few bucks.

394
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,120
And my friend's shop is a family business

395
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,200
with its own factory.
I've been close with Kaew for years.

396
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
There's no way they sold us fakes.

397
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,320
Please come in.

398
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,800
Well?

399
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,240
Give them a refund.

400
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,679
Please…

401
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,480
I kindly ask both of you

402
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,800
to keep this matter quiet for now.

403
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,840
I need time to investigate
where this mistake came from.

404
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,800
Please understand us.

405
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,760
So it really was fake?

406
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Ning,

407
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,480
can you check
their receipts for the amounts?

408
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,480
Yes.

409
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,240
It's impossible.
This has to be some kind of mistake.

410
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,280
Maybe Chanraem is trying
to get back at us like you suspected.

411
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,880
It's definitely fake.

412
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,480
There are three cases so far.

413
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,840
I have your business card,
so I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

414
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,360
You might want to get your piece inspected

415
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
or just return it.

416
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,920
Yes, take care.

417
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
If it turns out to be fake,

418
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
you're welcome
to return it for a full refund.

419
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,040
Yes, we're not shutting down
or disappearing.

420
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,120
Yes. Thank you.

421
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,400
Pick it up.

422
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,480
Hello.

423
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,480
R&D Jewelry.

424
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,360
The rumors are spreading fast.
I'm worried what might come next.

425
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,520
Kaew just called.

426
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,920
She told me not to say
the goods came from her store.

427
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
Is her shop selling fakes or what,

428
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,200
talking like
she's got nothing to do with it?

429
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
No way.

430
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,760
I'm more suspicious of her friend's shop.

431
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
Be suspicious of your friend first.

432
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Stop arguing.

433
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,880
The returned pieces

434
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,880
came from both shops.

435
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,880
And what about Chanraem's set?

436
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,080
It's a mixed set from both shops.

437
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,240
That's odd.

438
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,360
If both stores sell genuine pieces,

439
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,640
how could all three sets be fake?

440
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,800
Chanraem and Tub
are definitely behind this.

441
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,440
Master!

442
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,760
More customers
are here to return their pieces.

443
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,560
This is bad.

444
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,360
If everyone returns their stuff,
we're done for.

445
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,440
This is really bad.

446
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,360
I already used
the sales revenue to restock.

447
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,640
How much cash do we have in the safe?

448
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,000
Some,

449
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,920
but if returns keep coming like this,
it won't be enough.

450
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
We sold a lot in our first week.

451
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,840
Then here's what we do.

452
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,720
If we're sure it's genuine,

453
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,480
give the refunds.

454
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,320
If you run short on cash, I'll cover it.

455
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,880
If this keeps up,
we're in serious trouble.

456
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,440
Can they really afford
to keep their prices

457
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,240
that low for long?

458
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,440
If the volume of guests
makes up for the discount,

459
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,360
then they might sustain it.
And it's affecting us hard.

460
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,640
Chen really found a way to hurt us.

461
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,920
Doesn't he care that

462
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,160
this hotel was built
by his own father's sweat and tears?

463
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,120
He's just angry at Mom.

464
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,720
All he wants is to beat her.

465
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,600
But the one suffering and stressed out

466
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,120
is you.

467
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,000
He doesn't care.

468
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,400
As long as it hurts Mom, Chen's satisfied.

469
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,280
He'll probably keep stabbing us like this
over and over.

470
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,760
I don't know what to do.

471
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,920
If we don't match their pricing,
how do we fight back?

472
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
Thank you.

473
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,960
If there's a song you want to hear,
write it down and send it over.

474
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,520
Thank you.

475
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,800
Are you giving me this or not?

476
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,760
Just come sit with me at my table.

477
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,360
I'm sorry, I can't.

478
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,520
I have to keep singing for everyone.

479
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,160
Just a minute, come on.

480
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,320
- I really can't.
- Come.

481
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,040
Sorry. I really can't.

482
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,200
You can't treat a singer like this.

483
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
What's it to you?

484
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,360
If you want to leave
this place in one piece,

485
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,680
don't mess with the singer again.

486
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,880
Come on.

487
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,080
What happened?

488
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,640
A drunk customer
tried to harass her, Master.

489
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,040
It's true. If it wasn't for Chat,
I would've been in trouble.

490
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
Glad it didn't get out of hand.

491
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,800
Thanks.

492
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,120
I'm just doing my job, sir.

493
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,560
So, how did your meeting
with Mr. Bancha go? Tell me.

494
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,960
Why didn't you call?

495
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,360
Do you know how worried we were?

496
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
I thought I'd be gone just a little while.

497
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Do you even know what time it is?

498
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,040
Why are you this drunk?

499
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,360
You stink. It's disgusting.

500
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
A friend invited me out!

501
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,720
Why are they arguing again?

502
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,720
Hey! Don't throw up in here.

503
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,200
Get out now!

504
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,560
- Get out!
- Whoa!

505
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,360
I'm not going. This is my room.
I'm sleeping here.

506
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,360
You can't sleep here. You stink. Get out.

507
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,560
Is that women's perfume?

508
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,240
You went to a brothel, didn't you?

509
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,800
- Right?!
- No!

510
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,880
Of course you did.

511
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,320
That's not my perfume!

512
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,920
You went to a brothel, didn't you?

513
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,640
I said no!

514
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,920
She just poured drinks.

515
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,680
Did she have to straddle you to pour them?

516
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,120
Why does it reek of perfume?

517
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,600
Get out of the room!

518
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,880
- Get out!
- What?

519
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,080
- You're disgusting!
- Whoa!

520
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,240
Get out!

521
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,160
Get out.

522
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,440
- It hurts.
- Get out.

523
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,920
I don't even want to see your face.

524
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
- Get lost.
- I'm not going!

525
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,080
I was stupid to marry you.

526
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,960
Didn't finish school
because you were busy at brothels.

527
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,560
Then you got the maid pregnant!

528
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,680
Duangporn, why bring that up?

529
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,120
Because your son is scum! That's why!

530
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,720
When will you shut up?!

531
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,680
I said I didn't go to a brothel!

532
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,840
Are you deaf?!

533
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,720
- Stop!
- That hurts!

534
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,080
Mom!

535
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,280
Mom. Mom.

536
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,640
Mom. Mom.

537
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,560
Mom moved to Bangkok to stay with Rak?

538
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,240
Why?

539
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,720
She was worried about Ms. Duangporn.

540
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,760
She was afraid she might miscarry too,
so she went to help take care of her.

541
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,560
That's fair.

542
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,400
New parents living alone in Bangkok,

543
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,400
having Mom there is probably good.

544
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,400
But now it's hard to tell
who's taking care of whom.

545
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,320
Madam fell down the stairs.

546
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,440
What?

547
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,000
She's getting discharged today.

548
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,600
How's Mom?

549
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,360
She's safe now.

550
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,040
She'll need some time to rest and recover.

551
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,320
Ngor said she's being discharged today.

552
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,320
Is she coming back home?

553
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,120
No. She's staying with Rak.

554
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,840
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

555
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,040
Do you want to go visit her in Bangkok?

556
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,360
If she's fine now, then no need.

557
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,920
She might think you're being cold-hearted.

558
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,480
She'll probably get irritated
just seeing my face.

559
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,160
Might even throw me out.

560
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,360
Don't think that way.

561
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,960
I can't help it.

562
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,600
I don't want to hear her yell at me like,

563
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,280
"I'm not dead yet.
Don't even think about my inheritance."

564
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,320
I just don't want to get hurt anymore.

565
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,360
Then I'll go visit her on your behalf.

566
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,040
If she yells, I'll pretend not to hear.

567
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,640
Fine, suit yourself.

568
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,840
I've got a meeting
with the marketing team.

569
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,840
We need to figure out
how to bring customers back in.

570
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,960
If we leave it like this,

571
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,240
the hotel's going to die.

572
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
I'm not going to visit her.

573
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,000
She's already with her beloved son.

574
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,280
Let them care for each other.

575
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,680
But people at the market said
she was badly hurt.

576
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,800
Whether I go or not makes no difference.

577
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,720
She'd probably recover faster
seeing her favorite son.

578
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,000
Still, you should at least show your face.

579
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,760
She's got a lot of inheritance.

580
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Don't get your hopes up.

581
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,800
Rak's probably already taken most of it.

582
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,200
Idiot. It's because you don't know
how please others,

583
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,000
that's why you never get anything.

584
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,680
Useless.

585
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,000
She's tough to kill, huh?

586
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,120
Guess her sins are too deep to die easily.

587
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,440
Dying would be too easy.
That woman deserves to live crippled

588
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,440
and suffer for the rest of her life.

589
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,960
I'm not eating!

590
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,400
Get out. If I don't call you, don't come.

591
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,760
Tell your master

592
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,720
to get Ngor here to take care of me.

593
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,680
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get out!

594
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,400
- Get out!
- Yes, ma'am.

595
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,520
Sir! Sir!

596
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,000
I can't take care of Madam anymore.

597
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,680
I'm quitting.

598
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,800
Wait, calm down.
What happened? Let's talk.

599
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,600
She's mean, and she has a nasty temper.

600
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,240
I've never worked for anyone like her.

601
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,800
I'm scared.

602
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,080
How about this?

603
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,920
Just stick to your housework.
You don't have to take care of Mom.

604
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,200
Really?

605
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,520
With Mom lashing out like this,
only Ngor can handle her.

606
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,200
I'm not going to do it either.

607
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,080
I'm pregnant
and barely holding on as it is.

608
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,200
I can't deal
with an old woman with a temper.

609
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,600
Is she here to help or to burden us?

610
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,880
Why are you saying that?

611
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,720
Am I wrong?

612
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,360
Mom promised

613
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,360
she'd invest more in our shop.

614
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Then if no one can handle her,
hire a nurse.

615
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,680
I guess so.

616
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,360
Hello. Welcome.

617
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,160
She's in here.

618
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,920
Are you sure you can handle Mom's temper?

619
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,880
I'll try.

620
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,880
You have enough stress running the shop.

621
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,320
Let me take care of Mom.

622
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,800
I'm not asking out of concern.
If you can manage it,

623
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,960
we won't have to pay for a nurse.

624
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,120
Now that's more like the Duangporn I know.

625
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,960
I said if I don't call, don't come in!

626
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,560
Don't you understand?

627
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,760
Good afternoon.

628
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,680
What are you doing here?

629
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,880
I heard about your accident,
so I came to visit.

630
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,480
Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not dead yet.

631
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,320
Don't count on my inheritance.

632
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,800
Why do you always turn people's goodwill
into something about money?

633
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,360
Why don't you ask your aunt?
She might have a better answer than I do.

634
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,880
Where's Ngor?

635
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,040
I came alone.

636
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,840
Useless.

637
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,800
Ngor's sick.
She has the flu and is coughing.

638
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,080
She has no energy
to take care of you right now.

639
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,360
So I'll take care of you for now,
in Ngor's place.

640
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,840
You? Taking care of me?

641
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,400
Yes.

642
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,080
The maid wants to quit.

643
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,440
The nurse probably won't last long.

644
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,280
So I'm the only one
who can handle your temperament.

645
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,840
Get out. Go back home!

646
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,960
I can't.

647
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,320
I have a duty to fulfill
as a good daughter-in-law.

648
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,560
If I don't, the neighbors will gossip

649
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,760
that your children abandoned you
when you were hurt.

650
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,400
If you decide to work with us,

651
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,600
there'll be quite a few things to fix
before you enter the public eye.

652
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,640
Like what, exactly?

653
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,360
The public image.

654
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,920
You need to look better,

655
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,600
professionally and personally.

656
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,520
You run a bar,

657
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,880
and your wife is the bar singer.

658
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,080
That raises questions,

659
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,920
and competitors
might use that against you.

660
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
May I ask,

661
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,520
are you legally married?

662
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
No.

663
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,160
I also heard your family disapproves

664
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,160
of your job and your relationship.

665
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,000
You've done your homework.

666
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,440
Of course, I'm a professional.

667
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,480
The job itself isn't hard.

668
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,640
Your family has
a strong business foundation.

669
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,080
But I recommend cutting ties
with your current woman

670
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,720
and marrying someone

671
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,600
who can help win votes.

672
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,280
Where has it gone?

673
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,440
My wife's got real skills.

674
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,240
I suspect Master Rak is trying
to squeeze more money from Madam again.

675
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,600
<i>How much do you want?</i>

676
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,840
I'm not spending your money.
I just want to help safeguard it

677
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,640
before it all gets blown.

678
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,320
Hey, Korn, watch your mouth.

679
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,560
Die now!

680
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,760
