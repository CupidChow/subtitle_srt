1
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
Why are you in such a rush?
Stay and talk for a bit.

2
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
Why would you embezzle
from your own hotel?

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,160
You're back late.

4
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,120
<i>Now I've got a way</i>
<i>to get back at Duangporn.</i>

5
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,759
<i>She looked down on me.</i>

6
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,600
Mei started this war.

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,040
She doesn't deserve to be happy.

8
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,200
Old flames are about to reignite.

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
Who are you talking about?

10
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,040
Your husband.

11
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,840
Mr. Rak and I used to be in love, right?

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Rak? Mr. Rak?

13
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Don't say I'm nosy,

14
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
but I think you should
pay more attention to your wife.

15
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,280
Did Chan cause any trouble?

16
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
Honestly, it's been a long time.

17
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,840
They've both moved on
and found someone new.

18
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
But well…

19
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,320
old habits die hard.

20
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't get what you're trying to say.

21
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,680
Mr. Rak.

22
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
What did you see?

23
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,160
Chanraem and Rak

24
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,880
secretly met at night.
I saw it with my own eyes.

25
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,480
They even hugged.

26
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
Mr. Rak.

27
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,080
Duangporn?

28
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,280
Are you trying to steal my husband?

29
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,240
How dare you! So ambitious!

30
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,200
You brat!

31
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,240
Chan?

32
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,720
Hey!

33
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,560
Let go of me! Help! Let go!

34
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,960
Chan, let go of her.

35
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,920
- That's my wife!
- Let go!

36
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,560
Why did you try to poison me
and kill my child?

37
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,400
- I didn't do it.
- Why did you kill my child?

38
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,520
- Chan!
- Let go of me.

39
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,480
My child… My child is dead.

40
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,560
My child is dead!

41
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,360
Are you all right?

42
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,800
Let's go downstairs first.

43
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm not going.

44
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm not going. My husband's here.

45
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Chan, you remember now?

46
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Big Sister-in-Law?

47
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,200
You've already given birth?

48
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Given birth?

49
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,000
You're the one who poisoned me
until I miscarried. Don't you remember?

50
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,200
Chan? Chan?

51
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,080
My child.

52
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,720
My child is dead.

53
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,120
My child is dead.

54
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,600
My child is dead.

55
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Our child is dead.

56
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
Our child is dead.

57
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Our child is dead.

58
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,600
This is getting out of hand.
Let's go home.

59
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,600
Let go! I'm not going! Let me go!

60
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not going! Let me go!

61
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,880
We need to talk.

62
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,360
Duangporn…

63
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,160
What happened? What was that shouting?

64
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Dad…

65
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,440
Ask your son yourself.

66
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
It's too disgusting to say.

67
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,560
I'll explain later.

68
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,480
Dad, are you all right?

69
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,559
You look so pale.

70
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,919
I must've stood up too fast.

71
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,600
The argument must've disturbed your rest.

72
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,520
It's all right.

73
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
You were in the room too, weren't you?

74
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,680
Tell me what happened.

75
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,080
Of course, Dad.

76
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,640
Thanks again, Bro.

77
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,680
That's the hundredth thank-you already.

78
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,720
We're brothers.

79
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,560
If I don't help you, who will?

80
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,320
I wonder if Chome's back yet.
She wouldn't let me go with her.

81
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,280
She probably felt bad.

82
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,400
Maybe she wanted some time at the temple.

83
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,160
I think she's deeply upset,
like she hurt her own brother for a man.

84
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,360
Still, her brother went too far.

85
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Let go of me!

86
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,320
Let go of me! I'm not going!

87
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,760
Let go of me!

88
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,040
Let go of me now! I'm not going!

89
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm a daughter-in-law of this house!
Let me go!

90
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,920
You're having another episode.

91
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,360
That was a long time ago. I was young.

92
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,360
I couldn't control my emotions.

93
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
And what about today?

94
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,080
If I'd walked in a second later,
what would've happened?

95
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,040
Nothing would've happened.
I wasn't the one who started it.

96
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,480
I don't believe you.

97
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,960
If a woman offers herself,
every man gives in.

98
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,000
You're underestimating me.

99
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,960
Chanraem's just a driver's wife.

100
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,600
So if she were a maid

101
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,360
without a husband, you'd sleep with her?

102
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
Talking to you is impossible.

103
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Then don't talk.

104
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,320
Let go! Let me go right now! Let go!

105
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
Let go of me!

106
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,120
Young Masters!

107
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,960
Young Masters, help me!

108
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Young Masters, help me!

109
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Chan, go back with me now.

110
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm your husband.

111
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,600
No, you're not!

112
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,120
- Chan, go with me.
- Young Masters! Mr. Rak! Help me.

113
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Help me. Young Masters, help me!

114
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
Prajak, honk the horn.

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
What's going on here?

116
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,480
If she's still this hysterical,

117
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,640
she can't stay in my house.

118
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,200
Send her to the mental hospital.

119
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
This doesn't concern you. Go inside.

120
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,000
Go now.

121
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
Get me some hot tea.

122
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Yes, Dad.

123
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,720
Sorry. I said I'm sorry.
What more do you want?

124
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,360
I can't sleep
in the same bed with you anymore.

125
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,160
You're filthy. Disgusting!

126
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,440
Duangporn,

127
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,880
calm down.

128
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,240
Come sit and talk.

129
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
There's nothing to talk about!

130
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,440
You all lied to me.

131
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,120
I was just a tool
to polish your son's image.

132
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,080
- But a lowly nature isn't so easily fixed.
- That's too much!

133
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,600
I've taken your insults all along.

134
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,840
I know I'm at fault,
and I've tried to become a better husband.

135
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,120
Have you ever tried to improve?

136
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,760
Why should I improve?

137
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,040
So you think you've been
the perfect daughter-in-law?

138
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Sleeping in late,
I've always had to cover for you.

139
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,960
And all the work Mom assigned to you,
have you ever done it yourself?

140
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,360
You just dumped it on others
and used my money to pay them.

141
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,280
What a waste of your degree.

142
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Did you even graduate on your own,
or did you pay someone to take the exams?

143
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,680
If I'm so bad, why did you marry me?

144
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,160
How was I supposed to know
you were such a good actress?

145
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
I thought you were flawless like Ranee.
I was a fool to choose you.

146
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,320
If I'm not good enough for you,
then let's get divorced!

147
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,600
- You're the one who said it!
- Yes!

148
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,800
Take your wife back to the stables.

149
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,600
I don't want to see her here again.

150
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,840
Everything's over.

151
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,960
Don't let this issue return
and cause more problems.

152
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,160
This isn't over.

153
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,160
You and Rak haven't paid
for what you've done.

154
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,360
All right. Enough.

155
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,960
I've listened to you
shout over my head long enough.

156
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,640
If you want to go home, go for now.

157
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
You're both still full of anger.

158
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,440
If you keep facing each other,
it'll just get worse.

159
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,120
No one's going anywhere.

160
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
Duangporn, if you still respect me,

161
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,840
go calm yourself down in your room.

162
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,960
I'll handle this.

163
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,760
Yes, Mom.

164
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,840
Rak.

165
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,000
Come talk with me in the room.

166
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,080
This is all your wife's fault.

167
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,960
So haughty and entitled.

168
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,880
She needed her servants around.

169
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,680
Now look what happened.

170
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,800
But you agreed to it yourself.

171
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,040
Are you blaming me?

172
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,880
I agreed because of you,

173
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,680
to avoid trouble
between you and your wife.

174
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,960
So I'm the villain,

175
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,680
and your high and mighty wife

176
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,480
is the angel?

177
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,600
- Mom.
- Stop!

178
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,920
Don't say anything.

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
Save yourself first.

180
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,040
Go call Ranee to see me.

181
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,120
Why did you have to compare me to her?

182
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,400
Don't tell me

183
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,920
all three brothers are into Ranee?

184
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,960
You and I clearly can't live
under the same roof anymore.

185
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,800
Don't make the same mistake twice, Rak.

186
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,560
You may not be so lucky like last time.

187
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,120
Duangporn overreacted.

188
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,840
I happened to catch Chan
sneaking into my room.

189
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,120
Enough! Enough.

190
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
You know the truth yourself.

191
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,600
Remember this, Rak.

192
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,320
From now on, before you do anything,

193
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,800
think three times.

194
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,800
The more you think, the more cautious

195
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,640
and rational you'll become.

196
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,520
You won't act recklessly again.

197
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,640
Can you promise me that?

198
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,280
Yes, Dad.

199
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,319
All right.

200
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,600
So she kicked you and your wife out?

201
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,640
Yes.

202
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,200
But Young Miss still has Cha-aim with her.

203
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,120
She'll be fine.

204
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,640
I was pregnant
with Mr. Rak's child, wasn't I, Tub?

205
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,520
I lost the baby, didn't I?

206
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,400
Why did he abandon me
to marry someone else?

207
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,200
Why, Tub?

208
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,320
If you remember that much,

209
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,480
then I'll tell you the whole truth.

210
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,320
After you hear this,
whatever you choose to do

211
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
is up to you.

212
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,000
You're here finally.

213
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,000
I suppose you've realized by now

214
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,320
how all your drama
has stirred up this mess.

215
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,560
I didn't think them living their lives
would lead to anything like this.

216
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,440
You sure are good
at shirking responsibility.

217
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
It's not fair to just blame Ranee.

218
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,560
None of this would've happened
if Rak hadn't done that with Chanraem.

219
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,840
Hey?

220
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,560
Are you defending your wife
by blaming me now?

221
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
- Am I wrong though?
- Wee!

222
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,200
You really believe Tub over me?

223
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
And isn't Duangporn in tears right now

224
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
because she caught you and Chan

225
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
doing something in the room?

226
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
It's not your business. Stay out of it.

227
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,040
Worry about your own problems
with your nightclub singer wife.

228
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,840
Watch it, Bro.

229
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,600
My wife's a singer,

230
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,400
not like the girls in the brothel
you caught gonorrhea from

231
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,720
and got expelled from school for.

232
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,240
You bastard!

233
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
- Stop.
- Stop!

234
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,280
- No.
- Stop!

235
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,480
No, stop.

236
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,720
I said stop!

237
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
I'm right here,

238
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
and you're still fighting?

239
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Korn, apologize to your brother now.

240
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm just speaking the truth.

241
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,160
Mom, stop blindly siding
with Rak all the time.

242
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,440
Korn!

243
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,680
Easy for you to talk. Dad spoils you too!

244
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,160
This old man's not going to last long.

245
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,600
I'd better act fast
before I'm left with nothing.

246
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,040
Don't think I don't know
Dad's been slipping you cash.

247
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,880
Just like how Mom
stuffs envelopes in the car for you.

248
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,680
That's not the same.
I help Mom with errands,

249
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,800
collecting rent, driving around.

250
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,920
She pays me wages and fuel money.
What's wrong with that?

251
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
But Dad gives you money

252
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,360
because you're broke
and your wife is pathetic.

253
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
No, Korn.

254
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,360
Break it up now!

255
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,760
- No, stop.
- You're fighting like dogs!

256
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,000
That's enough, both of you.

257
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,640
You want to make Dad
worry himself to death?

258
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Stop.

259
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,240
You see this?

260
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,000
They never fought before.
This is all your fault.

261
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,520
I already told Tub and Chanraem
not to come here again.

262
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
Just now? Isn't it a little late?

263
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,200
My sons never fought before.

264
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,720
You are the cause of this.

265
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,400
You only ever blame Ranee.

266
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,680
It's natural for her aunt to worry.

267
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,320
If it were Rak or Korn
moving into their in-laws' house,

268
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,280
I bet you and Dad
would send a full staff to wait on them,

269
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,880
maybe even a private investigator.

270
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,560
Oh, wow, so protective.

271
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
What a precious wife.

272
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,000
She's untouchable, huh?

273
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,320
Because she's not wrong!

274
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,720
- You're protecting--
- That's enough, Rawee.

275
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So now you're saying it's my fault?

276
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,680
You know yourself.

277
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,680
Korn!

278
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,480
Hey, stop now.

279
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,440
This arguing solves nothing.

280
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,880
Don't let this happen again.

281
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,560
I won't tolerate it anymore.

282
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,080
Duangporn, wait.

283
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,360
They've made up.

284
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,840
The rest of you can go too. Get out!

285
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's go, Rawee.

286
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
Rawee.

287
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,880
None of my daughters-in-law

288
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,560
have turned out right.

289
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,640
All Moon Festival offerings
must be vegetarian.

290
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,280
Otherwise, someone ignorant

291
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,080
might try to show off

292
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,200
with some awful dish
and ruin the whole event.

293
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,400
Seems like there's only one here.

294
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,640
If you want to be part of this family,
you follow our customs.

295
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,800
We have seven or eight festivals a year.

296
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,040
Even if it's uncomfortable, suck it up.

297
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,560
I think the discomfort
comes more from people than the customs.

298
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,360
What a mouth you've got.

299
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,160
I asked you to help

300
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,160
for the sake of harmony,

301
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,600
and here you are making trouble.
Can't you just let minor things slide?

302
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,600
The listener doesn't need to ignore things

303
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,960
if the speaker knows
how to think before talking.

304
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,320
You're just too argumentative.
Always have to get the last word.

305
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,520
And how's that task I gave you going?

306
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,600
- What task?
- Huh?

307
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,040
About Korn's wife.
When will she get out of my house?

308
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,120
That's not easy, Mom.

309
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,440
It'll take time,
and we have to wait for the right moment.

310
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,880
What if I add a land plot to the reward?

311
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
Will that speed things up?

312
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,360
I'll go check on her.

313
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,920
With that reaction,
do you think she's pregnant, Madam?

314
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,920
You go and find out. Report back to me.

315
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,280
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,160
Fan it harder!

317
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,920
- Yes, Auntie!
- Come on. Add more charcoal.

318
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,120
What's wrong, Ranee?

319
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,600
Come, let's go this way.

320
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
What is she up to?

321
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
Korn!

322
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,720
Come help Ranee! Rawee's not back yet!

323
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,680
What happened to Ranee?

324
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,680
She suddenly fainted.
I couldn't get her upstairs by myself.

325
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,600
- Where is she?
- Follow me.

326
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
Hurry up, Korn.

327
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.

328
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,760
I don't feel good.

329
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,840
Rawee's also not home.

330
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,040
I need you to go in
and break things up, just in case.

331
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,640
What are you talking about?

332
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,720
Korn?

333
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
Sit up slowly.

334
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,720
What happened to me?

335
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,920
You fainted.

336
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,800
Duangporn couldn't get you upstairs,
so she asked me to help.

337
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,920
Where is she now?

338
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,200
Ronnakorn used to be in love with Ranee.

339
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,680
She was his first love.

340
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,160
They're alone in that room right now.

341
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,320
I'm really concerned.
A man and woman together like that…

342
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,720
It could be scandalous.

343
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,160
That's why I--

344
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,120
So this is her plan
to drive Chomechawee away?

345
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,520
I'm fine now.

346
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,440
You should go,

347
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,680
before someone sees and misunderstands.

348
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,240
Whoa!

349
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,520
Oh my God!

350
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,360
Oh?

351
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
It's not what you think.

352
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,000
Chome, don't be mad.

353
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,800
Even if Korn once had a thing for Ranee,

354
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,920
that's all in the past.

355
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
What are you trying to stir up?

356
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,840
Wee.

357
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
Yes?

358
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,160
You should go
check on your wife right now.

359
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,560
What happened to Ranee?

360
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
She got nauseous and fainted.

361
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,760
This sounds pretty clear to me.

362
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,880
Congratulations in advance.

363
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,640
You might be the first to become a father!

364
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,560
Let me help.

365
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
Thanks.

366
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,160
I fainted. Why didn't you call Cha-aim?

367
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,960
Why bring Korn?

368
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,520
Ranee!

369
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
Are you okay?

370
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,120
Good, you're here, Mr. Rawee.

371
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,440
Do you know that

372
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,000
Korn used to be in love with your wife?

373
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,760
Madam.

374
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,200
You have to come upstairs right now.

375
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,080
What is it?

376
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,920
My plan to kick Chomechawee out

377
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,520
is about to work.

378
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,680
Really?

379
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,120
You'd better go see for yourself.

380
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Korn and I grew up together.

381
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,680
Why wouldn't I know?

382
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,080
But I never said anything

383
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,520
because I trust Ranee.

384
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,600
And I know my brother

385
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,560
can control himself.

386
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,160
So it's true.

387
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,400
Yes.

388
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,200
We both met Ranee at the same time.

389
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,360
But he spoke up first, so I stepped back.

390
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,480
Once she chose him,

391
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,520
it was over for me. That's all there is.

392
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,920
Nothing complicated to it.

393
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,640
I like how Chome asked directly

394
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,160
and cleared things up,

395
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,520
so we don't get manipulated
into turning against each other.

396
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,040
A first love is hard to forget.
It's normal.

397
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,520
You can try asking Mr. Rak
and see if he agrees.

398
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,640
I trust you, Mr. Korn.

399
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,760
And I'll prove

400
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,800
that you chose the right person.

401
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,719
Thank you.

402
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,920
Useless. Waste of time.

403
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,199
Oh, Mom?

404
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,400
I came to find the daughters-in-law.
They've all disappeared from the kitchen.

405
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,320
I'm coming now, Mom.

406
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm coming too!

407
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,920
I'll take Ranee to the hospital.

408
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,840
We might have good news.

409
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,840
All right. Go and come back quickly.

410
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,440
Yes, Mom. Let's go.

411
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Should Chome help in the kitchen, Mom?

412
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,040
No need.

413
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,480
This job's for family only.

414
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,080
What a waste of energy today.

415
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,280
Someone also ran to Mom
and got her hopes up.

416
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,920
Some people just want to piggyback

417
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,120
without doing any of the work. Shameless.

418
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,760
I didn't expect this.

419
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,600
I thought we daughters-in-law
love one another.

420
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,240
Turns out
you turn on the others so easily.

421
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,800
I've been sick of Ranee for a long time.

422
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,320
All the men here worship her

423
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,240
like she's some angel.

424
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,160
So pretentious.

425
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,440
She acts like
she's some foreign-educated princess.

426
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,320
I don't know if she's pregnant.

427
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,520
But if she gives Dad and Madam
a grandson first,

428
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,480
she'll be the queen of the house.

429
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,920
Now I get it.

430
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
You have everything,

431
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,000
yet you chose someone like me

432
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,560
because your first love didn't work out.

433
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,280
You're just trying to rebel.

434
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
You go too far.

435
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,840
You proposed

436
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,320
without ever saying you loved me.

437
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,880
Because you still love Ranee.

438
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,280
But she married your brother.

439
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,520
Everything moved too fast

440
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,080
because you can't stand
living under the same roof with her.

441
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
It hurts you.

442
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,520
So you had to find someone to replace her.

443
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,840
Deny it. Say it's not true.
Don't just stay silent.

444
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,080
I have nothing to deny.

445
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,080
- But if you want to break up because--
- But I love you.

446
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,600
I love you.

447
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,880
And I'll make you love me

448
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,480
more than you ever loved her.

449
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
Love whoever you want.

450
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,040
But the inheritance

451
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,600
should be mine too.

452
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,640
CHAROENRUNG CINEMA

453
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,440
Thanks. You finished right on schedule.

454
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,200
I did my best.

455
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,320
I still need to finish the decorations
at one of your group's hotels

456
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
to meet the deadline.

457
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,680
My group's hotel?

458
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,440
Yes, Rungcharoen Hotel.

459
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,840
It's clearly part of your group.

460
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,600
Charoenrung, Rungcharoen.

461
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,160
That's not mine.

462
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,200
I thought it belonged to you, sir.

463
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,120
Do you know who owns it?

464
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,320
Actually, you didn't have
to come in person, Mr. Rak.

465
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,040
I do have to.
Mom told me to come by myself

466
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,800
to meet all the long-time vendors.

467
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,200
She must be preparing you
to take her place.

468
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,560
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,120
Well? Did you see him?

470
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,000
I did. I smiled at him
like you told me to.

471
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
What did he do?

472
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
He stared after me.

473
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,640
I told you he still has feelings for you.

474
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,160
Chan,

475
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,080
are you sure you want to do this?

476
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,080
I know the truth now.

477
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,120
I won't let those two get away
with what they did.

478
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,120
They'll pay for what they've done to me.

479
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,360
Congratulations, mom- and dad-to-be.

480
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,520
So she's pregnant?

481
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,080
Based on the initial test, yes.

482
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,400
Why does she always get everything?

483
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,520
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

484
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,000
If you really want a child,

485
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,920
we can adopt.

486
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,400
Raising someone else's child?

487
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,360
No thanks.

488
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,040
Then why are you so upset?

489
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,840
I just can't stand her.
Always acting so smart,

490
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,280
always preaching principles
and looking down on the rest of us.

491
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,120
Why would you care about her words?

492
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
Soon,

493
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,840
no one will dare look down on us.

494
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,920
Master Chen.

495
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,920
Yes,

496
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,160
Madam Hong?

497
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,880
You're no match for your brother.

498
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,480
You married first

499
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,720
but let Ranee get pregnant before me.

500
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,280
If Mom gets her grandson, we're done for.

501
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,080
But I haven't failed you in anything.

502
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,200
So you're blaming me now?

503
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,640
I didn't say that.

504
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,080
Of course. I'm not one of the servants

505
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
sneaking around
to make things more exciting.

506
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,360
That's why she got pregnant in one go.

507
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,080
Maybe I should stop using birth control.

508
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,240
Your mom won't let us marry anyway.

509
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,720
But she won't kick me out.

510
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,640
What do you think, Korn?

511
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,240
Korn?

512
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,000
Korn?

513
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,760
Were you even listening to me?!

514
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,160
All you do
is play that out-of-tune guitar.

515
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,600
You've never yelled at me like that.

516
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,880
What were you saying?

517
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,560
You weren't listening.

518
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,320
I said I'm going
to stop using birth control.

519
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,560
Well,

520
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,240
I don't want to be second to Ranee.

521
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,080
I want you to be proud of me too.

522
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,600
So that's what's been bothering you.

523
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,360
It's all over now.

524
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,600
Ranee has Rawee.

525
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,040
I have you.

526
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,360
I want to give you a son, Korn.

527
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,040
I don't want you
to lose to your brother in everything.

528
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,720
Thank you.

529
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,840
Then let's stop the birth control, okay?

530
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,800
Let me help.

531
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,320
I can manage.

532
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,440
But I want to help.

533
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,720
All right.

534
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,600
Okay.

535
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,200
How many kids do you think we should have?

536
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,880
We haven't even had the first one yet,
and you're already thinking about more?

537
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,840
I like planning.

538
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,920
I know.
You've always been a master planner.

539
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,320
Let me see.

540
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,480
Wow.

541
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,200
You're the most beautiful woman
in the world tonight.

542
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,760
One child is fine.

543
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,120
I may be orphaned,

544
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,040
but I've had
more than enough love from Auntie.

545
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,720
You never felt lonely?

546
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,000
No.

547
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,920
Especially not in your family.

548
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,520
This place will be full of kids.

549
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,960
Then… how about two?

550
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,400
One like me, one like you.

551
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,960
Not three. Never.

552
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,160
More than that is too much.

553
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,960
We couldn't love them all equally.
They'd feel left out.

554
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,600
You're going too far. Ask me first.
I'm the one who gets pregnant.

555
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,080
Maybe one is hard enough.

556
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,960
Let's go. They'll be waiting.

557
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,360
Let's go.

558
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,560
What are you doing?

559
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,840
I'm carrying you. It's far,
and I don't want you to be tired.

560
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,080
I'm not that fragile. Let's go.

561
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,320
Then wait a moment.

562
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,560
Please.

563
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,160
Rak, your wife's face is still sour.

564
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,760
You two haven't made up?

565
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,000
She keeps picking fights,

566
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,120
always digging up old stuff.

567
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,760
So annoying.

568
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,720
You're in the wrong, so be patient.

569
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,480
But she's overdoing it.

570
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,560
Why would she still be upset?

571
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,680
What's done is done.

572
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,440
Let bygones be bygones.

573
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,920
You can't change the past.

574
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,160
Exactly.

575
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,400
Walk slowly.

576
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,760
I heard the good news.
Congratulations to you both.

577
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,000
Thank you, Dad.

578
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,200
Don't fall behind your little brother.

579
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,680
Try harder,

580
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
so your children can be friends.

581
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,240
If they want to be born,
they'll come eventually.

582
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,760
No matter who's right,
he's still your brother.

583
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,440
Don't hold a grudge.

584
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,440
He won't even look at me, Dad.

585
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,120
And rightly so.

586
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,040
You chose your wife over your brother.

587
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,800
They finally show up.
I thought they'd be too busy.

588
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Take Ranee to get ready.

589
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,960
I need a word with Chen.

590
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,080
Yes, Dad.

591
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,720
I haven't seen you around lately.

592
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,680
I've been busy, Dad.

593
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,080
Did I do something to upset you?

594
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,600
Why would you ask that, Dad?

595
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,880
How could I dare be upset with you, Dad?

596
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,440
Everyone's here. Let's start.

597
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,560
Go get ready.

598
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,800
Korn isn't here yet? Someone, go get him.

599
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,120
No need.

600
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,440
If he doesn't know his duty,
then he doesn't need to do it.

601
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,400
I'm here.

602
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,960
Why did you bring her?

603
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,720
Come on, the Moon Festival is about unity,

604
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,440
to bring the family together.

605
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,480
Let's not argue.

606
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,360
Let's pray for prosperity.

607
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,040
- Dad!
- Dad!

608
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,440
- Dear!
- Master!

609
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,640
- Dad!
- Master!

610
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,560
- Dad!
- Lift his head up!

611
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,560
- Dad.
- Dad.

612
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,680
- Dad.
- Dad.

613
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,560
- Dad.
- Dad.

614
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,920
PLEASE KEEP QUIET
EMERGENCY ROOM

615
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,320
Can't you stay still for once?

616
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,760
I'm worried about my dad.

617
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,920
We're all worried.

618
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,640
Why is it taking so long?

619
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,320
Why weren't we allowed to go
to the hospital too? Duangporn gets to go.

620
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,200
Maybe because
she's the first daughter-in-law.

621
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,080
First or last, we're all daughters-in-law.

622
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,040
We care about Dad just the same.

623
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,360
Maybe they want us to stay home

624
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,360
in case something needs doing.

625
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,720
It's more like playing favorites.

626
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,360
If anything happens to Dad and Duangporn's
the only one who gets a share,

627
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,480
I won't stand for it.

628
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,560
Why would you say that?
Nothing has happened to him yet.

629
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,280
Just because they don't say it
doesn't mean they don't think it.

630
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,600
They're probably
calculating it in their minds.

631
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,360
And you, forget about getting anything.

632
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,440
You're not even registered,
and Madam still refuses to accept you.

633
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,760
It's no surprise you'll get nothing.

634
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,640
Well,

635
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,040
aren't you the daughter-in-law
of the illegitimate son?

636
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,520
And you?
The wife of the least favored son.

637
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,000
All three of us are in the same boat.

638
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,040
Please don't lump me in.

639
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,320
I married Rawee because I love him,
not because I want his inheritance.

640
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Excuse me.

641
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,200
Well.

642
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,440
Just say
you're from a rich family already.

643
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,520
Family of Mr. Jiw, please.

644
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,080
Yes?

645
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,800
Doctor,
his condition isn't serious, right?

646
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,440
He's normally so healthy.

647
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,000
He eats well, sleeps fine,
never skips his medication.

648
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,280
He's okay, right?

649
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,600
Please, ma'am, try to stay calm.

650
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,120
Otherwise, you might collapse too.

651
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,480
Mom.

652
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,640
Hurry up. Your husband
insists on speaking only with you.

653
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,480
How is Dad?

654
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,000
How is Dad?

655
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,080
He's safe now.

656
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,280
Okay.

657
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,440
See you later.

658
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,440
Dad will need to stay
in the hospital for observation.

659
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,040
That's a relief.

660
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,800
It's just for now.

661
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,440
My dad's relative was just like him,

662
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,920
up one moment,

663
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,080
gone the next from a sudden heart attack.

664
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,600
You'd better be prepared.

665
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,720
Such a foul mouth.

666
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,600
You think if he dies,
your husband will get a cut?

667
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,160
Keep dreaming.

668
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,520
When Dad gets home,

669
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,040
we need to be more attentive
and take care of him.

670
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,480
Whether or not
you want his inheritance doesn't matter.

671
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,760
What matters is that
your husband doesn't lose out.

672
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,480
Dad?

673
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,840
From now on, think of us as strangers.

674
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,680
"I hereby bequeath
all three of my businesses

675
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,600
to Mr. Rawee Trongpanich,

676
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,880
my son,

677
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,560
granting him full authority
over their management."

678
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,720
I object to this will!

679
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,920
- I want the hotel.
- I want the cinema.

680
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,200
I'm not giving anyone anything.

681
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,600
From now on, I am no longer your mother.

682
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,800
