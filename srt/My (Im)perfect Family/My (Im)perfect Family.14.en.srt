1
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,400
- Let go of me.
- I'm not going.

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
My husband's here.

3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,080
Send her to the mental hospital.

4
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,919
This isn't over. You and Rak
haven't paid for what you've done.

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,480
None of this would've happened
if Rak hadn't done that with Chanraem.

6
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,840
Hey? Are you defending your wife
by blaming me now?

7
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,560
- Am I wrong though?
- You bastard!

8
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
- Hey, stop.
- Stop.

9
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,200
- Dad.
- Dad.

10
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,240
- Dear.
- Dad.

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,840
Oh my God!

12
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,800
- It's not what you think.
- Ranee.

13
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
Great minds think alike.

14
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,440
But I got here first.

15
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,240
Old Market porridge. If you don't line up
at dawn, it'll be sold out for sure.

16
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Auntie Nom's porridge
from by the temple wall.

17
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,360
She's stopped selling it,
but she still makes it for special people.

18
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,000
Good thing I didn't bring porridge too.

19
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,280
After filling up on porridge, any of them,

20
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,160
he can cleanse his palate
with this fruit platter.

21
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
No competition.

22
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,480
No competition? Or no right to compete?

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,320
What's going on here?

24
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,160
Breakfast for Dad, ma'am.

25
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,000
The Master said
he hasn't had much appetite lately.

26
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
That's why I went all out
to get him a good porridge.

27
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Go in, then.
Maybe one of them will suit his taste.

28
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Yes, Mom.

29
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,280
Let her in.

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,320
Are you sure, Madam?

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,240
She's the lover of his favorite son.

32
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,000
If it helps put his mind at ease,
let her do whatever she wants.

33
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,960
Thank you, Madam.

34
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,440
Feels like just yesterday
you were tagging along behind Madam Mei,

35
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,200
and now you're grown
and taking over things for your mom.

36
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,800
Why are you selling the building?

37
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,400
My kid doesn't want me
to run the business anymore.

38
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,440
Well.

39
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Could I see the title deed?

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,680
Sure, sure. One moment.

41
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Chan?

42
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,920
Those two will never feel remorse.

43
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,120
They conspired to ruin my life.

44
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,920
They think their wealth and power

45
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,720
make them untouchable.

46
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
I can't just sit
and wait for karma to catch them.

47
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,080
Don't worry. I'll take care of it myself.

48
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't kill them.

49
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,080
I want to see them crippled.

50
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,320
That's far worse.

51
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
<i>I remember everything now,</i>

52
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,280
<i>and I finally understand.</i>

53
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,760
<i>I'm not angry at you, Mr. Rak.</i>

54
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,960
<i>I just want to see you. Alone. Just once.</i>

55
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,360
<i>Since my memory returned,</i>
<i>I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

56
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,680
<i>I miss you so much.</i>
<i>I miss the time we spent together.</i>

57
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,720
<i>I believe you haven't forgotten me either.</i>

58
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,360
<i>We may never marry,</i>
<i>but we can still find happiness together.</i>

59
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,280
<i>This will be our little secret forever.</i>

60
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,560
<i>I drew a map below. You should be able</i>
<i>to find the place easily.</i>

61
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
It's me, Tub.

62
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,040
- Where's Rak?
- He left.

63
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,360
What happened? He figured it out?

64
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,680
I don't know. He just changed his mind.

65
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,880
<i>From now on, before you do anything,</i>

66
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,080
<i>think three times.</i>

67
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
<i>Can you promise me that?</i>

68
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,040
Did you get
to take care of Master Jiw at all?

69
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,800
His daughters-in-law
are practically fighting to please him.

70
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,640
Be careful.
She might start picking on you.

71
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,880
It's true.

72
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Let people say whatever they want.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

73
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Where's Cha-aim?

74
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,600
I haven't seen her since she got back.
I wanted to ask her something.

75
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,960
You can ask me instead, Auntie.

76
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,400
Has everyone heard the good news?

77
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,320
What good news? About whom?

78
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
About everyone who loves me.

79
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
What is it?

80
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm pregnant.

81
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,080
Really? Oh, my, are you really pregnant?

82
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,000
- Yes.
- I'm so happy!

83
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, my.

84
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,960
That was fast!

85
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,240
Wow, I didn't expect
that quiet little nephew-in-law

86
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
to be so capable.

87
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,840
Yes.

88
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,640
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

89
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,120
I'm sure everyone already knows him.

90
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,000
This is Mr. Rawee, the new hotel manager.

91
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,760
He'll be taking over for me
starting next week.

92
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,880
Nice to meet you all.

93
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Let them formally introduce themselves
when you officially start.

94
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Yes.

95
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,840
I'll leave you to your meeting then.

96
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,560
Once I'm gone,
go easy on the new guy, okay?

97
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,160
Keep on with the meeting.
I'm off to check the new workplace.

98
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Yes, Manager.

99
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,480
Master Jiw's illness
really showed my kids' true colors.

100
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,200
That's right.
Mr. Rak and Mr. Korn are the sweetest.

101
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,120
Whenever they have time,
they always check on him.

102
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
Not like Rawee and his wife.

103
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,240
They disappear.
Who knows what they're so busy with.

104
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,560
They barely show up.

105
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,160
Mom, has Mr. Rak come back yet?

106
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,000
Not yet. Why?

107
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,240
Dad wants to see each child one by one.

108
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
Is Master Jiw getting worse?

109
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,600
No, he's fine.

110
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,600
He probably just wants
to speak to them privately.

111
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Mr. Rak. Where have you been?
You took forever to come back.

112
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,000
What is it?

113
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,040
Dad's been asking for you
for over an hour. Go see him now.

114
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,960
There's no one else at home.

115
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,080
Where's Mom?

116
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,240
She and Ngor went
to collect rent at the market.

117
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Just go.

118
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,680
Whatever he gives you,
big or small, take it.

119
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,560
Hurry. Go now.

120
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,200
Go.

121
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,280
Dad?

122
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,920
Dad?

123
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,520
Where did he go?

124
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,200
Hey, is it still possible
to change the curtains?

125
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,760
Dad.

126
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,520
I asked them to arrange this.

127
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
How could you do this to me?

128
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,400
I…

129
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,840
I caught you red-handed. Don't deny it.

130
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,119
There are so many businesses
you could've taken.

131
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,720
Why start a hotel

132
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,680
to compete with me?

133
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,400
You hate Mei,
but your actions are hurting my business.

134
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,720
‪This is nothing.

135
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,960
This small project
won't take down your hotel.

136
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,560
Is that really all you can see?

137
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,160
Sure, my hotel won't go under.

138
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,440
But now, siblings will be rivals.

139
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,040
How will you look each other in the eye?

140
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,360
Do we even look each other in the eye now?

141
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm disappointed in you.

142
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,080
Why not do

143
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,400
silk and jade instead, Chen?

144
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,680
Do you think Madam
will ever make peace with me?

145
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,280
She'll hate me until the day she dies.

146
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,480
So you've chosen to be the enemy

147
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
of this family?

148
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,320
I have no choice.

149
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
Then from this moment on…

150
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,120
we're done.

151
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,480
That was fast.

152
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
What did he say?

153
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,320
Say what? He wasn't in the room.

154
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
What do you mean?

155
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,000
He was just talking to me before I left.

156
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,920
He really wasn't there, Mom.

157
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
How were you watching him?

158
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,160
I only went to shower for a bit.

159
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,920
Maybe he went out…

160
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,240
- Ngor.
- Yes?

161
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,480
- Go ask the staff if they saw anything.
- Yes, ma'am.

162
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
I saw Prajak drive him out.

163
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,320
Do you know where they went?

164
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,040
Korn. Korn!

165
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,360
Chome? What are you doing here?

166
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
I came to get you. Hurry.

167
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,280
Why?

168
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,880
Your dad's calling. I think he's
about to make final arrangements.

169
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,920
Don't talk nonsense!

170
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,920
Come on. You'll miss your chance. Hurry.

171
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,840
I'll give you one more chance.

172
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
Cancel this hotel project.

173
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,880
You make it sound so easy.
I've already poured everything into this.

174
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,920
You had no trouble embezzling

175
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,760
from my hotel and rice mill.

176
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,320
Rawee told you, didn't he?

177
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,880
You've got spies in my hotel.

178
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,920
Why shouldn't I have some of my own?

179
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,400
I've stepped back,

180
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,240
but I haven't let my guard down.

181
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,880
So what's your answer?

182
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm the largest shareholder here.

183
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
If I abandon this,

184
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,800
will I get to own your hotel?

185
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
I'll change my will.

186
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,480
I'll give you the rice mill.

187
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,800
I don't want the rice mill.

188
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,760
I want to own a hotel.

189
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,080
And I'll make this hotel bigger

190
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,920
and more famous than Charoenrung,

191
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,520
the one you'll give to your son.

192
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,760
If that's what you want,

193
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,560
then from now on,
think of us as strangers.

194
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
I will not consider someone

195
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,200
who betrays his own family as my son!

196
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,480
You'll see! One day,
Madam will come crawling back to beg me.

197
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,160
Your whole family will fall apart
because of Madam Mei's narrow mind.

198
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,160
Master Jiw! Watch out!

199
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,280
Master!

200
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Master! Sir!

201
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,240
- Cha-aim.
- Oh?

202
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,280
Young Miss…

203
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,000
Why so jumpy?

204
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,080
Did you do something wrong?

205
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,920
I'm really scared, miss.

206
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
What happened?

207
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,080
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>I went for a walk near the stables.</i>

208
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,320
<i>I saw Tub loading a gun,</i>

209
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,840
<i>and he left quickly.</i>

210
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,280
<i>I was suspicious</i>
<i>and decided to follow him.</i>

211
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
<i>Tub was hiding</i>
<i>in the deserted house by the field,</i>

212
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,560
<i>like he was waiting for someone.</i>

213
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,680
Are you sure it was Mr. Rak?

214
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,800
Yes, the clothes, the car,
there's no way it was anyone else.

215
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,200
But luckily,
Mr. Rak changed his mind and left.

216
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,360
Then we must warn Rawee
to tell Rak to be cautious.

217
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,600
Tub and Chanraem
are likely planning revenge.

218
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,560
Should we tell Madam?

219
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm afraid they'd get fired.

220
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,360
Then we wouldn't know anything.

221
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,640
Let's move you back here

222
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,400
to keep an eye on both of them
and report to me.

223
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
Okay.

224
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,040
Ranee.

225
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes, Auntie?

226
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,840
What is it?

227
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Rawee called.
He said to go to the hospital right away.

228
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,440
Who's hurt?

229
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,600
Master Jiw fell down the stairs.

230
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,960
Dear…

231
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,720
How could
our children and I live from now on?

232
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,240
Why are you here?

233
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,760
What the hell are you doing here,
you murderer?!

234
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,320
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

235
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,360
Why did you even come?!

236
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,520
I didn't do anything.
Dad fell down the stairs himself.

237
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,080
I don't believe you!

238
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,600
You pushed him, didn't you?

239
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,320
Rak! Call the police right now!
Have him arrested!

240
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,080
Get out!

241
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,360
Madam, Mr. Chen and I
just came back from the police station.

242
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,280
Mr. Chen didn't hurt Master Jiw.
I was there when it happened.

243
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,800
Master Jiw! Watch out!

244
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,720
Master!

245
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,040
Master! Sir!

246
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,520
Dad!

247
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,920
Master Jiw lost consciousness
and fell before Mr. Chen came out.

248
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,240
No way!

249
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,320
Why did you take him to the rival hotel?

250
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,240
He's a murderer!

251
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,040
You ungrateful bastard!

252
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,000
Dad!

253
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Dad…

254
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,320
Dad…

255
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,240
Someone, please help my dad.

256
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,600
Mom… Dad…

257
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,400
Anyone, please help my dad.

258
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,120
Dad, talk to me.

259
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,320
Talk to me, Dad.

260
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,000
Rak, help Dad, please.

261
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,720
Rak.

262
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,920
Let's go now, dear.

263
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,680
Let's go.

264
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Dad…

265
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,760
I'm sorry.

266
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,040
I didn't take good care of you.

267
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,120
I wasn't a good son to you.

268
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,480
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

269
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,440
Come in.

270
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
Where's Ranee?

271
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,040
- She's on her way, Dad.
- Come sit here.

272
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,600
Okay.

273
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,440
How are you feeling today?

274
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,400
Bored.

275
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,600
I used to work every day.
Now I'm stuck in bed.

276
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,840
I get it, Dad.
It must be hard in the beginning.

277
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,520
But you mustn't overwork anymore.

278
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,280
Let us kids take over now.

279
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,760
Did I ever tell you

280
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,760
that I'm so proud of you, Rawee?

281
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,880
You're saying it straight.
It makes me shy, Dad.

282
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,560
I mean it.

283
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,920
You've been a good boy your whole life.

284
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,760
Smart, disciplined,

285
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,880
never gave me any trouble.

286
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,880
Maybe because I never worried about you,

287
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
I started neglecting you

288
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,920
and focused on Rak and Korn.

289
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,400
If I ever made you feel overlooked,

290
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,760
I'm sorry.

291
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm sure that once I'm gone,

292
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,200
you'll do just fine.

293
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Dad…

294
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,920
don't say that.

295
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,040
You have to stay with me
and keep guiding me.

296
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,280
Do you remember
what I always tell you on your birthday?

297
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
I remember every word, Dad.

298
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,360
"No one gets fat
from just one bite of food."

299
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,480
Success doesn't come in a blink.

300
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,480
It takes patience and persistence.

301
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,920
Don't give up easily, Son.

302
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,200
Yes, Dad.

303
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
Did I ever tell you…

304
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,840
I love you the most?

305
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,040
That must be Ranee.

306
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,960
‪Yes.

307
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,840
Dad's no longer with us…

308
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,000
SOUL RETURNED TO PARADISE

309
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,800
You shouldn't have taken
the easy way out and left me.

310
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,280
How am I supposed to go on?

311
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,960
We should've parted on better terms.

312
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,400
I shouldn't have said those things to you.

313
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,480
Dear.

314
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,520
What are you going to tell the kids?

315
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,159
Many things.

316
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,080
Including the will?

317
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,000
I hope you're not going to talk to Chen.

318
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,679
No, I'm not.

319
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,960
Good.

320
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,280
Since you're talking to each of them,

321
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,440
I want you to discuss the hotel too.

322
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,679
How so?

323
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,800
Cancel the order to let Rawee manage it.

324
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,679
Give it to Rak instead.

325
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,360
I can't do that.

326
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,320
Why not? It's your hotel.

327
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,680
I, for one,

328
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,120
can't stand watching Rawee
overshadow his older brother.

329
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,120
And what about Rak?

330
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,880
Everyone's ignoring him.

331
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,000
How can the siblings
live together like this?

332
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,640
Rak must be the general manager.
Rawee's the younger one, he can be deputy.

333
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,200
I've already written it into the will.

334
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,520
If you can write it, you can change it.

335
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Even if Rawee is more capable,

336
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,400
he should support
his older brother from behind,

337
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,840
not leap over him like this.

338
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,200
I've already thought it through carefully.

339
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,640
Then don't you dare die before me.

340
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,400
I believe in seniority.

341
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,600
Otherwise,
what's the point of having siblings?

342
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,880
As long as I'm alive,
I'll fight this with everything I've got.

343
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,680
If I hadn't picked that fight,

344
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,640
you wouldn't have been so stressed
to have walked out and died.

345
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,120
I'm sorry.

346
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,200
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

347
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,800
Is everyone here?

348
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,160
Open the will now.

349
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,320
What will my husband get?

350
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,480
I'll just sneak a listen.

351
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,760
This doesn't concern you.
Don't poke your nose in.

352
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,120
And don't expect a single share.

353
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,640
I won't let my son marry you.

354
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,560
He's not stupid enough
to register a marriage with you.

355
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,240
Once the will is read,

356
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,160
pack your bags and leave my house.

357
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,600
You really don't know me, Mei.

358
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,520
"All gems and jewelry

359
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,360
shall belong solely to Madam Mei."

360
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,080
That's it for cash, gold,

361
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,040
land, and jewelry.

362
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,360
Fair and square.

363
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,480
Let's move on to the businesses.

364
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,000
"The businesses
already assigned to Madam Mei

365
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,000
shall remain hers."

366
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,960
"The rest include,

367
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,040
first, Charoenrung Rice Mill,

368
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,840
second, Charoenrung Hotel,

369
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,240
third, Charoenrung Cinema."

370
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,640
"I hereby bequeath
all three of my businesses

371
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,520
to Mr. Rawee Trongpanich, my son,

372
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,600
granting him full authority
over their management."

373
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,240
What is this?

374
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,320
He has three kids.
How can he give everything to Rawee?

375
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,440
There's a little more.

376
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,960
Then read it.

377
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,080
"I trust that Mr. Rawee
will manage the businesses wisely

378
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,280
and share the benefits equally
among his siblings."

379
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,920
Utter nonsense!

380
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,520
Master completely misjudged him.

381
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,720
Even when he was sick,

382
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,000
Rawee barely visited.

383
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,120
You really think he'll share fairly?

384
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,240
The reason we didn't visit much

385
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,720
was because Dad gave us important work.

386
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,240
What work? I didn't hear about that.

387
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,520
Negotiating with foreign representatives
about the cinema.

388
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,760
Whatever.

389
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,880
I object to this will.

390
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,800
Since your dad gave you full authority,

391
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,600
just divide everything
among your siblings now.

392
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,280
You two, say what you want.

393
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I want the hotel.

394
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,280
I want the cinema.

395
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,360
Then you take the rice mill.
That's the fairest arrangement.

396
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,560
Why are you staring at me?

397
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,320
Just tell the lawyer what you want,

398
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,320
so he can take care of it.

399
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,360
Did you ever love me?

400
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,640
Why did you never ask me what I wanted?
Why am I always the last in your heart?

401
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,680
I don't want the rice mill.

402
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,240
Me neither.

403
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,640
I'm not giving anyone anything!

404
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,360
I'll manage all the businesses myself,
just as Dad wished.

405
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,720
Don't you dare use your dad as an excuse.

406
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,080
You're just selfish.
You don't care about your siblings.

407
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,440
You're trying
to keep everything for yourself!

408
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,480
I'll take the position of manager of
Charoenrung Hotel, as stated in the will.

409
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,520
As for Rak,

410
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,560
he'll be the deputy manager.

411
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,120
Are you just trying to boss me around?

412
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Ranee will manage the cinema.

413
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,040
Ronnakorn will be her assistant .

414
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,280
Isn't this a bit much, Bro?

415
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,120
I never imagined
you two could be this ruthless.

416
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,560
Why don't you just keep the rice mill too?

417
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,520
None of us are skilled
at running a rice mill.

418
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,640
I'll hire a new manager.
Please help post a job announcement.

419
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,960
Yes, Mr. Rawee.

420
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,120
Are you really going against me?

421
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,840
I'm only doing what Dad asked me to do.

422
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,320
You knew about the will, didn't you?

423
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,480
Yes. Dad already told Ranee and me

424
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,520
and asked us to follow it strictly.

425
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,880
Is that all for today?

426
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,680
- Yes, sir.
- Ranee.

427
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,080
Stop right there.

428
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,440
I don't agree with your dad's decision.

429
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,560
I believe family rank is most important.

430
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,240
I don't care how capable you are.

431
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,440
Rak is the eldest son.

432
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,920
He should lead this family, not you.

433
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
If I give in, how will Rak face anyone?

434
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,640
The dead don't matter
more than the living.

435
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,960
If you still see me as your mother,

436
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,560
then do as I say.

437
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,400
The hotel goes to Rak.

438
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,440
The cinema to Ronnakorn.

439
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,280
You take the rice mill.

440
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,040
I'll start managing the hotel tomorrow.

441
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,920
From now on…

442
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,200
I am no longer your mother.

443
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,360
Then I'll take my leave.

444
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,200
You have to stay strong.

445
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,320
I can't live here anymore.

446
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,200
Rawee.

447
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,680
Without Dad…

448
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,440
this house isn't home.

449
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,640
I really can't stay.

450
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,520
Damn it!

451
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,160
It's not just about money.
It's about dignity.

452
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,600
The hotel represents our family's pride.

453
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,320
You're the eldest son.
It should've been yours, not Rawee's.

454
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,200
You can't just let it go.

455
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,320
You and Mom may be right,
but that doesn't change anything.

456
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,760
The hotel was Dad's.
He could give it to whomever he wanted.

457
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,360
So you're just going to let it go?

458
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,400
I won't live
under my younger brother's command.

459
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,200
Then what will you do?

460
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,440
His excuse was that Jiw ordered him.

461
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,880
Who else

462
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,920
heard or saw that?

463
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,800
It was only him and his wife.

464
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,320
Greedy. He wants it all for himself.

465
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,120
It's hard to believe he'd do this.

466
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,720
His wife must've influenced him.

467
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,040
Quiet and meek on the outside,
but just as wicked as her aunt.

468
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,040
Maybe this was all her aunt's setup

469
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,600
to marry him into our family

470
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,000
for the inheritance.

471
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,560
Exactly. Mr. Rawee is soft-hearted.

472
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,000
His wife could've turned him
against his siblings.

473
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,960
Please, Madam, don't be mad at him.

474
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,640
If he doesn't give the hotel to Rak,

475
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,080
I'll never forgive him.

476
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,680
Young Master, where are you going?

477
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,880
I'm moving out.

478
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,920
Why move out?

479
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,520
I don't want us to end up
truly hating each other.

480
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,840
I'm leaving, Mom.

481
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,680
Madam, please stop him…

482
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,440
If you don't give the hotel to Rak

483
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,640
and the cinema to Ronnakorn,
don't ever come back.

484
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,720
I don't want to see your face.

485
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,480
No matter what,

486
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,680
you're still my mother,

487
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,280
CHAROENRUNG CINEMA

488
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,480
My dream is coming true.

489
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,160
Our province's first cinema.

490
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,960
You had so many dreams,

491
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,280
rice mill, hotel, cinema.

492
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,840
Do you still have more?

493
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,120
Plenty.

494
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,720
I'll stop dreaming only when I'm dead.

495
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,000
Then let me carry on this dream.

496
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,800
I'll take care of the cinema.

497
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,560
Are you sure you want to do it?

498
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,000
Yes, Dad.

499
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,120
You knew how much I wanted this.

500
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,640
Why give it to Rawee

501
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,640
and make me just his wife's assistant?

502
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,880
How could you do this to me?

503
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,360
Crying won't help.

504
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,760
Your dad already gave it to Rawee.

505
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,880
Do you really want to be
an assistant to your crush?

506
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,160
This is Dad's order. What can I do?

507
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,200
Do something else. You've got the capital.

508
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,920
What can I do? I never had a dream.

509
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,840
Then take my dream.

510
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,480
I want to open a bar,

511
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,880
stylish, just like in Bangkok.

512
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,280
It'll be the most popular one in town.

513
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,800
It'll be worth every baht.

514
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,000
At least,
you've already got me, Chomechawee,

515
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,520
a former star of a top Bangkok bar,
ready to perform for you.

516
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,760
Mom, I'd like to talk.

517
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,680
What is it?

518
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,120
I won't accept
the deputy manager position.

519
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,920
And I won't accept it either.

520
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,680
You're the eldest.

521
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,680
You shouldn't work under
your younger brother. It's humiliating.

522
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,520
I don't agree with the will.
It's ridiculous.

523
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,840
I want to start my own business.

524
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,080
What do you want to do?

525
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,120
Duangporn and I have a few ideas.

526
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,640
We'll do some research first
to avoid mistakes.

527
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,880
Good.

528
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,160
That's smart.

529
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,160
Be your own boss.

530
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,680
Even if it's smaller than a hotel,

531
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,560
at least you won't be under your brother

532
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,560
and the talk of the town.

533
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,200
So we'd like to take a trip to relax

534
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,440
and do some business scouting.

535
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,880
It'd be good to take a break,

536
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,280
and maybe we'll come back
with a grandson for you.

537
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,760
Good. Go and refresh yourselves.
Maybe your baby will come.

538
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,960
If you decide what to do, just tell me.

539
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,800
If you need money,

540
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,040
I'll fund you fully.

541
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,560
I'll support you all the way.

542
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,320
Thank you, Mom.

543
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,000
Thank you, Mom.

544
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,880
<i>The hotel's lively today.</i>

545
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,320
It's going to get even livelier.

546
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,000
The competitor hotel has terrible service,
totally not worth the price.

547
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,320
And I must thank you and Dad
for helping fund my hotel.

548
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,760
<i>It's Chomechawee.</i>

549
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,840
Am I really going to be a father?

550
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,360
<i>Now that he's got the inheritance,</i>
<i>he wants to move somewhere else?</i>

551
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,800
<i>I don't know when he'll leave.</i>

552
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,320
Then we act tomorrow,
before it's too late.

553
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,840
That mother and son
will pay for what they did to me.

554
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,600
You'd better find a way to warn Rak.

555
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,040
Tub and Chanraem are suspicious.

556
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,520
