1
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,240
Dad.

2
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
Then from this moment on… we're done.

3
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,440
"I hereby bequeath
all three of my businesses

4
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
to Mr. Rawee Trongpanich,

5
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
my son,

6
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,320
granting him full authority
over their management."

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,480
I object to this will.

8
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,440
I want the hotel.

9
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,680
I want the cinema.

10
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm not giving anyone anything!

11
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,360
From now on, I am no longer your mother.

12
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,200
So we'd like to take a trip to relax

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
and do some business scouting.

14
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,800
It'd be good to take a break,

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,400
and maybe we'll come back
with a grandson for you.

16
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,840
Good. Go and refresh yourselves.

17
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,760
Maybe your baby will come.

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,840
If you decide what to do,

19
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,960
just tell me.

20
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,760
If you need money,

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,040
I'll fund you fully.

22
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,480
I'll support you all the way.

23
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,320
Thank you, Mom.

24
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Thank you, Mom.

25
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Today's my last day.

26
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,880
Thank you, sir.

27
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,120
So we're getting nothing at all?

28
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
As expected.

29
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
Good thing you were alert enough

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,440
to keep skimming bits here and there.
Otherwise, we would've gotten nothing.

31
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,680
Those three won't last long
running the businesses.

32
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,080
I've got people planted everywhere,

33
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,480
the hotel, the rice mill, even the market.

34
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,200
Only the cinema's left.

35
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,920
But getting someone in there
won't be hard.

36
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
They'll all go under soon.

37
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,400
I'll wait and see them get
what they deserve. They came at us first.

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,760
They asked for it.

39
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,400
I already threw you out.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,240
What are you doing here?
You really are shameless.

41
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,920
Chome's my wife, Mom.

42
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,720
She may be your wife,
but she's not my daughter-in-law.

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,600
I've never accepted her.

44
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,840
I've had enough
living under the same roof with her.

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,960
I've never had a single happy day
seeing her face.

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
I used to tolerate it

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,400
for your father's sake. But from now on,

48
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
I'll think of myself.

49
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,400
Pack your things
and get out of my house. Now.

50
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,920
If Chome goes, I'll go too.

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Suit yourself.

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,480
If she matters more than I do, then go.

53
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Come on, Chome. Let's pack.

54
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,840
Fine! Go!

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,080
You think you've all grown up now.

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,880
Just don't come crawling back!

57
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,560
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CHANRAEM

58
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,080
I wish you happiness, Chan.

59
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,600
Thank you, Tub.

60
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,440
I never imagined anyone
would celebrate my birthday like this.

61
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
From now on,

62
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,840
I'll celebrate your birthday every year.

63
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
Really, Tub?

64
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,880
I promise. Bigger celebration,

65
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,160
bigger cake.

66
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Oh.

67
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,040
That'll be a waste of money.

68
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,280
We'll just have to earn more.
We'll work harder.

69
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,920
Yes.

70
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,960
What's wrong, Tub?

71
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Don't turn around.
Rak and his wife just walked in.

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,040
‪RESERVED

73
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
Would you like me to serve your food now?

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sure.

75
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
Well.

76
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,200
It's nice to eat out once in a while.

77
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Your brothers have all moved out.

78
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,320
Are you still staying with your mother?

79
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
That house is so suffocating.

80
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,840
If everyone's gone,
who will take care of Mom?

81
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,320
Rawee got the biggest share
of the inheritance. It should be him.

82
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,560
I dream of having a house in Bangkok

83
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
and starting a small business.

84
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,120
I'm so tired of this rural life.

85
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,039
With your inheritance,

86
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,919
we could start fresh in Bangkok.

87
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,000
Let Rawee keep the hotel if he wants.

88
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,880
He'll still have to pay us dividends.

89
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
He can't take it all.

90
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
Don't you agree?

91
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,960
Let's start a new life

92
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,920
that's just ours.

93
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
They look so happy.

94
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,240
I haven't seen him dine out in years.

95
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,120
He must've gotten
a big chunk of inheritance.

96
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,160
Honestly, you should get
some compensation from him.

97
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
Let's look for a spot tomorrow.

98
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,520
Somewhere near the cinema sounds good.

99
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,440
So customers can go from a movie
straight to our place for music.

100
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,360
Can we register the bar under my name?

101
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,760
Sure. Name it whatever you want.

102
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,600
Not the name. I meant

103
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,160
the title deed.

104
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,920
Your mother will never let us marry.

105
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,240
And you're not keen
on registering our marriage either.

106
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,520
If you wanted to,
we would've done it long ago.

107
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,320
If one day you get tired of me
and throw me out,

108
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,960
I'll be left with nothing.

109
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,320
I gave up everything to be with you,

110
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,160
my job, my money.

111
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,320
You should give me some security.

112
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
All right.

113
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
This bar will be yours.

114
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,400
Really?

115
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
Yes.

116
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Korn.

117
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
Thank you.

118
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,880
Are you really not going
to tell your mother

119
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,840
that you're staying here?

120
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,600
She'll worry.

121
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,400
No need.

122
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
She doesn't care that much about me.

123
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,520
But I'd like to go visit her sometimes.

124
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,480
Why go back and let her insult you again?

125
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,600
I can handle it.

126
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,240
She's your mother anyway.

127
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
If you won't take care of her,

128
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,640
as a daughter-in-law,

129
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
I should do it for you.

130
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,080
Fine. Just don't go too often.

131
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,000
The other daughters-in-law
might start drama again.

132
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,040
All right.

133
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Get some rest. It's been a long day.

134
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,920
- All right.
- Let's go.

135
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,560
RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

136
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,280
Look at the camera, please. One, two…

137
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,080
three. Nice!

138
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,880
How is it? Do you like it?

139
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
It still looks new.

140
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,040
Yes, it is.

141
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,120
Why did the last owner sell it?

142
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,680
She married a foreigner
and wants to move abroad.

143
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
Do you like it?

144
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,360
I love it.

145
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,800
Well,

146
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,800
just a few more decorations,
and it'll be ready to open.

147
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
If you're interested,

148
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,280
the price is negotiable.

149
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,440
Didn't you say there's another space
closer to the cinema

150
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,200
for sale?

151
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,560
Well,

152
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,440
this place is already close enough.

153
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,640
Still, you could take a look.
It's just nearby.

154
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,560
It's good to compare

155
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,400
before making a decision.

156
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Your father was a good person.

157
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
PLEASE USE THE NEXT DOOR

158
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,040
Yes, sir.

159
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,160
Excuse me.

160
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,720
Take good care of the business.

161
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Thank you again.

162
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,920
I thought you weren't going to show up.

163
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
How could I not?
You had the nerve to invite me.

164
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,160
From this day on,

165
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
we're officially rivals.

166
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,960
I won't go easy on you anymore.

167
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
Oh.

168
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
And I must thank you and Dad

169
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,480
for helping fund my hotel.

170
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,280
Let's go.

171
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,520
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,680
Is there anything else
you'd like to adjust, Ms. Ranee?

173
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,200
No,

174
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,320
but if Mr. Korn stops by
and wants any changes,

175
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,320
just go ahead with them.

176
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,040
No need to ask for my approval first.

177
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
Just head out of the alley,
and you'll see the cinema right there.

178
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Chome, what are you doing?

179
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,600
I'll be back.

180
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,680
Starting work right away?

181
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,800
Afraid you'll lose out?

182
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,200
The contractor set the appointment.

183
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,400
I thought you were a good person.

184
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,000
Turns out you're just money hungry.

185
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,400
That's enough, Chome. This was Dad's wish.

186
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,760
Come on.

187
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,520
Don't act like a hero.

188
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
Weren't you the one crying
over Dad betraying you?

189
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,000
Why not just say what you really feel?

190
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
Or are you afraid
your ex-lover will be disappointed?

191
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,800
Let's go. Are we doing the bar or not?

192
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,640
No inheritance

193
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
is more valuable
than the love between siblings.

194
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,480
Stop pretending.

195
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,240
You know it well.

196
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,880
I've known the three of you
since childhood.

197
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,200
You were close,
always looking out for each other.

198
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,120
I wished I had siblings too.

199
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,280
I used to envy you.

200
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,640
But now, you're tearing each other apart

201
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,600
over a single will.

202
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,600
Oh, please.

203
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
If your husband isn't greedy

204
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,240
and really cares about his siblings,
why hog all three businesses?

205
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,440
There were so many ways to share fairly.

206
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,800
It's easy.
Just draw lots. Leave it to fate.

207
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,600
If Dad made that decision,
he must have thought it through.

208
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Or do you not trust your father anymore?

209
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Don't fall for her tricks.

210
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
The family's broken
because of your greedy husband.

211
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
‪Chome!

212
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,440
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

213
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,880
Yes?

214
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,800
MANAGER'S OFFICE

215
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,440
The HR manager is here to see you.

216
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
- Let him in.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,640
Please come in.

218
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,480
Have a seat.

219
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
All right.

220
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,600
Nearly every department
had employees submit resignations today.

221
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,040
Do we still have enough staff?

222
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,360
Yes,

223
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,520
but we'll need to assign more shifts.

224
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,760
Let them stop immediately.
No need to wait for one month.

225
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,960
Pay their full month's salary upfront.

226
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
Is that okay?

227
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,600
Even if they stay, they're not going
to work with heart anymore.

228
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,160
I can guess which hotel
they're going to work at next.

229
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,120
Master sure picked
the right person to take over.

230
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,280
I'll handle it right away.

231
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,160
Thank you.

232
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,640
<i>From this day on, we're officially rivals.</i>

233
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,440
<i>I won't go easy on you anymore.</i>

234
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,960
Was it really Chen's hotel
like people are saying?

235
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,920
Yes.

236
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,960
Jiw raised a snake.

237
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,160
Ungrateful people like him
will never prosper.

238
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Let's see

239
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,720
if your master's brilliant son
can beat him.

240
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,800
I believe

241
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,320
Young Master will definitely outdo him.

242
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,760
My big mouth.

243
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
So beautiful.

244
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
How much is this set, Kaew?

245
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,440
We're here for business ideas,
not shopping.

246
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,920
I forgot myself.

247
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,920
Actually, a jewelry shop isn't a bad idea.

248
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,640
The stock doesn't spoil,
and the value increases.

249
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,600
But it's hard

250
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,360
because we don't have
an in-house artisan like your store.

251
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
In the beginning,
you can just sell my pieces.

252
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
I've got everything set.
Once you're doing well,

253
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,320
you can start your own factory later.

254
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,560
That's true.

255
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,600
And the jewelry shop over there
is my mom's friend.

256
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,560
If we also source from them,

257
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,960
she can help get a good price.

258
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,880
Now,

259
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,760
we just need a good location.

260
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,360
Are you interested in opening in Bangkok?

261
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,120
We've been thinking about it.

262
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
I have a shophouse
on a main road up for sale.

263
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,360
The location is great
and perfect for a store.

264
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
Let me know if you're interested.

265
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,120
Should we go see it today?

266
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
Come in.

267
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,920
Oh? Why are you here?

268
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,480
Grandma packed lunch for you.

269
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,320
She said you'd be too busy
and forget to eat.

270
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,120
And she was right.

271
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
Thank her for me.

272
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,320
Sure. Let's eat.

273
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,480
All right.

274
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,440
You didn't have to go to so much trouble.

275
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,480
You checked on the cinema
then drove home to get lunch for me.

276
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,160
Did you forget you're pregnant?

277
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,160
It's all right.

278
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,280
A healthy mom means a healthy baby.

279
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,000
But you still need rest.

280
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,640
Let me do the hard part alone.

281
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
All right.

282
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,560
You're the talk of the town today.

283
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,160
Don't ask what they're gossiping about.

284
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,600
I never thought

285
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,720
Chen could do that to Dad.

286
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,160
Now I understand
why Dad didn't give him the rice mill.

287
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,440
Dad probably knew.

288
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,880
Chen can't deny his role in Dad's death.

289
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,960
He caused it
by forcing Dad to go to that hotel.

290
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,280
You think he'll stop here?

291
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
He even copied our hotel's name.

292
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
He's clearly out to steal customers.

293
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,120
That's true.

294
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,720
Well.

295
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,760
Today, almost 30 of his people resigned.

296
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,640
They've likely joined his hotel.

297
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
But it might be good.

298
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
You can uproot the problem.

299
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,560
But I'm sure
some of his people are still here.

300
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,760
I don't trust anyone now.

301
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,360
Dad was right to leave you in charge.

302
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Rak and Korn wouldn't be decisive enough

303
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,640
to carry the hotel through this crisis.

304
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,680
But if they were here helping…

305
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I'd feel more encouraged to fight.

306
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,040
Let's eat.

307
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,120
The young masters aren't home.
It's so quiet around here.

308
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,240
More like peaceful on the ears.

309
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
Mom!

310
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,240
There it is. Speak of the devil.

311
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,000
What are you here for?

312
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,800
Mom.

313
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,840
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

314
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,240
What do you want?

315
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,960
You really know me too well.

316
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,560
I can see your motive
as soon as you open your mouth.

317
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
Do you know the mother
of the bar owner near Soi 3,

318
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,680
the one close to our cinema?

319
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,440
The one that failed?

320
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
It didn't fail.

321
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,960
Her daughter married a foreigner
and is moving overseas,

322
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,320
so she's closing it up.

323
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,960
So why are you suddenly interested?

324
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,960
I want to buy the building.

325
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,360
Can you help negotiate the price for me?

326
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,800
Maybe we'll get a discount.

327
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,360
Why do you want to buy it?

328
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,320
I want to open a bar.

329
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,080
Oh, my.

330
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,480
Are you opening a brothel?

331
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
No, Ngor! A bar isn't a brothel.

332
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,320
It'll have singers, food, drinks,

333
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,720
just a place to relax at night.

334
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,280
There are so many decent businesses
you could do,

335
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,080
and you choose
a den for late-night scumbags?

336
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,400
This is Chomechawee's idea, isn't it?

337
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,560
I've never run a business before, Mom.

338
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,440
At least Chome has experience.

339
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,200
She used to work in this industry before.

340
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,080
She used to be
a popular bar singer in Bangkok.

341
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,720
That could even be our selling point

342
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,440
and attract customers.

343
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,760
It's a bad idea.

344
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,120
We'll never know if we don't try, Mom.

345
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,320
Maybe this could be my thing.

346
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,840
Would you invest in this for me?

347
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,600
It might need a decent sum.

348
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,120
No. I don't like nighttime businesses.

349
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,160
I hate those nightlife performers.

350
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,800
Why would I help build
a place for people like that?

351
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,760
If you want to invest, do it on your own.

352
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,400
Don't let me find out

353
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,440
that you invested in Rak but not in me.

354
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,520
If I'm going to invest,

355
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,760
I have to see the profit.

356
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,600
I don't care which child it is.

357
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
Then I hope you mean it.

358
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,400
It's my money.
Whether I invest or not is my right.

359
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
Fine. I won't beg you then.

360
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,360
I'll fund it myself.

361
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,040
They say bad company leads you astray.
That's so true.

362
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
We've got three applicants so far.

363
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,920
That was quick.

364
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,600
Everyone wants to work at a big rice mill.

365
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,760
They all meet the requirements.

366
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,680
It's just a matter
of who you connect with more.

367
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,040
Does anyone here have ties to Chen?

368
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,760
There are two.

369
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,520
This one used to work with Mr. Chen.

370
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,000
This one is close to Ms. Hongyok's family.

371
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,520
And this last one?

372
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,600
He's from Bangkok. Preliminary checks

373
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,560
show no connection to Mr. Chen.

374
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,960
CHAROENRUNG RICE MILL APPLICATION FORM

375
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,160
Rawee will definitely choose you,

376
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,240
since you've got no known ties to me.

377
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,040
Start preparing for the job.

378
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,360
I'm not picking any of them.

379
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,520
Oh? Why?

380
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,320
Actually, they're all qualified.

381
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,240
It feels like everything's
been arranged in advance,

382
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,600
no matter what the will says.

383
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
What do you mean?

384
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,920
If Rak got the rice mill,
he'd pick this guy.

385
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,600
He's educated, experienced, and older.

386
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,080
He demands a high salary,
but Rak would be willing to pay.

387
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,640
The next one,

388
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,880
he wants the lowest salary.

389
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,960
His hobbies are music and sports.

390
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,400
If Korn got it,
this is the guy he'd choose.

391
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,720
And the last one from Bangkok

392
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,280
was clearly planted for me.

393
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,760
Why do you think that?

394
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Where did you post the job ad?

395
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,160
We put it up at the rice mill

396
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,160
and in the provincial magazine

397
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,760
when you instructed.

398
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
What is it?

399
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,360
This is the original job posting draft.

400
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,080
I was supposed to review
and sign off before we posted it.

401
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,120
But I haven't signed and sent it back.

402
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
So how did those three even know

403
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,800
we were hiring?

404
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,440
After Dad died,
you lost faith in us, didn't you?

405
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,360
So you started serving both sides.
Taking two paychecks?

406
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,120
What are you saying, Mr. Rawee?

407
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,239
Will you resign,
or will you keep your two salaries

408
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,920
but report directly to me, not Chen?

409
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
Your call.

410
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Are you sure
you don't want me to go with you?

411
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,520
No need, Tub.
Auntie's just overly cautious.

412
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,600
You go park over there.

413
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,600
Why are you eating early today?

414
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,720
Your house ran out of food?

415
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,320
I didn't cook for anyone else.

416
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,760
I didn't come to eat.
I came to grab Rawee's things.

417
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,120
We made some vegetable stew at home,
so I brought some.

418
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Ngor, can you put it in a bowl?

419
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,080
No need.

420
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,440
I'm full.

421
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,560
Yes.

422
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,640
How's Mr. Rawee doing?

423
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,120
Why are you asking about him?
He must be fine,

424
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,480
surrounded by people spoiling him
with his inheritance.

425
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,960
You too.

426
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,000
You don't need to butter me up either.

427
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,040
I'm annoyed. And don't think

428
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,240
I'll give you anything.
It'll never happen.

429
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,520
Well, you'll have to deal with it,

430
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,320
because I'll keep coming back

431
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,920
until you and Rawee reconcile.

432
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,520
I won't let mother and son drift apart

433
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,440
and not know
what's going on in each other's lives.

434
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,040
Excuse me. I'll go get Rawee's things.

435
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,760
Look at her.

436
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,720
She's so stubborn and always talking back!

437
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,680
Ngor,
next time she shows up, kick her out.

438
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Don't let her in again!

439
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,800
But Ms. Ranee's doing the right thing.

440
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,120
Ngor,

441
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,640
are you taking her side?

442
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,800
Get out of my face.

443
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,040
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,240
A jewelry store sounds interesting.

445
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,880
If Rak becomes
the owner of a jewelry store,

446
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,040
he'll look classy, wealthy, and well-bred,

447
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,640
not inferior to anyone.

448
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,600
Yes.

449
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,240
Then, Mom,
how about we split the investment

450
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,520
fifty-fifty?

451
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,400
Where do you plan to open it?

452
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Duangporn and I were thinking…

453
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,400
Bangkok.

454
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,360
Bangkok?

455
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,160
I own buildings all over the province.

456
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,800
Just tell me which one you want,

457
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,360
and I'll give it to you.
Why go all the way to Bangkok?

458
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,440
Expensive items sell faster
and better there, Mom.

459
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,520
I don't agree.

460
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,920
The investment is too high. It's risky.

461
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,240
That's why I want you to help invest, Mom.

462
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,040
No.

463
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,720
It's too risky.
If it fails, that'd be a waste.

464
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,440
Why are you standing there?

465
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,280
I heard you talking,
so I didn't want to interrupt.

466
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,040
Didn't want to interrupt
or just eavesdropping?

467
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,120
You're talking so loud,

468
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
the whole street can hear.

469
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,840
Are you done packing?

470
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,400
Then go back to your husband.

471
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,800
And no need to show up here every day.

472
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,480
See you tomorrow, Mom.

473
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,520
You can't trust her, Mom.

474
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,080
Coming and going like that,

475
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,520
she must have an agenda.

476
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,040
She's pregnant.

477
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,320
She's trying to use the baby
to win your favor for sure.

478
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
‪So, are you going to change your mind
‪about the jewelry store?

479
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,560
I really don't trust Ranee.

480
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,400
That woman's definitely planning

481
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,080
to use her baby to bait your mother.

482
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,280
Most old people
can't resist doting on grandchildren.

483
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,800
Your mom must be that type too.

484
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,320
Then hurry up and get pregnant already.

485
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,320
Mom would definitely love my kid more.

486
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,680
And what about the jewelry store now?

487
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,960
Guess I'll have
to fund it all myself for now.

488
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,280
That's almost all your inheritance.

489
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,200
It's fine.

490
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,600
If anything happens,
Mom will step in eventually.

491
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,880
She didn't agree now

492
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,240
because she doesn't want me to move away.

493
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,000
If you're that confident,

494
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,400
then go ahead with it.

495
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,440
RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

496
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,720
He rejected all three people?

497
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,680
Yes. I sent three

498
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,480
qualified and experienced people.

499
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,840
Do you think he knows
the lawyer's working for us?

500
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,120
If he knew, he'd have been fired by now.
He wouldn't keep him.

501
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,880
That's true.

502
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,800
Whatever.

503
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,480
Let him reject them.

504
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,760
Everyone in the rice mill is still mine.

505
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Anyone they hire to manage
won't last long.

506
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,040
Hello. Welcome.

507
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,800
The hotel's lively today.

508
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,080
It's going to get even livelier.

509
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,080
The competitor hotel has terrible service,
totally not worth the price.

510
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,080
Mr. Rawee, we have a problem.

511
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,240
- What is it?
- We don't have enough night-shift staff.

512
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,640
Why?

513
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,280
They all called in.

514
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Some sick leave, some last-minute.

515
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,480
Have the staff on this shift
finished work?

516
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,960
They're about to finish.

517
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,760
- Tell the department head--
- He's on vacation leave.

518
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,560
A jewelry store?

519
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,400
That takes quite a bit of investment.

520
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,320
He inherited a lot.

521
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,080
Duangporn's family is also wealthy.
It shouldn't be a problem.

522
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,240
But why open it all the way in Bangkok?

523
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,880
That takes a lot more capital

524
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,120
than opening something here at home.

525
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,440
Maybe Duangporn
just wants to be a Bangkok lady.

526
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,800
I don't think so.

527
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,720
I think she wants to be
far away from her mother-in-law.

528
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,840
Whoa.

529
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,120
Who would want to live close
to a controlling mother-in-law like that?

530
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,360
Here's the fruit.

531
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm going to shower.

532
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,400
I feel disgusted talking about her.

533
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,120
Here's pomelo.

534
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,040
And…

535
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,200
What is it?

536
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,200
Tub. Tub!

537
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,240
Rak's going to open
a jewelry store in Bangkok.

538
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,720
Now that he's got the inheritance,
he wants to move somewhere else?

539
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,600
I don't know when he'll leave.

540
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
Then we act tomorrow

541
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,600
before it's too late.

542
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,720
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

543
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,440
Oh.

544
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,640
There are no guests right now.
Just make yourself comfortable.

545
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,680
Thank you, sir.

546
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,680
Thanks for working overtime.

547
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,120
I brought soda and snacks
to help you stay awake. Share them, okay?

548
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,320
Thank you so much.

549
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,080
Let me know if you're too tired.

550
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,320
I'll be on standby here all night.

551
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,600
- Yes, sir.
- Make yourselves comfortable.

552
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,040
Mr. Rawee's so nice.

553
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,560
Not like Mr. Chen.
He never even looked our way.

554
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,840
Here you go.

555
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,680
It's Chomechawee.

556
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,720
So how much commission
will I get for that old bar?

557
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,040
I need to know if it's worth buying.

558
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,960
Good evening.

559
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,840
Welcome, Madam. Right this way, please.

560
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,520
One moment, please.

561
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,920
Hello.

562
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,840
Please wait just a moment.

563
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,560
How many nights again?

564
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,920
Good evening. Did you make a reservation?

565
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,720
- Yes, I did.
- Just a moment.

566
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,440
I'll take care of this guest.

567
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,680
May I have your name, please?

568
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,360
- Anongnart.
- Yes.

569
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,640
‪Yes.

570
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,000
Have a good night, ma'am.

571
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,120
Feeling more refreshed now?

572
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
I feel more refreshed seeing your face.

573
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,160
You should get some rest.

574
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,480
It's late now. There won't be
any more guests checking in.

575
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,520
And you need to rest more too.

576
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,080
You're acting like you're not pregnant.

577
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,200
Even your family said
you haven't gained weight at all.

578
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,120
They'll think
I'm not taking good care of you.

579
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,720
Worry about yourself instead.

580
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,320
You've been working so hard.

581
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm worried
your body won't be able to take it.

582
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,000
Go to bed.

583
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,480
Get lots of rest, okay?

584
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,400
Rak might need your help tomorrow.

585
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,080
Tub and Chanraem are making moves again.

586
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,920
Isn't there any other way?

587
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Why does it always
have to end in hurting each other?

588
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,560
They should just talk

589
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,680
and clear the air already.

590
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,640
You really think
Mom would ever admit her mistakes

591
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,040
and apologize to them?

592
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,160
Chan…

593
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,040
If things don't go as planned tomorrow,

594
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,760
run away.

595
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,760
Don't worry about me.

596
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,640
I won't let it fail again like last time.

597
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,920
That mother and son

598
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,480
will pay for what they did to me.

599
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,320
Mr. Rawee's a good guy.

600
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
He stayed behind to keep us company

601
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,120
and even brought us snacks.

602
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,880
Earlier, I was on a customer call,

603
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,800
and he stepped in
to help check a guest in.

604
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,000
- I saw it.
- He's a natural.

605
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,600
He knew exactly what to do.

606
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,240
Polite, smiling, even better than me.

607
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,200
If no one told me,
I'd never guess he's the owner.

608
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,400
- Bosses like him are rare.
- Right.

609
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,680
So, are you guys

610
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,280
planning to quit like the others
and move to that new hotel?

611
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
His wife's here.

612
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,560
I think we're about to get some good news.

613
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
Your father's investing in our project?

614
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,440
Not about that.

615
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,560
My period is two weeks late now.

616
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
I might be pregnant.

617
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Really?

618
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,800
Am I really going to be a father?

619
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,800
I'm so happy.

620
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,280
- Be gentle.
- Sorry.

621
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,120
Are you feeling any better, ma'am?

622
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,240
Add more ointment.
It's better when it's hot.

623
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,480
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,880
You must've counted money too long.

625
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,280
I counted it to pay you guys.
Or do you not want it?

626
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,280
Of course I do, ma'am.

627
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,640
Young Master's here.

628
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,080
Would you like to eat now?
Madam's waiting.

629
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,720
Mom, go ahead without me.
I've got to get to the hospital.

630
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,600
Oh? Who's sick?

631
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,080
It's him.

632
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,200
He's too excited.

633
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,480
I just missed my period for two weeks.

634
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,640
Are you pregnant?!

635
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,360
I hope so, Ngor.

636
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,800
Of course she is!

637
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,720
That's the best news.

638
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,240
Go get it checked to be sure.

639
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,040
Yes, Mom. If it's real,

640
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,680
my baby will bring luck to the store.

641
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,800
We'll be rich for sure.

642
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,560
- We'll go now. I'll call once we know.
- All right.

643
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,960
Okay. Go ahead.

644
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,240
‪Walk carefully.

645
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,560
I'm looking forward
to the good news, Young Master.

646
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,080
Is something wrong, ma'am?

647
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,600
Looks like

648
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,080
they really will end up
opening the shop in Bangkok.

649
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,440
You can always visit him
when you miss him.

650
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,760
Back when he was at boarding school,

651
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,200
he only came home on weekends.

652
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,000
Not much different.

653
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,160
You're right.

654
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,480
If I miss him, I'll go visit.

655
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,000
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,000
But too bad.

657
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,920
She should've gotten pregnant earlier.

658
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,560
Their kid would've been
the first grandchild.

659
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,560
That's true.

660
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,320
No need. Have a seat.

661
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,520
Make yourselves comfortable.

662
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,480
Sorry to interrupt.

663
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,840
I just wanted to thank you all
for staying late to help the hotel.

664
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,120
I truly appreciate it.

665
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,720
I'll be giving everyone
special overtime pay.

666
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,200
You'll be paid daily,

667
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,480
not at the end of the month.

668
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,200
That's good.

669
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:10,720
If you want to work overtime again,
just sign up after collecting your pay.

670
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,200
That way I'll know
how many we'll have each day.

671
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,560
Mr. Rawee.

672
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,560
Will we be hiring more staff?

673
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,680
A lot of people already quit.

674
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,040
Let me observe for one more month.

675
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,120
That's all for now.
Thank you again, everyone.

676
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
Fish porridge is ready.

677
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,320
- Here it is.
- Grandma.

678
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,560
Tub and Chan are on leave today.

679
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,440
No need to cook lunch for them.

680
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,400
Where did they go?

681
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,520
No idea. I didn't think to ask.

682
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,000
- Let's eat.
- The fish is so fresh.

683
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,480
They made…

684
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,480
Cha-aim, keep an eye on them.

685
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,600
Stall them as long as you can.

686
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,560
Go now.

687
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,760
Don't run. Remember you're pregnant.

688
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,800
You'd better find a way to warn Rak.

689
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,000
Tub and Chanraem are acting suspicious.

690
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,920
I don't know how long
Cha-aim can delay them.

691
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,720
Tub, that's Rak and his wife.

692
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,120
Luck is on our side.

693
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,360
- Help!
- Shut up, unless you want to get hurt.

694
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,080
If you're that stingy, I'll take it all.

695
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,840
I'm here to congratulate you.

696
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,640
I can't just sit by
and watch those three brothers succeed.

697
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,320
Get out, all of you!

698
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,880
Go!

699
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,480
If the one who inherited it all was Rak,

700
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,640
you would've stood up for him,
tried to mediate peace between us.

701
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,280
But it was me, the one you never loved.

702
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,600
Do you want to know what else Dad told me?

703
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,280
