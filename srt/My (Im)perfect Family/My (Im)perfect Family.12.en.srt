1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm going to marry her.

2
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,720
Stop dictating. Stop putting
your own will above everyone else's.

3
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,360
He seems sharper than the rest.

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
<i>He might ruin our plans.</i>

5
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Manager, we've got a problem.

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,080
There's a hotshot newcomer
heading to the company.

7
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,720
Don't let him get there.

8
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>But if he's smart enough, he should know</i>

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,280
to stay out of it.

10
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,680
I suspected corruption at the hotel.

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,320
<i>So it might not have been a random</i>
<i>robbery. It could've been an ambush</i>

12
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,240
to keep you quiet.

13
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,120
- Chat?
- Yes, it's me.

14
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,640
Come back to Bangkok with me!

15
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
No, I'm not going!

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
Hello?

17
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,720
Yes.

18
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,000
No, he's not asleep.

19
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Is it Mom?

20
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,360
You want us to come home now?

21
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
<i>Prajak is on his way.</i>

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,480
<i>Tell Korn to get ready too.</i>

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
All right.

24
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,280
What about Chome?

25
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,240
If she doesn't come with us,
Korn probably won't go back either.

26
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,240
<i>I don't care anymore.</i>
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>

27
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,640
She hung up.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
What's really going on?

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,360
At first, she insisted I stay
at the hospital for safety.

30
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,600
Now, she's telling us
to go home immediately.

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
Weird.

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,760
What should I do, then?

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,920
You have to come home with us.

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
What if your brother
comes back and hurts you again?

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,440
If Mom didn't want you at the house,
she would've said so.

36
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,120
She won't outright say she allows it.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,600
It's like she'd be swallowing her pride.

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Are you here to visit a patient?

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
Yes,

40
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
but I think I got the wrong room.

41
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
All right.

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,880
Time to take your medicine.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,560
I ordered some bird's nest soup.
It's good for your health.

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,040
It's a waste of money.

46
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,600
Exactly. We've got plenty in the kitchen,
enough to last a year.

47
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
Better to have too much than too little.

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Dad's health isn't what it used to be.

49
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,200
He should drink more of it.

50
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,040
What we have might not be enough.

51
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,080
Well, all right.

52
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
Thank you, Chen.

53
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
- Ngor.
- Yes, ma'am?

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Take this to the kitchen.

55
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
Finish what we already have first.

56
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,720
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,680
We'll eat the new stuff later.

58
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,480
Don't shove it in the back
of the cabinet and forget about it.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,160
Yes, ma'am.

61
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,320
Looks like everyone got injured.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Because we've got a jinx in the house.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
Everything was peaceful.

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,520
The moment she showed up,

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,840
everyone's been hit with bad luck.

66
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,040
So what happened to your leg?

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,440
I thought you already knew.

68
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,920
How would I know?
I was in meetings all day.

69
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Ngor, start serving the rice.

70
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,640
- Yes, sir.
- Hold on.

71
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,080
I have something to say to everyone.

72
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
You've snagged a rich husband?

73
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,880
Smart move.

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Who are you here to see?

75
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,000
Well,

76
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,280
is this Mr. Nikhom's house?

77
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,720
No. This is Master Jiw's house.

78
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Sorry, wrong house.

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,880
I'll make you pay dearly.

80
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,320
I believe our family is going
through a streak of bad luck.

81
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,480
Especially my sons.

82
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
I want the three of you

83
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,160
to stay home for now.

84
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,080
If you must go out,

85
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,680
go with someone. Don't go alone.

86
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
So how long
do we have to stay in the house, Mom?

87
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,400
You can go back to work
after next month's Moon Festival.

88
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Just think of it
as a sick leave to recover.

89
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
Does this include Chen too?

90
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,480
I said my sons. What does
your husband have to do with anything?

91
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
All right.

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
I want you all

93
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,120
to run a charity kitchen at the shrine.

94
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,960
It'll be a merit-making ritual
to ward off bad luck.

95
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,760
Each family is responsible

96
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,920
for their own food.

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,880
Use your own money,
not the family's funds.

98
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,560
Everyone has their own savings now.

99
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
If you're short, just say so.

100
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
That's all I have to say.

101
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
And just because
I haven't kicked you out yet

102
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,320
doesn't mean I've accepted you
as a daughter-in-law.

103
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,160
Don't flatter yourself.

104
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
You're not eating with us?

105
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,520
I've lost my appetite. I feel suffocated.

106
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,680
I'll eat in my room.

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,720
If you're so uncomfortable
that you can't even eat,

108
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,760
why did you ask me and Chome
to come back in the first place?

109
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
If you weren't my son,

110
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,240
I wouldn't care if you lived or died.

111
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,520
Unless you want to cut ties with me,

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,640
do what I say.

113
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Shut your mouth and sit down.

114
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
Can we eat now?

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm starving.

116
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,320
Ngor.

117
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,920
Yes, sir.

118
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,760
Come on.

119
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,960
Madam, you really aren't going
to throw her out?

120
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
I just feel bad for Mr. Korn.

121
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,600
He finally gets a wife,
and she can't even compare to the others.

122
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,440
She's even worse than Chen's wife.

123
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,480
Don't mention that name to me.

124
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,640
Sorry, ma'am.

125
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
You don't sail against a strong current.

126
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,280
If I kicked her out like last time,

127
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,640
Korn would run off again.

128
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,680
So you have a plan to deal with her?

129
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
Like you said,

130
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,960
she's no match

131
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
for the other daughters-in-law.

132
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,360
We'll use that weakness to our advantage.

133
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,440
I believe

134
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
she'll feel so worthless and unwanted,

135
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,600
she'll leave on her own
and take herself out of Korn's life.

136
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,040
That way,

137
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,320
he can't blame me for anything.

138
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,320
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
CHARITY KITCHEN

140
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,480
- Come on.
- Take it.

141
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
- This way.
- Here.

142
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,000
- Here you go.
- Come this way.

143
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Here's some hot mee sua.

144
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,760
- All right.
- This way.

145
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,680
- This way.
- Please line up.

146
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,160
Come take it.

147
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,640
Take it.

148
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,120
Hot mee sua from Madam Mei.

149
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,640
Come and get some, everyone.

150
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,960
Come take it while it's still hot.

151
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Pad Thai here.

152
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Authentic rice noodles.

153
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,080
- They have pad Thai too!
- Fragrant tamarind sauce.

154
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,080
- I'll leave it here first.
- Traditional old-school recipe!

155
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,400
Thank you.

156
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
Just a moment, please!

157
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Our chef may be old and slow,

158
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,040
but the food will blow your mind.

159
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,480
Pissamai guarantees it.

160
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,160
It's ready.

161
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,000
Pad Thai by Grandma Obchoey,

162
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,120
guaranteed to be delicious!

163
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
Khanom krok here.

164
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,760
Khanom krok here.

165
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,360
You can line up for khanom krok.

166
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,120
The line for pad Thai is so long.

167
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,880
Grab some khanom krok instead.

168
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes, you can take it. Please take it.

169
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,640
Here it is.

170
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
All right.

171
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,880
- I'll take that drink.
- Sure.

172
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,600
Here it is. Thank you.

173
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,600
Come grab one.

174
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,200
- Here it is.
- Fried pork?

175
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,960
- All right.
- All right.

176
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,320
Take two if you want.

177
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,160
Hot pork and sticky rice, right here.

178
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,400
It must feel great
to be reunited with pork again.

179
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
You look so happy.

180
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,200
You've put in your own money and effort.

181
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,160
You'll earn more merit
than the rest of us.

182
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,720
That's truly admirable,

183
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,600
former pork vendor and day laborer.

184
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
Ignore them.

185
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,680
We're here to make merit
for those three siblings.

186
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,720
Hey! We're not dead yet.

187
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,040
Oh, my bad.

188
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
I meant to say to ward off bad luck.

189
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,160
And if you don't want to end up
butchered like the pigs,

190
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,480
shut up.

191
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,800
I'm heading out.

192
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,080
Be careful.

193
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,080
All right.

194
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
Khanom krok here!

195
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,560
You can take it.

196
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,200
Tub, let's go. There's no time.

197
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,200
Yes.

198
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,840
All right. You can take it.

199
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,320
I want that one.

200
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,920
Smart move.

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,480
Limited budget, so they went for drinks.

202
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,360
They need a drink to go with their food.

203
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
No need to compete on taste.

204
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,040
It probably wasn't her idea.

205
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,680
It must have been my son's idea.

206
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,760
That singer can't be smarter than my son.

207
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,480
I don't even know if she graduated.

208
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,400
Right. Looks like your pressure tactics
didn't work this time.

209
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,600
There's always next time.

210
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,600
Because it's a charity event,

211
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,240
her good karma saved her.

212
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,880
Are you tired?

214
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,600
No.

215
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,280
Would you like…

216
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,240
Meet me in front of the shrine
if you don't want trouble for your family.

217
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
Can I get the green drink?

218
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,040
Please help yourselves for a moment.
We need a quick restroom break.

219
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,200
Yes.

220
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Khanom krok this way.

221
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,720
Where is Rawee?

222
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,359
His leg isn't better yet.
He's probably sitting around somewhere.

223
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,680
I don't trust this.
Madam never let him leave the house.

224
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,800
Today might be his chance.

225
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,640
He could be sneaking off
to gather evidence at the hotel.

226
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,400
ACCOUNTING - FINANCE DOCUMENTS
PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS

227
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,960
ACCOUNTING - FINANCE DOCUMENTS

228
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,920
Why isn't Prasitphat Company listed?

229
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,720
If you really love my sister,
then make it official and marry her.

230
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
As for the dowry,

231
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,280
our parents are gone,
so it should go to me.

232
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,080
You've been

233
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,800
taking money from me every month.
Isn't it enough?

234
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,840
That's compensation for losing my sister.

235
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,120
Pay it all at once and we're done.

236
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you sure that'll be the end of it?

237
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm a man of my word.

238
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,800
But the amount has to be fair.

239
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Deal.

240
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,800
So when's the wedding?

241
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,480
We'll need some time.

242
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,680
There's a problem at home right now.

243
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,040
It's not a good time for a wedding.

244
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
At the end of the month,

245
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,800
I'll be back for your answer.

246
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,960
Your family seems close.

247
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
If even one person were gone,

248
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
I bet they'd be devastated.

249
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,040
Leave them out of this.

250
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
See you at the end of the month.

251
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,040
I'm so sorry.

252
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,440
I've dragged your family into this.

253
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,120
Don't think like that.

254
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,360
We're in the same boat now.
We'll make it through together.

255
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,160
Why are you in such a rush?
Stay and talk a bit.

256
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,080
You're sharper than your brothers,

257
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,200
just like I thought.

258
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,840
Why would you embezzle
from your own hotel?

259
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,760
Your mother's trying
to take everything back from me.

260
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm not walking away empty-handed.

261
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,640
Once Dad is gone,

262
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,200
do you think Madam
will still consider me family?

263
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,160
That she'll let me and Hong
stay in the house?

264
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,440
Run the mill like before? Not a chance.

265
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
Dad's a fair man.

266
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,120
He'll include you in the will.

267
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,680
I never count on promises.

268
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Wills can be rewritten.

269
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,920
Just tear it up, and it's gone.

270
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,920
I've never trusted Madam Mei.

271
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,600
She hates me to the core.

272
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,480
Even with her own sons,
she plays favorites.

273
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,360
You know that.

274
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,360
And me? What am I to her?

275
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,960
A rightful heir? Dream on.

276
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,200
I had to do this to survive.

277
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,440
If you really see me
as a brother, like you say,

278
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,600
then pretend you saw nothing.

279
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,880
Consider it your way of making peace
with your father's overlooked child.

280
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,440
How much did you take?

281
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,320
Compared to you three

282
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,960
blowing money overseas
for six years? It's nothing.

283
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll stop digging.

284
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,680
But you need to stop too.
No more stealing from our family.

285
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,920
But if you keep hurting this family…

286
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
I won't stand by again.

287
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,120
Tired, but it feels good, doesn't it?

288
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,040
Are you tired, Grandma?

289
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,720
Not at all, dear.

290
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,480
Seeing people enjoy the food

291
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,640
and come back for more

292
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,760
just warms my heart.

293
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm not tired at all.

294
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,920
Yes.

295
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,880
- Sweetheart.
- Yes?

296
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,360
How's it going,
being daughter-in-law in that family?

297
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,720
So many people, so many problems.

298
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,760
They argue every day.

299
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
One thing ends, another begins.

300
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,040
I don't know how they manage
to eat with all that tension.

301
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
True. Meals don't even taste good.

302
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,920
Nothing suits my taste.

303
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
I miss home.

304
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,040
I miss your cooking, Grandma.

305
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,280
I want to come back home.

306
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,320
You're tired of your husband already?

307
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,800
I just want him to live here with me.

308
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,600
As if his mother would let that happen.

309
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,440
She guards her son
like a cobra guarding her eggs.

310
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,560
Who knows?

311
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,960
I don't think Rawee's dad and mom
love him as much as their other sons.

312
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,120
Like the other week,
when all three of them got hurt,

313
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,480
it was so obvious.

314
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,200
Take it.

315
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,080
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

316
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,680
Thank you, Dad.

317
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,640
<i>I've seen his dad secretly giving</i>
<i>extra money to Korn frequently.</i>

318
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,400
<i>But Rawee only used his monthly allowance.</i>

319
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,680
Mix this exactly as I told you

320
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,720
and apply it to Rak's face
every morning and evening.

321
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,920
That way, he won't be left with scars.

322
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,720
Otherwise,
his lucky features will be ruined.

323
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,960
Yes, Mom.

324
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,720
<i>Rawee's limping and hurt,</i>

325
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,160
<i>and yet Mom didn't even show</i>
<i>a shred of concern.</i>

326
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
You skin will be ruined.

327
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
Let me see.

328
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,440
I can't help but feel sorry for Rawee.

329
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,280
But maybe he's used to it by now.

330
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,320
Dad loves the youngest.
Mom loves the eldest.

331
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
Even I can see that.

332
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,320
It's middle child syndrome, dear.
That's just how it is.

333
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
I'm sure
their parents love all their kids.

334
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,680
But maybe
they worry more about the other two,

335
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,440
since Rawee's more capable than the rest.

336
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,480
It's true.
Maybe I'm too biased toward Rawee.

337
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,040
Here I am!

338
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Well,

339
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,600
speak of the devil.
We were just talking about you.

340
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,320
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

341
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Take it slow.

342
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,920
Be careful.

343
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm all right.

344
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Why don't you two stay for dinner tonight?

345
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,760
Then head home later.

346
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,960
If your mom causes trouble again,

347
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,960
just have her call me.

348
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,920
Thank you, Auntie.

349
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,520
I told you

350
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,640
I had a way to deal with that Rawee.

351
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,360
A guy like him is nothing.

352
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
Just all talk.

353
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
You really know how to push his buttons,

354
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,640
that complex
about being the overlooked child.

355
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,040
That bleeding heart of his
is his weakness.

356
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,200
Then there's the rice mill budget.

357
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,360
Duangporn's easy.

358
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,280
Just give her a little bribe,

359
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,880
and she won't bother
going through past records.

360
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,880
That's true. She's lazy

361
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,640
and loves comfort.

362
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,200
Then let's proceed
with the interior renovations.

363
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,840
It's finally our time.

364
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,320
We've put up
with their oppression long enough.

365
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,640
I give you an inch, and you take a mile.

366
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,480
I already told you.

367
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Letting her stay in this house

368
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,240
doesn't mean I accept her
as a daughter-in-law.

369
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,080
We just came back from a merit-making
trip, and I was in a good mood.

370
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,320
But now you've ruined it again.

371
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,680
But if I just live with Chome
without marrying her,

372
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,240
her brother won't stop harassing us.

373
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Then just break up. It's not that hard.

374
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,040
If your own happiness matters

375
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,680
more to you than this family's,
then do what you want.

376
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,280
I did it for the family.

377
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,120
You did it for yourself.

378
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,360
If I weren't afraid for my son's safety,

379
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,360
there's no way
I'd let you set foot in this house.

380
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,240
A woman like you

381
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,440
is nothing but someone
he shares a bed with.

382
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,840
Take it or leave it.

383
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,080
- Mom. Mom!
- Enough, Korn.

384
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,840
I'm tired.

385
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,320
Don't give me any more to worry about.

386
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,480
Let's go. It's not our business.
Less stress that way.

387
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm having dinner with friends tonight.

388
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,000
There's too much drama in this house.
I've lost my appetite.

389
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,760
You're leaving me here alone?

390
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,960
Mom won't let you leave the house
until after the Moon Festival.

391
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
I'll eat for both of us, then.

392
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,200
I might be home late.
It's been a while since I went out.

393
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,880
Did you find any evidence at the hotel?

394
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,200
All the evidence was destroyed.

395
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,200
Chen admitted everything.
He confessed to embezzlement.

396
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,760
So what now?

397
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
He asked me to turn a blind eye.

398
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,280
He said

399
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,320
it was something he deserved as Dad's son.

400
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,520
And what did you say?

401
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
I didn't want to risk making things worse.

402
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,640
And it wasn't that much.

403
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Dad's health isn't great anymore.

404
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,320
I don't want to cause him more stress.

405
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,640
But it's not right.

406
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,960
If every son wants money,
should they just steal from the business?

407
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,240
None of us would do that.

408
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,600
But I pity Chen.

409
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,760
I understand him.

410
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,320
Let's just say it's compensation for
all the resentment he's been holding in.

411
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm afraid he won't stop at just this.

412
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,040
I already warned him to not do it again,
or I wouldn't let it go.

413
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,160
You think he's scared of you?

414
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
I don't know if he is.

415
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,480
But I won't let it slide again.
This was the only time.

416
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,040
You're late.

417
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,640
Time to wake up, Mr. Rak.

418
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
I love you.

419
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,280
Let go of me. I'm not Tub.

420
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,120
Chanraem Trongpanich…

421
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,239
Be careful, Rawee.

422
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,280
Bro.

423
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,120
Can we talk?

424
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,880
I'll go take a shower first.

425
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,440
What's going on?

426
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,720
Chome's brother showed up again.

427
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,000
What did he want?

428
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,040
He wants me to marry Chome officially.

429
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,960
He's asking for a dowry.

430
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,200
He threatened to hurt our family

431
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,680
if I don't agree.

432
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,680
You know Mom will never allow it.

433
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm afraid I'll cause everyone trouble.

434
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,320
How much time did he give you?

435
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
He said he'll contact me again
at the end of the month.

436
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,000
What should I do?

437
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,720
Dear.

438
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
I just went downstairs to get you water
and walked right into something.

439
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
What is it?

440
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,840
I saw Rak and Chanraem hugging each other.

441
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
She remembers everything now?

442
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Would they be hugging
like that if she didn't?

443
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,400
Now I've got a way
to get back at that Duangporn.

444
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,640
She looked down on me.

445
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,200
Then before you leave this house,

446
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,000
why don't you stir things up

447
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
among the daughters-in-law?

448
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,680
Mei started this war.

449
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,560
She doesn't deserve to be happy.

450
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,520
Chan? Why are you crying?

451
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,040
Tub.

452
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,640
What's wrong?
Did someone do something to you?

453
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,960
Tell me and I'll take care of it.

454
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,560
It was Rak, wasn't it?

455
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,600
Right?

456
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,120
Tub.

457
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,760
Mr. Rak and I

458
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
used to be in love, right?

459
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,400
Right?

460
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,720
Right?

461
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,040
Tub?

462
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,080
Come on,

463
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,800
how would that be possible?

464
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,920
He's your boss. We're just staff.

465
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,600
It's like Heaven and Earth.

466
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,440
Someone like Mr. Rak
wouldn't be interested in people like us.

467
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,520
I think you might be confusing

468
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,360
dreams with reality.

469
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,280
It's like when we have
a crush on a celebrity

470
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,320
and dream of being with them.

471
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,760
Maybe you once dreamed

472
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,760
of being the wife
of a rich heir like Mr. Rak.

473
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,240
And don't say things like this
to anyone else, okay?

474
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,600
If I lose this job,

475
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,840
I won't be able to buy
pretty clothes for you anymore.

476
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,280
Okay.

477
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,240
I won't say it to anyone.

478
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,440
Just you.

479
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,480
Good girl.

480
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,760
Where've you been?

481
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,000
You're back late.

482
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,720
Say what you came to say.
Why are you waiting for me here?

483
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,640
Next time you go out late,

484
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
you should take your husband with you.

485
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,880
Just get to the point.

486
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm tired.

487
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,960
I'd better not say it.

488
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,680
You might go running to Madam Mei again,
and I'll get in trouble.

489
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,920
I won't fall for it again.

490
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,040
If you don't say it,
will you be able to sleep tonight?

491
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,400
You've been waiting here all night.
Don't hold it in until you burst.

492
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm more worried
you won't be able to sleep

493
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,000
after I tell you.

494
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,040
So you're not going to tell me?
Great, I'll go sleep then.

495
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,520
Old stories are worth retelling.

496
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,040
Because old flames are about to reignite.

497
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Who are you talking about?

498
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,080
Your husband.

499
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,080
I saw him hugging Chanraem in the kitchen.

500
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,760
- Chanraem?
- Yes.

501
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,000
The wife of Tub, Ranee's driver.

502
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,800
That girl.

503
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,040
The former maid Rak got pregnant.

504
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,040
The one I told you about before,

505
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,840
and you betrayed me.

506
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,040
<i>I know every detail about those two.</i>

507
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,200
Back when Chanraem was pregnant,

508
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,200
we were close.

509
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,880
We shared the same fate.

510
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,160
If you want the full truth,

511
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,720
let's meet and talk again.

512
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,920
This story will take all night
if I start telling it now.

513
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,160
And if you don't believe me,

514
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,560
keep a close eye on your husband and her.

515
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,000
Having an affair with a driver's wife?

516
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,440
If it were me? I'd be ashamed to death.

517
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,960
You may be
the favorite daughter-in-law now.

518
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,080
But if your husband
causes another scandal,

519
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760
no one will respect you anymore.

520
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,120
I'm certain

521
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,520
Dad will make Rawee
the heir instead of Rak.

522
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,040
And by then,

523
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,800
even if you keep the title
of first daughter-in-law…

524
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,720
the true power and influence…

525
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,080
will probably belong to Ranee.

526
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,240
You're quite punctual.

527
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,720
So, when's the wedding?

528
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,040
How much is the dowry?

529
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,040
My mom won't let us marry.

530
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,680
And?

531
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm not leaving Chome.

532
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,080
That's easy for you to say.

533
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,480
You think my sister is worthless?

534
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,800
Chat!

535
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,320
- Calm down.
- Chome!

536
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,560
You shut up! Don't be stupid!

537
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,800
You already gave yourself to him.

538
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,280
If you don't get a ceremony,
you'd better get that marriage license.

539
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,120
My mom would never allow that either.

540
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,680
No wedding,

541
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,640
no marriage certificate.

542
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,920
- Fine! I'm taking my sister home.
- No.

543
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,360
I won't allow it. Chome's staying with me.

544
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,040
What?

545
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,920
Chat!

546
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,040
No! Don't hurt him.

547
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,800
You think
you can just get my sister for free?

548
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,320
Stop!

549
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,440
After him.

550
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,040
Korn, Chome, are you two okay?

551
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,360
I'm okay,

552
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,560
but you could've come a bit sooner.

553
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,720
How did you get here, Mr. Rawee?

554
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,520
It was his plan.

555
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,640
Chome, you don't have
to be afraid anymore.

556
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,600
Your brother's on the police watchlist.
He won't dare show up again.

557
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,160
Thank you so much.

558
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,880
I really did ask
the right person for help.

559
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,640
It's all over now.

560
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,680
Are you stupid?

561
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,040
You walked right into their trap
and didn't even know it.

562
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,080
Who would've thought
a mama's boy like him had the guts?

563
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,040
Hey!

564
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,680
Or did you and him set me up together?

565
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,600
You found yourself a younger husband
and tossed me aside?

566
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,000
Are you insane? Let go, that hurts!

567
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,560
You'd better run
before we both go down for this.

568
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,680
This isn't going to be
as easy as we thought.

569
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,920
His mom is a nightmare.
I want to slap her.

570
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,360
Just give me a little more time.

571
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,240
Once I get that marriage license,
we'll be set for life when I divorce.

572
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,000
If you're planning to dump me…

573
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,200
I won't let you go, Chome.

574
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,760
Hey, I'm still your wife.

575
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,720
We've been through hard times together.
We'll improve our lives together.

576
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,640
Fine.

577
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,320
I'll trust you.

578
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,880
All right.

579
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,760
Go hide at your mom's place for now.

580
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,440
Fine.

581
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,800
But…

582
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,640
you have to

583
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,800
come visit me, okay?

584
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,960
I'll miss you.

585
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,600
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

586
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,320
Now go before more cops show up.

587
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,720
Like hell I'd go back to you.

588
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,520
Why did Mom suddenly
invite us all out for tea?

589
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,400
Exactly. Especially me.

590
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,440
I'm somehow being counted
as a daughter-in-law too.

591
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,360
Maybe she just wants us to stay united.

592
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,000
But one's missing. Chomechawee.

593
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,000
Madam despises her. She doesn't even
recognize her. Why would she invite her?

594
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,760
- Tea for the first daughter-in-law.
- Thank you.

595
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,640
Madam is here.

596
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,520
You're all here now.

597
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,640
The reason I called everyone together is

598
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,120
because we'll be hosting
a Moon Festival celebration.

599
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,240
I'd like all daughters-in-law
to help prepare the offerings.

600
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,800
After the celebration,

601
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,920
all three of my sons
will return to work as usual.

602
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,960
I'd like all of you

603
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,400
to help keep an eye on things.
Look after them.

604
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,880
Yes.

605
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,520
There's one more thing

606
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,320
I'd like to ask of you all.

607
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,040
Chomechawee

608
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,760
is not fit to be
a daughter-in-law of this family.

609
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,320
As daughters-in-law,

610
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,400
I'm sure none of you want
to associate yourselves with someone

611
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,440
who has no upbringing, no education,

612
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,880
and who has made a living dancing
and performing. Her brother's a thug too.

613
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,200
I can't do this alone.

614
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,080
I want all of you

615
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,600
to find a way

616
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,520
to drive Chomechawee out of this house
before it's too late.

617
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,840
Whoever makes it happen,

618
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,440
I'll give you a big reward.

619
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,320
Please count me out of this.

620
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,200
Excuse me.

621
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,960
What's that supposed to mean?

622
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,280
I don't want to do it.

623
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,640
I'm afraid that tearing people
who love each other apart

624
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,680
will bring bad karma
to my own relationship.

625
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,040
You're really good with words.

626
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,280
You're cruel.

627
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,360
So you want Korn to fall behind
while your husband climbs to the top?

628
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,120
Isn't Rawee your son too?

629
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,640
Chome may not live up to your standards,

630
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,840
but Korn may value
different things in a wife.

631
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,160
If Chome had a choice,

632
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,440
I'm sure she'd rather have been born
into a wealthy family,

633
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,360
with money for school

634
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,520
and a stable career.

635
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,800
She's been through enough.

636
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,120
She deserves a chance to prove herself.

637
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,000
She might even end up being
a better daughter-in-law than all of us.

638
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,760
What a saint.

639
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,160
Save that mindset
for your own children then.

640
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,440
It's all right
if she doesn't want to help, Mom.

641
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,280
Just the two of us will be enough.

642
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,480
If you'll excuse me.

643
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,880
Go wherever you want.

644
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,360
She's just as bad as her aunt.

645
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,920
Chan?

646
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,200
Chan?

647
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Where could she be?

648
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,760
I'm just going out for a bit.
No need for a whole entourage.

649
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,480
You don't need to worry, Mom.

650
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,680
Your peace of mind is the responsibility--

651
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,040
Of your daughters-in-law, of course.

652
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,160
Hearing that makes me feel a lot better.

653
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,680
If you have a good sister-in-law,
it'll be good for you all too.

654
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,200
Exactly.

655
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,920
Just don't forget
the reward you promised, Madam.

656
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,360
I'm ready to pay.

657
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,960
Just find a way
to get that woman out of my house.

658
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,000
She's been a thorn in my side
for far too long.

659
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,360
- Yes, Mom.
- Yes, Madam.

660
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,520
- Ngor, let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

661
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,080
Chan, where are you?

662
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,480
We should go now.

663
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,640
Good thing I found you.

664
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,520
Oh?

665
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,680
Is there something you need me to do?

666
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,040
Mr. Rak.

667
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,480
Hey!

668
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,440
Let go of me.

669
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,360
I'm not leaving. My husband is here.

670
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,960
Have her committed to an asylum!

671
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,920
This isn't over.

672
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,800
You and Rak haven't paid for what you did.

673
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,280
If Rak hadn't messed around
with Chanraem first,

674
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,360
none of this would've happened.

675
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,480
What the hell?

676
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,720
You're blaming this all on me
just to protect your wife?

677
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,440
- Am I wrong?
- You damn loudmouth!

678
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,360
<i>Hey.</i>

679
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,280
<i>Stop it.</i>

680
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,080
- Dad!
- Dad!

681
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,040
- Dad!
- Dear!

682
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,120
- Dad!
- Dad!

683
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,720
Oh, no!

684
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,200
It's not what everyone thinks.

685
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,680
Ranee.

686
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,200
