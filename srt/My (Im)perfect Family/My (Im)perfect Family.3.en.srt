1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,600
Rawee!

2
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
<i>It's fine if it's just a passing thought,</i>

3
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,600
<i>but don't actually fall for him.</i>

4
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,760
Madam would never allow
a relationship between you two.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>Will we see each other again?</i>

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,640
<i>I wish we had more time together.</i>

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,000
Want to lose your virginity?
I'll take you.

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>All three of you.</i>

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>I'm the eldest brother.</i>
<i>I'll cover everything.</i>

10
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,960
<i>I don't know, Dad.</i>

11
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
<i>It's red and swollen too.</i>

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, no,

13
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
you went to a brothel, didn't you?

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,840
Tell me. Which one of your friends
dragged you into this mess?

15
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
Tell me!

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,560
Is Ranee graduating from high school soon?

17
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,600
One more year.

18
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,520
Hard to believe.

19
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,200
It feels like she was just standing
next to you hugging a doll yesterday.

20
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,280
I know, right?

21
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,080
Once she finishes high school,
that's one less thing to worry about.

22
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,360
Ranee is smart.
She'll definitely graduate.

23
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,920
Thank you.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
-From your lips to God's ears.
-Thank you.

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,680
Oh.

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,880
Wow, you're all here already.

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,200
I thought you were going to ditch us.

28
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
Of course not.

29
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,840
Hey.

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,320
I just came from the Old Market.

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,440
Guess who I ran into?

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Who?

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,960
What?

34
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,880
Don't tell me it was that Mei Hua.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,680
Just the thought of her ruins my appetite.

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,320
No, not her, but close.

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
Who?

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
I saw her husband and son.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,480
Wasn't her son
supposed to be taking final exams?

40
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Why didn't he go back to Bangkok?

41
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
Yeah.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,760
Probably sick from being promiscuous.

43
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,080
Oh, my!

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,880
What do you mean?

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
Well, think about it.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Why else would a father take his son

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
to see Dr. Udom in Old Market Soi Three?

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,320
-Good heavens.
-Oh.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,000
He got a disease
from sleeping with prostitutes?

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,440
I guess so.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,360
Mei Hua…

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,240
What did the doctor say?

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,320
Just as I suspected.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
We've got the medicine.
He should be better by tomorrow.

55
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,600
If he doesn't have a fever,
he might still make the exam.

56
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,600
He already missed a day. What now?

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
I'll inform his homeroom teacher
that he's sick.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,920
They should be able to work it out.

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,680
Hopefully, it won't make him
fail or repeat the year.

60
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,320
Missing exams because of gonorrhea

61
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,320
from visiting a brothel!

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,520
It's shameful and humiliating!

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,600
You handle it.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,840
I want nothing to do with it.

65
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Go get some rest.

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,360
Yes, Dad.

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,920
Wait.

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,440
Look at me and talk to me.

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
I've lived here

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,720
since before you were born.

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,040
I don't even know the way
to that brothel behind the Old Market.

72
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
And you've spent

73
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,120
more time in Bangkok than here.

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
How do you even know about that brothel?

75
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,480
Who took you to the brothel?

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,040
Tell me who took you there!

77
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,840
Tell me!

78
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,400
Who took you there?

79
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,760
Who dragged you
to a filthy place like that?

80
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
Huh?

81
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,320
Tell me!

82
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,760
Fine. If you won't tell me,

83
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,160
I'll just assume

84
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,760
all three of you boys went
and became degenerates together.

85
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,840
I'll punish the other two just like you.

86
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000
They had nothing to do with it, Mom.

87
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,320
I went alone.

88
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
Tell me now.

89
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,800
Who did you go with?

90
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
Say it!

91
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,480
It was Chen.

92
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
It was Chen.

93
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,840
It's because of your son!

94
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,240
Dad, I'm sorry.

95
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,920
I had to protect my brothers.

96
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Go get some rest. Go on.

97
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh, hey, Korn.

98
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,240
Why did you finish your exam so early?

99
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,360
Even if I'd stayed until the time was up,

100
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
I wouldn't have been
able to make it anyway.

101
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,520
Did you manage to answer any questions?

102
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,520
Do you even have to ask?

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
You don't have an exam this afternoon?

104
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,240
I do.

105
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,800
Then why aren't you studying?

106
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
What's the point?
I won't remember any of it.

107
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
Come on. Sit down.

108
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,680
I'll tutor you.

109
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
Which subject is up next?

110
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,760
-Brother.
-Yes?

111
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
If Mom finds out
we went to the brothel with Rak,

112
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,360
we'll getting whipped for sure.

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,880
Do you think Rak will rat us out?

114
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
He won't say anything
to get us in trouble.

115
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,880
But I'm more worried about Chen.

116
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,520
If Mom finds out
he's the one who took us there…

117
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
who knows what will happen.

118
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,600
Why did you throw my stuff out?

119
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,320
That was my order.

120
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,880
Got a problem with that?

121
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,280
I should never have
let you stay in my house.

122
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,480
How could you
bite the hand that feeds you?

123
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,280
I don't understand.

124
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,920
Don't play dumb.

125
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,280
You took Rak to the brothel, didn't you?

126
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Do you know

127
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,360
Rak got infected
and missed his final exams?

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,440
If he doesn't graduate,

129
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,280
it's all your fault!

130
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,720
-I was wrong.
-I don't accept your apology.

132
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,000
You're scum.

133
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,520
I won't let you harm my son again.

134
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
Get out of my house. Now.

135
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
Mei.

136
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,640
Don't say a word.

137
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,280
You brought a snake into the house.

138
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,320
Get off my property

139
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,840
and stay away from my sons.

140
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,000
If you defy me,

141
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,560
I'll fire you from the mill

142
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,360
and leave you
to rot like a dog in the street.

143
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,240
Let's go.

144
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,720
I'll help you find a rental place.

145
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,640
Do you feel better now?

146
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
I feel a bit better, Mom.

147
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Then go review your lessons.

148
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
You have exams tomorrow.

149
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,800
Stay in your room.

150
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Study and don't go anywhere.

151
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Yes, Mom.

152
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,640
-Chanraem.
-Yes, ma'am?

153
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,280
I'm going to Madam Prakai's luncheon.

154
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,040
You watch the door.

155
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,000
If Rak leaves the room,

156
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll deal with you.

157
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,720
This is not too big or small.
It's easy to maintain.

159
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
It's suitable for you.

160
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
Is this your house?

161
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,000
A friend's. They're renting it out.

162
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,840
Great. Now Madam can't throw me out again.

163
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,520
Dad, I didn't mean to hurt the boys.

164
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,880
I just wanted to make friends.

165
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
I saw he liked those nude magazines,

166
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,200
so I took him out to impress him.

167
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,000
I didn't expect

168
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,040
he'd catch something.

169
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,640
Let it go.

170
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,600
Learn your lesson.

171
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,560
Don't do it again.

172
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,240
I won't, Dad.

173
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,840
Can you let go
of your dream to continue studying?

174
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,360
Why are you asking me that?

175
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,440
I want you to work instead.

176
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
Your brothers haven't finished school.

177
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
This is a chance for me

178
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
to support you.

179
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
Will Madam agree?

180
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,360
Even if Mei disagrees,

181
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,840
you're still my flesh and blood.

182
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,400
It's better than having
someone else's kids

183
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,760
take over our family business.

184
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,160
I doubt she sees it that way.

185
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,080
But it's still more likely

186
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,720
than you going back to school.

187
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,680
Think about it.

188
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,920
Then let me know.

189
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,400
Come on, let's check the upstairs.

190
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,360
Good afternoon, everyone.

191
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,440
Good afternoon.

192
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,760
Good afternoon.

193
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Where's Madam Prakai?

194
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh, the maid said
she's upstairs in the prayer room.

195
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,480
But she'll be down shortly.

196
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,280
Anyway,

197
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,880
have you heard about Madam Mei's son?

198
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,000
My goodness, it's so shameful.

199
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,680
If it were me,
I wouldn't know how to face society.

200
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,960
What is it?

201
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,480
Well,

202
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,440
someone saw

203
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,640
her eldest son

204
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,880
at Dr. Udom's clinic in Soi Three
by the Old Market.

205
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,640
No way! Dr. Udom

206
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,040
treats men who've caught diseases
from prostitutes, doesn't he?

207
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,320
And today's a final exam day too, right?

208
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,920
Doesn't your son go to the same school?

209
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,720
You should ask your son

210
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,400
if the boy showed up for exams.

211
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,240
If he missed his final exams,

212
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,920
he'll have to repeat the year for sure.

213
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
See?

214
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
What kind of parenting is that?

215
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
He's still very young,

216
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,600
and she let him go to a brothel.

217
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
Madam.

218
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
Nosy.

219
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,040
Madam.

220
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,320
Madam Mei.

221
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
Mom, I don't want to repeat a year.

222
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm feeling better now.
I'll take the exam tomorrow.

223
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,160
So you want to ruin your record?

224
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,600
What people say

225
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,840
is nothing but rumors.

226
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,960
But a doctor's certificate

227
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,680
is proof

228
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,120
that you caught a disease from a brothel.

229
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,200
I've made my decision.

230
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
You'll repeat the year with Wee.

231
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,080
When the school year ends,

232
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,800
the rumors will die down.

233
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
Or you can just transfer schools.

234
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,800
-Dad.
-Even your dad can't help you.

235
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,040
If you're angry

236
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,480
about repeating a year,

237
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,160
be angry at yourself

238
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
for calling Chen your brother.

239
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,960
Do you even know what he is?

240
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,320
He was born from your father's lust.

241
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,520
And you're stupid enough
to treat him like real family.

242
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,720
All of you are fools.

243
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,320
Mom!

244
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,120
Mom!

245
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,760
Mom!

246
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,720
Dad, I…

247
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,680
Just do what your mother says.

248
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,720
Exams are over!

249
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,920
Korn! Now the room's a mess!

250
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm done, Brother! I'm done with exams!

251
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,360
-I'm free!
-Get down. You're heavy!

252
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,280
Yay!

253
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm done with the exams!

254
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,000
Make-up exams are mid-month.

255
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,960
Come on.

256
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,160
You ruined the moment.

257
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,840
Look at this mess.

258
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,840
I'm going to the movies
with friends tomorrow.

259
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,880
Do you want to come?

260
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,640
No, I already have plans.

261
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,680
Mr. Rak.

262
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,000
Mr. Rak.

263
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,680
Wake up.

264
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,480
It's time for breakfast.

265
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Wake up now, Mr. Rak.

266
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,160
Mr. Rak, wake up.

267
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,720
Mr. Rak.

268
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,200
It's time to wake up.

269
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,560
Mr. Rak, it's time to wake up.

270
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,040
So pale…

271
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
Time to get up, Mr. Rak.

272
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,400
It's time to get up,

273
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
Mr. Rak.

274
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,160
Mr. Rak?

275
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
No, Mr. Rak.

276
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,200
Can I help you with anything?

277
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
No, thank you.

278
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,760
You can tell me anything. Don't be shy.

279
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,720
I was just about to buy a drink.

280
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,000
Let me get it for you.
What would you like?

281
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,880
Anything is fine.

282
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,200
All right, just a moment.

283
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,360
Hey, you.

284
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
Are you that thirsty?

285
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
Ranee!

286
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,120
I can't swim!

287
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,320
Ranee!

288
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,480
-Ranee!
-I can't swim!

289
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,680
Help! Someone's drowning!

290
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,120
Help!

291
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,440
-What should we do?
-Help!

292
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,480
Help!

293
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,680
Someone's drowning!

294
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Ranee!

295
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,200
That's where she went in.

296
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,640
Chan!

297
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,880
Chan!

298
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,800
Where are you?

299
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,200
Are you upstairs?

300
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Yes, Auntie.

301
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,280
Meet me again in the afternoon.

302
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,800
Dad and Mom are picking up my brothers
in Bangkok. They'll be home late.

303
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
Chan!

304
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll try.

305
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,360
Chan!

306
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,600
Yes, Auntie.

307
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm cleaning the room.
Do you need anything?

308
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Come help me in the kitchen!

309
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,960
All right.

310
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,520
Bye.

311
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,720
Chanraem Trongpanich.

312
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,760
Why are you trying to get up so quickly?

313
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm fine now.

314
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Are you sure you're okay?

315
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Yeah, just got water in my ears.
It felt dizzy for a bit,

316
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,000
but I'm fine now.

317
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,640
Thank you.

318
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,920
If you hadn't saved me,

319
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
I'd be at the bottom
of the river right now.

320
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,120
Then from now on,
I have to be by your side at all times…

321
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,680
so if anything happens,

322
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,480
I can save you.

323
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,920
-See you next semester!
-Okay.

324
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,040
There he comes.

325
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,160
We could've waited until they finished
their make-up exams to pick them up.

326
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,440
So we don't have to come again.

327
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,160
Good day, Dad, Mom!

328
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,120
-Hello.
-Hello.

329
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,560
Where's your brother?

330
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,400
He went out with friends.
He's not back yet.

331
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,920
Rawee? Out with friends?

332
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,880
Girls or boys?

333
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,560
Mom, it's an all-boys school.

334
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm worried he went out
with some girl from another school.

335
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,480
Rak has me paranoid now.

336
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,480
It should be all right.

337
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
He'll be here. He's punctual.

338
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,440
Do you want me to teach you how to swim?

339
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,880
You really should know how.

340
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,040
If something like this happens again,
you'll be able to help yourself.

341
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,120
Let me think about it.

342
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,560
I don't fully trust the instructor.

343
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,560
Here,

344
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,040
a T-shirt and some shorts.

345
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Thanks.

346
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,400
I'll go get changed first.

347
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,080
Excuse me.

348
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,600
Mr. Squid Boy is kind of cute, right?

349
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,560
Can I have him?

350
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,440
Why are you asking me?

351
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,560
You're jealous, huh?

352
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm not!

353
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,760
Anyway, does Mr. Squid Boy
have an older or younger brother?

354
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,080
Introduce us, please!

355
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,640
I'll take one.

356
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,520
You girls!

357
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,120
Ranee!

358
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Are you all right, dear?

359
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,120
I'm feeling better now, Auntie.

360
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
-Hello, Auntie.
-Hello.

361
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,040
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

362
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,320
So, which one of you
jumped in to save Ranee?

363
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,280
She already left.

364
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,280
Really?

365
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
That's too bad I missed her.

366
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,680
Please thank her for me when you see her.

367
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,920
Sure. We'll get going now.

368
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,160
-All right.
-Goodbye.

369
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,040
Take care, girls.

370
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,240
Here, go get changed.

371
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,520
-I'll go settle the hospital bill.
-Yes.

372
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,200
H… Hello.

373
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
He looks so familiar.

374
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,120
Auntie, I want to go home now.

375
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,640
I'll go settle the bill.
Just go get changed.

376
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,640
Please help me.

377
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,880
To help you change?

378
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,480
-Yes.
-Come on, you're a grown-up now.

379
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,560
Dad, Mom.

380
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
I finished that guitar chord!

381
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,600
I'll play it for you now.

382
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,160
You must have spent
your study time on this, right?

383
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,320
Come on.

384
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Looks like we've got
a musician in the family.

385
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,680
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

386
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
All right.

387
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,680
-Here's the money.
-Thank you.

388
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,400
-Please come back again.
-Sure.

389
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
What would you like?

390
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,080
Hey?

391
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,760
Hey?

392
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm here to buy some pork.

393
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,200
Your face looks familiar.

394
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,280
You're working
at Master Jiw's rice mill, right?

395
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,640
Yes.

396
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,840
I heard a rumor…

397
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,040
that you're the son
of Master Jiw's former wife. Is that true?

398
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,640
Yes.

399
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,960
That explains why you're so handsome…

400
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,760
just like Mr. Rawee.

401
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,200
So what would you like?

402
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,520
Hello? How much pork do you want?

403
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,960
Mr. Rak, no!

404
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,680
You'll spill the food.

405
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,600
Please let go.

406
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,200
You're all dressed up. Are you going out?

407
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,040
Yes.

408
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,360
I won't let you go.

409
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,720
I can't, Mr. Rak.
I have plans with friends.

410
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,040
How can your friend
be more important than me?

411
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,520
I'll be back soon.

412
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
Mr. Rak!

413
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,720
I can't wait for just one more minute!

414
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,520
Mr. Rak!

415
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,080
Mom and Dad will be back soon .

416
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,040
We won't get to be
together like this again.

417
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,440
Please skip your plans with your friends.

418
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,520
I love you.

419
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,600
LOVE AND DESIRE: YOUNG LADY

420
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
Everything's delicious, Dad.

421
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,639
Eat as much as you like.

422
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,400
I wish Rak could've joined us.

423
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,639
He doesn't deserve to.

424
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,920
He rushed into things

425
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,840
and set a bad example for his brothers.

426
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,360
Now he's repeating a year.

427
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,000
You shouldn't have brought it up.
You ruined the mood.

428
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm sorry.

429
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,920
Then eat more so your mouth stays busy.

430
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,800
You two,

431
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,440
don't follow in your brother's footsteps.

432
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,080
There's no need to rush
into love and romance.

433
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,800
I'll choose suitable wives for you two.

434
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,960
Don't worry that you won't have a wife.

435
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,720
A lot of girls in town

436
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,680
are lining up to be part of this family.

437
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,320
If you two

438
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,160
behave like your brother,

439
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,320
I won't let you continue your studies.

440
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,360
Do you understand?

441
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,080
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Mom.

442
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Let's just eat. The food's getting cold.

443
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,840
Yes, Dad.

444
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,560
What now, Korn?

445
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,520
What happened earlier today?
You came back dressed like that.

446
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,640
I fell into the water,
so I had to buy new clothes.

447
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,200
Fell into the water? How?

448
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,000
I helped someone who was drowning.
Stop questioning me.

449
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
Who were you out with?

450
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I saw your friends eating near the cinema.

451
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,000
I…

452
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,880
Don't tell me

453
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,920
you pulled the same stunt as Rak.

454
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,680
Are you crazy? I just met her!

455
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,640
So you went with a girl?

456
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,520
Yes.

457
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,000
Ranee, right?

458
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,040
You should study law.

459
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
You solved the case.

460
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,480
Madam Chanraem, the first daughter-in-law.

461
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm so lucky.

462
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,200
Help me!

463
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,360
Tub!

464
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,720
Why didn't you show up?

465
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Mr. Rak had a fever.

466
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,840
I couldn't just leave him.
Madam would've scolded me.

467
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,960
But she's not even home yet.

468
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,840
She will be soon.

469
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,400
Then come grab something to eat with me.

470
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
Let's go.

471
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,720
Hurry up.

472
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Here I am, miss!

473
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,920
Keep your voice down!

474
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,400
All right.

475
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,080
Don't forget your way back home.

476
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,640
Got it.

477
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,840
Watch for traffic!

478
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,040
Have you waited long?

479
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,840
I could wait even longer.

480
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,720
Then don't complain
when I make you wait in the future.

481
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,640
What if I say I miss you instead?

482
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,360
Cha-aim.

483
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,440
Yes, ma'am?

484
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,560
Where's Ranee?

485
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
Well,

486
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,200
she went to horseback riding practice.

487
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,200
Chanraem.

488
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,640
Mr. Rak?

489
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,920
Come with me. You can finish this later.

490
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,120
Where to?

491
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
Just come.

492
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,120
Mr. Rak, wait!

493
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,440
Hurry up.

494
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,520
Mr. Rak!

495
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,280
No, someone might see.

496
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,480
No one will.

497
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,800
Mr. Rak, no!

498
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,240
Mr. Rak.

499
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Where's Ranee?

500
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,680
Pardon me?

501
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,240
Where's Ranee? I was told
she was here for horseback riding.

502
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes.

503
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,120
So where is she?

504
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,240
She went back already.

505
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,880
How's that possible?
I just came from the house.

506
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,920
I asked where she is.

507
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,080
-Chen!
-Long time no see.

508
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,480
I just finished my exams.
Where did you move to?

509
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,200
Around the New Market.

510
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,080
Where were you just now?

511
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,280
I was out for a bike ride.

512
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,560
Who did you go with?

513
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,280
Don't tell me you went alone.

514
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,000
I saw you with a girl.

515
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,760
If I remember correctly,

516
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,800
she went to the hotel
with the woman your mom dislikes.

517
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Please don't tell Mom.

518
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,520
If you want me to keep my mouth shut,

519
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,840
we need to make a deal.

520
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,240
Tell me what you want.

521
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,640
I'll do anything.

522
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,680
I know you saw us.

523
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,320
Why did you do that?

524
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,880
What if Mom finds out?

525
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,600
She won't…

526
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,680
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

527
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
Of course, I won't say a word.

528
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,960
Good.

529
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,600
Is this really a good idea

530
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,160
after what just happened?

531
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,560
What's wrong with it?

532
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,120
I don't need to pay to go to the brothel.

533
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
But she already has a boyfriend.

534
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,640
I'm not taking her away from anyone.

535
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,120
She wanted it too.

536
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,120
We're just sharing some pleasure.

537
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,200
Do you like her?

538
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,520
I'm not dumb enough
to take a housemaid as my wife.

539
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,160
Don't forget

540
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,320
to keep it all quiet.

541
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,120
Horseback riding took a while today.

542
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,160
The weather was nice,
so I lost track of time.

543
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,800
I'm going up to shower now.

544
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,840
All right.

545
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,840
The stall's closed now.

546
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,400
Mr. Rawee!

547
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,280
Are you here to buy pork?

548
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,240
No.

549
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,040
Do you want to go for a walk?

550
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,920
Do you have a boyfriend?

551
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,080
That's pretty direct of you.

552
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm asking
because I need to know for sure.

553
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,360
Not yet.
I'm still waiting for my soulmate.

554
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,400
I've already found mine.

555
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,360
But my brother hasn't.

556
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,440
He's liked you
since the first time he saw you,

557
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,240
so he wanted me to introduce you to him.

558
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,840
Which brother?

559
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,400
Well.

560
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,440
It's you.

561
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,240
My job's done.

562
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,040
I'm heading home.

563
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,560
Don't forget your promise.

564
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,680
Shall we keep walking?

565
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,040
I'd really like to get to know you.

566
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,840
Where've you been all day?

567
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,520
I went for a bike ride, Mom.

568
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,240
You've got too much time on your hands.

569
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,400
You'll work at the mill during the break.

570
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,480
But Chen's already working there.

571
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,160
You want your father
to hand it over to him?

572
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,000
Ask your dad to let you work there.

573
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,280
Show him you want it.

574
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,240
-I don't even like--
-You have to like it!

575
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,480
Don't be a fool.

576
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,960
You want your inheritance or not?

577
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,600
I already planned it.
You'll take the mill.

578
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,440
Rak will handle the hotel.

579
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,200
And Korn gets the market and rentals.

580
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,320
I won't let anything

581
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,520
fall into Chen's hands.

582
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,080
Not even a cent.

583
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,520
I've decided, Dad.

584
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,200
I won't continue school.

585
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,840
You've made the right decision.

586
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,160
But how long do I have to be a laborer

587
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,640
before I get a proper position?

588
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,960
Be patient.

589
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,920
I want you to know everything

590
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,040
about the business first.

591
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,840
I hope it doesn't take too long.

592
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,200
Why?

593
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,480
I want to get married.

594
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,840
You found someone?

595
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,320
But I'm worried her family
will look down on me

596
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,760
and won't accept me.

597
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,200
Who is it? Do I know her?

598
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,120
Her name is Hongyok.
She sells pork in the New Market.

599
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,840
I see. Hongyok.

600
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,120
I know her family well.

601
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,800
They'd love to marry into our family.

602
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,440
If I say the word,
you can marry her right away.

603
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,160
Really, Dad?

604
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Just make sure she's the one.

605
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,160
Whenever you're ready, just tell me.

606
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,160
Thank you, Dad.

607
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,400
You've got a good eye.

608
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,480
Her family's hardworking
and financially stable.

609
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,000
She won't bring you trouble.

610
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,560
<i>Move a bit closer, please.</i>

611
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,360
Would you like to hold hands
or put an arm around each other?

612
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,560
No,

613
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,920
-just smiling is enough.
-Got it.

614
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,960
Today's portrait is for you.

615
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,240
Next time, it'll be for me.

616
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,160
Let me hold your hand next time.

617
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,320
Please stay still.

618
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,480
Look straight at me.

619
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,600
Got it.

620
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,920
Stay still.

621
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,640
Let's meet at the market this evening.

622
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,400
Let's go for a walk.

623
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,320
I'll try to go.

624
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,720
Give this to Cha-aim.

625
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,720
Don't say a word that I've read it.

626
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,360
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,400
Remember our deal?

628
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,120
Holding hands this time.

629
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,600
When did I ever agree?

630
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,960
You didn't say no. That counts as a yes.

631
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,640
Sneaky.

632
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,000
This posture? Just stay still.

633
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,680
Okay.

634
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,080
Ranee!

635
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,080
Auntie.

636
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,560
Come home now.

637
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,800
Come home with me!

638
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,200
Come!

639
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,560
If you two hadn't played
matchmaker for that boy,

640
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,200
Ranee wouldn't have met him.

641
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,840
It's my fault, Madam.

642
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,120
I'm sorry, Madam.

643
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,080
Please don't blame them, Auntie.

644
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,600
Rawee and I…

645
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,000
met back in Bangkok.

646
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,440
Ranee.

647
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm so disappointed in you.

648
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,600
Why are you
thinking about love at your age?

649
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,960
Why don't you focus
on your responsibilities?

650
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,240
Madam, she's always been

651
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,160
top of her class every year.

652
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,640
How long have you two been dating?

653
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,040
We just met.

654
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,320
You just met,

655
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,520
and you're holding hands in public?

656
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,200
Ranee!

657
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,160
Why?

658
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
You know full well

659
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,160
he's Mei's son.

660
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,720
She's my sworn enemy!

661
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,280
Do you want her to laugh in my face?

662
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,240
His mother is rotten,

663
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,360
and the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

664
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,360
I'm sure

665
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,320
that boy has
no good intentions toward you.

666
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,680
Auntie…

667
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,840
Rawee saved me from drowning.

668
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,600
If not for him,

669
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,400
I wouldn't be alive right now.

670
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,680
So, the one I saw that day

671
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,560
was really Rawee.

672
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,720
Yes.

673
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,040
He saved me and took me to the hospital.

674
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,680
Rak!

675
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,760
You bastard!

676
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,240
What happened? What did my son do?

677
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,520
Your son got my girlfriend pregnant.

678
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,880
Don't expect me to accept
a slut like you as my daughter-in-law.

679
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,160
Never!

680
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,120
<i>I won't give up so easily.</i>

681
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,560
You don't know who I am.

682
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,880
I'm sending all three of you

683
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,240
to study abroad.

684
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,320
