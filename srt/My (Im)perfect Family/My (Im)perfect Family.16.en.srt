1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,280
The hotel's lively today.

2
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
It's going to get even livelier.

3
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,360
The competitor hotel has terrible service,

4
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,400
not worth the price.

5
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,720
And I must thank you and Dad
for helping fund my hotel.

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
It's Chomechawee.

7
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
Am I really going to be a father?

8
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,760
<i>Now that he's got the inheritance,</i>
<i>he wants to move somewhere else?</i>

9
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,200
<i>I don't know when he'll leave.</i>

10
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,720
Then we act tomorrow
before it's too late.

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,280
That mother and son
will pay for what they did to me.

12
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,000
You'd better find a way to warn Rak.

13
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Tub and Chanraem are suspicious.

14
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,280
Let's go intercept them
in front of the Master's house.

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Not sure if we'll make it in time.

16
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,840
We will. His wife sleeps in late.

17
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Wait! Wait for me!

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
Can I catch a ride to the market with you?

19
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,680
Can't you bike there?

20
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,640
The tire's flat.
Madam needs to cook and make merit.

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,440
We're also in a rush.

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Then just drop me off
anywhere along the way.

23
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
What are you two up to?

24
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,960
Some kind of secret?
Is that why I can't come?

25
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,760
Just get in the car.

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
Thanks.

27
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,440
We can drop her off first.
She might come in handy as a witness.

28
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Why hasn't he called yet?
I have things to do.

29
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
Maybe there are a lot of patients.

30
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,160
- It's probably Mr. Rak.
- No, I'll get it.

31
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,160
Hello, Rak? What did the doctor say?

32
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,240
It's Rawee.

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,760
What do you want?

34
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,480
I need to speak to Rak.

35
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,720
He's not here.

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Where is he?

37
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Ngor, you talk to him.

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,519
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
Yes, Young Master?

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,280
Ngor, do you know where Rak went?

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,080
<i>He took Ms. Duangporn to the hospital</i>
<i>to check if she's pregnant.</i>

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,280
Which hospital? When did he go?

43
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,760
All right, that's all for now.

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,160
Is something wrong?

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,600
Rak took Duangporn
to get a pregnancy test.

46
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,280
I'll go find them at the hospital.

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
I'll come with you.

48
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
You should stay here.
You didn't sleep much last night.

49
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,200
I'll call you later.

50
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,560
Be careful.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,680
HENG SENG

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
Miss told me to stall them
as long as possible.

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,840
We're at the market.

54
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
What do I do now?

55
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,240
Are you asleep or what?
We're here. Get down.

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
I've got errands to run.

57
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,200
Ouch…

58
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,880
Ugh, it really hurts…

59
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
What's wrong?

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
I've had a stomachache since last night.
I think…

61
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,720
my appendix is going to burst.

62
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
It really hurts.

63
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
What happened?

64
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,920
She says she's got a stomachache.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,520
Can you take me to the hospital?

66
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,640
The hospital is nearby.
Let's just take her.

67
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,440
Thank you.

68
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Now we can finally brag
we're having a baby!

69
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,080
I think the baby's been waiting for this.

70
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,920
Watch your step.
I'll open the door for you.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,040
Tub, that's Rak and his wife.

72
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Luck is on our side.

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,560
We owe Cha-aim for this.

74
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,880
Shit…

75
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,360
What do I do now?

76
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,760
Oh, my.

77
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm screwed. What do I do now?

78
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,720
Mr. Rawee!

79
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,280
Cha-aim? What are you doing here?

80
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,320
Mr. Rawee, follow them.
Tub just went after Mr. Rak.

81
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,080
Thanks.

82
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,080
If you notice anything suspicious,
call me immediately.

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,720
Any updates?

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,880
Rawee isn't hiring anyone yet.

85
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,920
He said he'll wait another month.

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,440
How will they have enough staff?

87
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,800
He gives them monetary incentives.

88
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,160
He's offering extra overtime pay.

89
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,360
They're going to fight
over shifts at this rate.

90
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
I heard it's fully booked for months.

91
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,480
No need for new hires.

92
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,160
So that means
they had way too many staff before.

93
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,880
Even after people quit,
the hotel's still running fine.

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,800
So basically, we helped him cut costs.

95
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,480
He always finds a way
to counter our moves.

96
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,280
But why wait a whole month?

97
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Running shifts like this,
the staff won't be able to take it.

98
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
I've got no clue.

99
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,159
Just prepare to counter him.

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm heading to the gold shop.
I haven't been in days.

101
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,600
GIM HUAN HENG JEWELRY

102
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Let's go.

103
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
They're probably here
to find things to sell in Bangkok.

104
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,720
What do we do now?

105
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,440
Wait for the right moment.

106
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,080
Is this really Madam Mei's special price?
Could you lower it a bit more?

107
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,720
This is almost at cost already.
Give me some profit.

108
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,520
You bargain like a pro,
just like your mom.

109
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,160
Here you go.

110
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,240
I'll lock the price for you.

111
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,080
When you open the shop,
come pick it up and pay for the rest.

112
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,480
Thank you.

113
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,440
May I borrow your phone to call my mom?
Maybe she'll pay the deposit.

114
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,840
The phone's over there.
But let me talk to her after you.

115
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,040
Of course.

116
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Mr. Rak, I'm hungry.

117
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I'll go wait at that pork leg rice place.

118
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,200
The one through the alley
near the parking lot?

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Yes, that one.

120
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,600
All right. I'll catch up.

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,720
All right.

122
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,080
She's alone, Tub.

123
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,760
Today's really our lucky day.

124
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
Your chance for revenge is here.

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,440
I'll follow her.

126
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll meet you at the car.

127
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
- Oh?
- Quiet!

128
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,600
Don't turn around.

129
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Please don't hurt me.

130
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm pregnant.

131
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,240
If you care about your baby, come with me.

132
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,560
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't ask.

133
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,000
One wrong move and I'll stab you.

134
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
Walk!

135
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,760
Go!

136
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,680
Just let me know how much money you want.

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,320
Just don't hurt me.

138
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
Stop talking.

139
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,560
You're annoying. Just walk.

140
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,880
- Help!
- Shut up, unless you want to get hurt.

141
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Where are you taking me?

142
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
If you cooperate,

143
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
you'll be safe.

144
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,000
She's pregnant.

145
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,400
The price will be even better.

146
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,880
Go, get in the car.

147
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
Mr. Rawee. What should we do?

148
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,080
If he wants to get hurt, that's on him.

149
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Please move.

150
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,360
For our friendship's sake,

151
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,320
I don't want trouble with you.

152
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,720
She's my sister-in-law.
How can you expect me to just stand by?

153
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,160
And when your mother and brother
wronged Chanraem,

154
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,480
you stood by just fine.

155
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,960
But now that it's happening to you,
it's unacceptable?

156
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Please move.

157
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,200
Why are you taking her?

158
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,000
Are you planning
to make her miscarry for revenge?

159
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
We're not as cruel as your mother.

160
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,760
Then what do you want? Just tell me.

161
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
If I can give it, I'll repay you
on behalf of Mom and Rak.

162
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,320
Is it compensation money?

163
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,960
And if it is,
would you really pay it on their behalf?

164
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
Yes.

165
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
I inherited just as much as Rak.

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Just tell me how much. I'll pay it myself.

167
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,680
But I have one condition.

168
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
You and Chan have to move out of here

169
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,440
and let this whole grudge

170
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,840
end with this payment.

171
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,720
If you promise to keep your word,
I'll pay right away.

172
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,200
Today's incident will stay between us.

173
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
You two can start fresh somewhere else.

174
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,800
Name your price.

175
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,880
You should know how I am.
I'm not a tricky person.

176
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,320
I say what I mean, and I keep my word.

177
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,960
Rawee? Are you here to help me?

178
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,800
Who took me?

179
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,320
Mr. Rak!

180
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
- Mr. Rak!
- Duangporn.

181
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,600
- Help me.
- What's wrong?

182
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Calm down.

183
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,480
It's all right now.

184
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm here now.

185
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
It's all right.

186
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,920
What happened?

187
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,760
Someone kidnapped me.

188
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
They probably wanted
to demand a ransom from you.

189
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Who? Who did it?

190
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,920
I don't know.

191
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,360
How did you escape?

192
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,960
I think…

193
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Rawee helped me.

194
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
Rawee?

195
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,440
Yes.

196
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,720
Are you sure? Where is he now?

197
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,120
I didn't see him either.

198
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,800
But…

199
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I heard them call his name.

200
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,320
It could've been a different Rawee.

201
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,240
If it was really him,
he would've shown himself.

202
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
But…

203
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,920
why did they let you go so easily
without asking for a ransom?

204
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,200
I don't know.

205
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,600
Mr. Rak,

206
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,280
let's move to Bangkok as soon as possible.

207
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,760
If I stay here,

208
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm scared to even go out alone now.

209
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Okay. I'll do everything I can
to get us to Bangkok as soon as possible.

210
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
It's all right. You're safe now.

211
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,640
Let's go home.

212
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
Yes.

213
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Sorry I got up late today.

214
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,320
I couldn't sleep last night. I was
too excited about the building purchase.

215
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Should we go now?
I can grab something to eat outside.

216
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,440
What if we lease instead of buy?
Would the owner agree?

217
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,319
What?

218
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,839
I'm worried. What if the bar fails?

219
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,200
Pouring everything into it is too risky.

220
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,079
If we lease it for ten years

221
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,880
and things don't go well,
we can always pass it on.

222
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,000
I guess we can ask.

223
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
Then… shall we go now?

224
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,320
Lease?

225
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
Why the sudden change of heart?

226
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,120
That witch Mei must be behind this.

227
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,040
How are you, dear? Did you get any rest?

228
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
Of course, I did.

229
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,320
It's good you love your husband
and want to help.

230
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
It's your duty as a wife, I know.

231
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,560
But don't forget, you're pregnant.

232
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,680
Your duty as a mother matters too.

233
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
- Yes, Auntie.
- Madam!

234
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,840
- Madam!
- What?

235
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
Tub and Chan are gone.

236
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,880
- They took everything.
- Oh?

237
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,840
But they left a letter.

238
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,160
They didn't take the stuff this morning?

239
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,800
No, I was in the truck bed all alone.

240
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
What does it say?

241
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
Tub apologized for leaving suddenly.

242
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,840
Did he say why?

243
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,360
Miss, it's Mr. Rawee on the phone.

244
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,280
Why did he change his mind?
We already settled this.

245
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,120
I don't know either.
Now I can't even buy the outfit I wanted.

246
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,440
By the way, let me ask you something.

247
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,800
I don't understand.
What's this leasing thing?

248
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,000
Will the building be in my name?

249
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,520
Leasing means you don't own it.
It still belongs to the original owner.

250
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,680
But if the bar doesn't do well,

251
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,280
you can find someone
to take over the lease.

252
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,760
So basically,
I just get to name the place.

253
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
Are you planning
to name it after yourself?

254
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,440
No way. It's not even my building anymore.

255
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
KLAI KRUNG

256
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,120
Thank you so much.

257
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Let's take a picture.

258
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
I'm here to congratulate you.

259
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,960
How's it going?

260
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,120
- Hey.
- Congrats, man.

261
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,640
Thanks!

262
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,120
Tonight, no sneaking out
before the bar closes, okay?

263
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,480
Sure.

264
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,520
- Let's take a picture.
- All right.

265
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,360
- Excuse me, sir.
- This way, please.

266
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,840
Do you have a seat?

267
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,240
No, I'm just here
to leave this for Mr. Ronnakorn.

268
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,720
Sure. Do you want a photo?

269
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Just the gift is fine.

270
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Shall I say who it's from?

271
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's smile.

272
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,720
- Come on.
- All right.

273
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
That's nice.

274
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,720
Smile more. Nice.

275
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,880
‪One, two, three.

276
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,360
All right. One, two, three.

277
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
- Is it good?
- Yes.

278
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,240
Why so quick?

279
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,760
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

280
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,800
What did Korn say?

281
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Well…

282
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
He said thanks.

283
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,840
See?

284
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,960
I told you he has no issue with you.

285
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,440
He loves you so much.

286
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,360
He's just upset about Dad.

287
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,360
Let's go home. You need rest.

288
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,760
Do you want to check the cinema?
It's right past the alley.

289
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
Sure.

290
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,640
Let's go.

291
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,320
So, did you get a premiere date?

292
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,800
I got a few options.

293
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,280
I'm thinking about asking your mom first.

294
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,720
Good.

295
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,480
That way she won't say
you're ignoring her.

296
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,320
- Yes.
- Let's go.

297
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Breakfast is ready, ma'am.

298
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,760
Good. I'm starving.

299
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,960
Ma'am, Mr. Korn's bar is quite the hit.

300
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,080
Everyone at the market's talking about it.

301
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,760
They say the singer is beautiful
and has a great voice.

302
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,040
I hope the hype lasts.

303
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm afraid it will flop like the last one.

304
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,040
Maybe he already broke even.

305
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,000
I heard you need
to reserve seats in advance.

306
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,640
Otherwise, you won't get a table.

307
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,840
I hope it's true.

308
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,800
At least he won't feel left behind.

309
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,080
He can be proud he built it himself,

310
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
instead of just living off others

311
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
and acting all proud

312
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,360
like Rawee.

313
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,800
Hello, Ms. Hongyok.

314
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,800
Long time no see.

315
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,160
I've been busy helping Chen.

316
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440
The hotel just opened.
Things aren't settled yet.

317
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Are you looking for jewelry for an event?

318
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,720
Yes.

319
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,480
But we don't have much stock now.

320
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Everything's been reserved.

321
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
Oh, dear.

322
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,800
Which factory owner
beat me to it this time?

323
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,240
Wait, you haven't heard?

324
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,840
Madam Mei's eldest son and his wife

325
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,480
are opening a jewelry store in Bangkok.

326
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,560
That madam is investing too,
just because Duangporn is pregnant.

327
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
Luck seems to always favor them.

328
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,320
Also, Korn's bar is packed every night.

329
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,240
I heard you have
to reserve a table in advance.

330
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,000
It's frustrating. You're a son too,

331
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,200
yet you got nothing.
You had to start from scratch.

332
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,600
Good thing you had the wit

333
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,280
to embezzle what should've been yours.

334
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,680
Otherwise, would we even be here?

335
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
I can't just sit by

336
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,320
and watch those three brothers succeed.

337
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,360
Me neither.

338
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Especially Mei.

339
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,480
I don't want to see her smile,

340
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,320
not even for a day.

341
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,280
Auntie listed some auspicious days

342
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,400
for the cinema's grand opening.

343
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,280
I would like you to also have a look.

344
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
I'd like both
Thai and Chinese auspicious days.

345
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,280
Scratch the first one.

346
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
It's not a good day?

347
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
It is. It's a very good day.

348
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,160
Then why scratch it?

349
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,160
Because that's the day Rak opens his
jewelry store in Bangkok. I have to go.

350
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,760
So you'll travel all the way to Bangkok…

351
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
for Rak's store.

352
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,880
My bar is just around the corner,

353
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,160
and you haven't gone.

354
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm old.

355
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,840
How can you expect me
to go to a night event?

356
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,440
You could've at least called.

357
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,640
You know I don't support that.

358
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,000
Should I wish you luck in failing then?

359
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,640
What did you come for? To pick a fight?

360
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,520
I came to get my gold, my inheritance.

361
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,400
Didn't you say your bar's booming?

362
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,680
You need reservations to go there?

363
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,120
And now you need to sell your gold?

364
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,040
I don't have an investor like Rak.

365
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,080
He's got capital

366
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,440
and liquidity.

367
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,440
Who told you that?

368
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,560
It's all over town.

369
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
I guess

370
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
you only have one son.

371
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,960
Maybe Rawee and I

372
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,320
are sons of another woman, just like Chen.

373
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,240
Korn, it's good you're here.

374
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,080
Please help pick
the opening date for the cinema.

375
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,160
Which day can you go?

376
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,960
I cannot.

377
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
I never planned to go anyway.

378
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,680
Some people are so clueless.

379
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,040
You know he's upset about it,

380
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,480
yet you still invite him?

381
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,200
Just give me the gold.
I have other errands to do.

382
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,240
Just take part of it. I don't want you
to waste it all and bother me later.

383
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,520
Follow me.

384
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,960
Rawee was really happy

385
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,240
that you welcomed him warmly
on opening night.

386
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,080
He thought long and hard
about going there.

387
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,040
He was afraid you'd reject him.

388
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,040
He didn't want to get hurt.

389
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,080
He really loves and cares about you.

390
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,000
If he really cared,

391
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,560
he'd have given me the cinema.

392
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,520
There's no need to hide behind Dad's will.

393
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Then let's run it together?

394
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Isn't it too late now?

395
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,360
Actually,

396
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,840
I belong in a bar.

397
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
There's music

398
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
and instruments.

399
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,920
Just don't ruin my dad's dream.

400
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,240
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

401
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,720
Mr. Chen's right-hand man at the mill
is the deputy manager.

402
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,320
He was loyal to the old master
but switched sides.

403
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,840
Mr. Chen trusts him a lot.

404
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,480
No matter who we put in charge,
it doesn't look like it's going to work.

405
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,360
Mr. Chen's men are everywhere.

406
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,760
Did you get a list of those loyal to Chen?

407
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,880
Yes.

408
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,480
I printed it as you asked.

409
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,800
Then leak this document.

410
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,520
Excuse me?

411
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,120
Leak it. Spread rumors these names
are blacklisted and will be let go

412
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
with compensation immediately.

413
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,120
Are you sure?

414
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,240
They might protest, like at the hotel.

415
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,160
Just do what I said.

416
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,160
When they see an example,
they'll realize it.

417
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,160
Just like what you dreamed of?

418
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,640
Yes.

419
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,040
I can't believe

420
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,320
it's been less than three weeks.

421
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,880
It's like magic.

422
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
If you have money,

423
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,680
anything's possible.

424
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,120
We're so lucky.

425
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,920
The baby came at the perfect time.

426
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
We got a big fund from your mom.

427
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,080
Otherwise,
we'd have to spend your inheritance.

428
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,360
Once the baby's born,

429
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,360
Mom will give
another gift for her grandchild.

430
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,920
Then,

431
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,960
we should have more babies.
So we can open more branches.

432
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,320
Anyway, has anyone told you
about your brother's bar?

433
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,440
Not yet. It's just opened.
Did it fail already?

434
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,560
No, it's very popular.

435
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,200
My friends said it's full of handsome guys

436
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,720
because there are
only beautiful hostesses at the bar.

437
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,480
I can't believe
Korn went into that business.

438
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,200
But they rave about the singer.

439
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,640
They said she has great a voice
and is very charming.

440
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,760
It's annoying.

441
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,120
New bars are always exciting at first.

442
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,680
Then people get bored.

443
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,800
I can't stand seeing Chome
succeed more than us.

444
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,520
That's not possible.

445
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,280
Their whole month of singing

446
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,840
can't even beat two diamond necklaces.

447
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,440
We just have to smile

448
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,000
and don't need to lose sleep like they do.

449
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,600
That's true.

450
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,520
We are different. Korn's just Korn.

451
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
He can't go so far.

452
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Not like Rawee.

453
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
I have to beat him on my own.

454
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,880
Dad will see

455
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
that he made the wrong choice.

456
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,000
He judged me wrong.

457
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,960
Are you sure this is the place?

458
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,120
No doubt.

459
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
Fancy foreign name.

460
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
I can't read it.

461
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,240
They think can run away from us?

462
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,920
This will be our new gold mine.

463
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,320
Did they apply for it yet?

464
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,440
No. They want to speak to you first.

465
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,400
Some already left.

466
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,120
They seemed unhappy.

467
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,640
They're about to be jobless
and are still picky.

468
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,800
With these low salaries,

469
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,080
how will we survive?

470
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,080
I heard the other hotel is giving raises.

471
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,040
They raised overtime pay too.
And it's paid daily.

472
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,280
I shouldn't have quit.

473
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,640
It's like Chen tricked us.

474
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,800
Yes.

475
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,480
He used us.

476
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,280
It's been three months.

477
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,520
What's the problem?

478
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,240
The pay's too low.

479
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,120
My hotel just opened.
You should help out for now.

480
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,840
You should've told us from the start.

481
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,720
Why?

482
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,320
If I had told you the pay would be lower,

483
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
would you have left that hotel to help me?

484
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,480
Don't forget

485
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
that you're living comfortable lives now

486
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,520
because of me.

487
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm not forcing anyone.

488
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
If you think it's too little,

489
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,800
you can go back.

490
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,720
But don't forget, Rawee isn't stupid.

491
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,440
You think he doesn't know you were my men?

492
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,760
Why else would
he let you quit immediately and still pay?

493
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,160
He wants to get rid of all my people.

494
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,080
Do you think he'll take you back
even if you ask for it?

495
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,720
Think about it.

496
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,880
You have until the end of the month.

497
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,400
After that,

498
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,600
I'll get you out

499
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,800
and hire new people.

500
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,920
What should we do?

501
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
What should we do?

502
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,360
DESERTED PARADISE

503
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,560
Hey.

504
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,200
The decoration should be good enough now.

505
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,680
Hey…

506
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,960
You already did great inviting
the lead actors to the opening.

507
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
I think

508
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
the fans care more

509
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,080
about stars than the decorations.

510
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,280
I think it's already very good now.

511
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm glad you said that.

512
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,920
I'll ask guests to dress in a way
that matches the theme of the story,

513
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,200
something in ocean tones
like blue or sea green.

514
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,480
Good idea. We can use it for PR.

515
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,000
But after this, you need rest.

516
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
You've overworked yourself.

517
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,120
Are you worried
about your baby or your wife?

518
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,280
Both.

519
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,560
You're up?

520
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,600
Where were you?

521
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,320
Many places.

522
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,520
What did you buy?

523
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Just some stuff.

524
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,840
Let's eat out today.

525
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,280
If you're that stingy, I'll take it all.

526
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,600
What's got you in such a good mood?
You're sitting there smiling to yourself.

527
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,920
Here.

528
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,040
Application

529
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
for reinstatement?

530
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,680
The hotel staff
who resigned under Chen's order

531
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,600
are now requesting to come back.

532
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,400
Why did they change their minds?

533
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,080
It's exactly as I expected.

534
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,800
Back when Chen worked with us,

535
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,080
he burned through our money
giving high salaries to win loyalty,

536
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,800
so he could control them like puppets.

537
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,120
But now that they've left to work for him,

538
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,960
he can't afford to pay them.

539
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,360
Plus, we raised our overtime pay.

540
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,920
That made the income gap even wider.

541
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,600
But they're afraid to come back,

542
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,600
because they know
I'm aware they were on Chen's side.

543
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,200
But there are a lot of request forms here.

544
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,360
It doesn't look like they're too afraid.

545
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,520
I had the lawyer go persuade them.

546
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,400
The lawyer?

547
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,400
The one you turned
from Chen's man into yours?

548
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,640
I told him this afternoon, and by evening,
I had this whole stack back.

549
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,960
But you're really going
to take them back just like that?

550
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,320
Of course, with conditions.

551
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,600
Same salaries,

552
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,280
but I'll decide the positions myself
based on merit.

553
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,240
And I won't take everyone back either.

554
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,920
The restructuring plan
Rak and Korn set out,

555
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,200
reducing staff
and matching people to the right roles,

556
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,200
I've finally carried it through.

557
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,880
My husband is so capable.

558
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,800
That's all the reward I get?

559
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,400
But Chen won't back down so easily.

560
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,400
That's true.

561
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
And I don't think
I'll be the only one he comes after.

562
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,840
Thanks so much for coming.

563
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,360
I've seen you here
a few nights in a row now.

564
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,440
Before you leave, don't forget

565
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,240
to grab a discount card from the cashier.

566
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,320
Thanks a lot.

567
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,680
What's with the sour face
to your customer?

568
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,560
In hospitality, you smile no matter what.

569
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,080
Like it or not, keep it for yourself.

570
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,320
Personal issues stay buried.

571
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,920
Customers are always king.

572
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm happy for you, you know.

573
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,680
I never thought a hopeless kid like you

574
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,920
would end up owning a business.

575
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,200
All the tables are full, sir.

576
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,720
- You can't come in right now.
- Hey!

577
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,560
The place is big.

578
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,360
What do you mean full?

579
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,440
Look, there are plenty of empty seats.

580
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,320
One guy won't crowd the place!

581
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,040
- They've reserved but haven't arrived yet.
- I don't care.

582
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,760
I'll sit here. If they come, I'll move.

583
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,880
Sir.

584
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,520
Let me find a seat for you, sir.

585
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,000
Who the hell are you?

586
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,240
The owner.

587
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,880
A person like you is the owner?

588
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,680
Don't worry.

589
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,720
I'll get you a special seat.

590
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,840
This way, please.

591
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,960
What's the special seat? The toilet?

592
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,320
Hey!

593
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,080
You wanna seat me on a toilet?

594
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
‪Stop!

595
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,240
Go fight outside!

596
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,840
I said stop!

597
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,720
- Damn it.
- Korn, come here.

598
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,240
- Come here.
- Hey!

599
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,560
Don't go in there. You'll get hurt.

600
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,040
Let it go.

601
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,000
Hey!

602
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,160
- Korn.
- Anyone who wants to live,

603
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,280
get out!

604
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,600
Korn!

605
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,520
Korn!

606
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,640
I'm dragging your ass to jail!
You'll pay for my damages!

607
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,240
Come here.

608
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
- Come here.
- No!

609
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,080
The cops are coming!

610
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,120
Let's go.

611
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,160
Go.

612
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,040
Korn.

613
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,000
Korn.

614
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,640
Korn.

615
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,200
Rawee.

616
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,440
Ranee.

617
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,280
Yes, Auntie?

618
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,200
Have you heard about Ronnakorn yet?

619
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,400
This morning, Cha-aim went to the market

620
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,440
and overheard some vendors talking.

621
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,360
They said there was a fight

622
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,920
at the bar last night.

623
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,160
Ronnakorn got injured

624
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,560
and is now in the hospital.

625
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,040
Korn got hurt like this because of you.

626
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,320
Who would think
something like this would happen?

627
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,160
How could you not think?

628
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,960
A bar would of course
draw all kinds of thugs!

629
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,200
You claimed you had experience.

630
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,040
Yet you didn't even think about this.

631
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,160
There's no safety at all.

632
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,200
What if a customer got hurt?
What would you do?

633
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,920
I'll do better.

634
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,160
Do better?

635
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,440
So you're still planning to reopen?

636
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,080
I invested so much.

637
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
You really want me to shut it down
when I've just started?

638
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,200
Do you really have to be at death's door
before you learn?

639
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,480
That bar of yours got popular overnight.

640
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,360
Do you think people are happy for you?

641
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,120
They're jealous. They curse you

642
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
because you stole their customers.

643
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,480
That's just business, Mom.

644
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,960
If you do it better,
customers will come to you.

645
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,640
If you're afraid of competition,

646
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,800
then just put your money in the bank
and live off the interest.

647
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,080
I've said my piece.

648
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,200
If you still want to go on, suit yourself.

649
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,000
Just focus on getting better first.

650
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,240
Don't go playing the hero.

651
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,160
No need to rush reopening.
Let things settle first.

652
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,760
Who brought you to the hospital?

653
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,000
Once you're better,
buy them something as thanks.

654
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,760
Gratitude matters.

655
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,880
Don't overlook it.

656
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,040
It was Chen. He helped Korn.

657
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,080
That ungrateful bastard?

658
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Really?

659
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,400
You didn't tell me.

660
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,680
You didn't ask. And everything
was so chaotic, I completely forgot.

661
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,200
I don't trust him.

662
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,760
Me neither.

663
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,120
He might've staged the whole thing
to mess with me.

664
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,160
It must have been him.

665
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,760
You think he wants you
to be more successful than him?

666
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,920
If you're really

667
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,480
going down this road,

668
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,280
you'd better go all the way.

669
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,480
Gambling dens need thugs
to keep things under control.

670
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,200
Bars do too.

671
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,560
It's easier said than done.

672
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,960
Where am I supposed
to find people like that?

673
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,760
Still got the nerve to be here?

674
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,200
You should be ashamed.

675
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,240
Your brother's hurt
because of your selfishness.

676
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,160
So whatever goes wrong between us,

677
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,080
it's always my fault, Mom?

678
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,280
You want me to carry all the blame?

679
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,120
Don't you raise your voice at me.

680
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,760
I can't help thinking about this.

681
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,360
If the one who inherited was Rak,

682
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,920
you would've stood up for him,
tried to mediate peace between us.

683
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,600
But it was me, the one you never loved.

684
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,400
That's why you're upset.

685
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,480
No matter what I do,

686
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,520
it'd be worthless to you.

687
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,360
I never even wanted this, you know?

688
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,840
I knew it'd end like this.

689
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,320
But I had no choice.

690
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,440
Dad begged me to do it.

691
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,840
So let me ask you.

692
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,520
If you were me,

693
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,120
could you turn down Dad's final request?

694
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,720
Seeing our family break apart,

695
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,920
not even being able

696
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,400
to look each other in the eyes,

697
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,840
it kills me inside.

698
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,960
I love them all so much.

699
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,560
If that's all, I'll go.

700
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,320
No.

701
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,760
Do you want to know what else Dad told me?

702
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,560
A full diamond set.

703
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,160
The special price is just for today.

704
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,600
I'm interested.

705
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,480
I've been thinking
about what your mom said

706
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,000
about hiring someone to watch the bar.

707
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,080
But I don't know
where to find someone like that.

708
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,000
Leave it to me.

709
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,160
Chat.

710
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,720
If brains won't win this fight,
we'll have to use force.

711
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,840
- Why are you here?
- For the cinema opening, of course.

712
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,000
Get out of here!

713
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,200
I won't let you wreck this place
like you did my bar.

714
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,920
Ms. Ranee!

715
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,320
Ranee? Ranee?

716
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,240
