1
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,520
Are you trying to kill me?

2
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,880
<i>Your wish is finally coming true.</i>

3
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,080
The three brothers
are coming together again.

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,680
<i>You think you can be happy without me?</i>
<i>Dream on.</i>

5
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
- Chome!
- Korn, get out!

6
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
- Korn!
- Mei!

7
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
Today, I'm taking you and your son down.

8
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,760
Ranee!

9
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,000
Ranee!

10
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm very sorry.

11
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
We couldn't save both patients.

12
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Korn…

13
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,640
Madam…

14
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Madam…

15
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,600
Madam…

16
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,560
Korn…

17
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,480
I told you not to come.

18
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,560
What if you faint
and end up needing treatment too?

19
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,280
Oh, Madam. I'm worried.

20
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
I couldn't just stay home.

21
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,240
I had to come see for myself

22
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,200
that my sweetheart is truly safe.

23
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,960
Mr. Ronnakorn should've been lucky too…

24
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Poor Rawee. He loved his brother dearly.

25
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,480
Yes.

26
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Why…

27
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
Why do you feel sorry…

28
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
for Rawee?

29
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,360
- Ranee.
- Get up slowly, Grandma.

30
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,840
- Be careful.
- My sweetheart.

31
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Thank the heavens.

32
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,920
It's like you were reborn.

33
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
My dear.

34
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,400
My dear.

35
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
You finally woke up.

36
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,880
My dear, once you're discharged,

37
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,160
we'll have to make
a big merit offering, okay?

38
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,160
Korn… how is he?

39
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,440
Korn's safe,

40
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
right?

41
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,160
Korn's with his dad now, dear.

42
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You told me

43
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,640
they loved each other so much, right?

44
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,080
His dad came to take him.

45
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,840
Korn…

46
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
It's okay, dear.

47
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,040
You're safe now.

48
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Easy, Grandma.

49
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640
Sit down slowly.

50
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Thank you…

51
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Thank you for still being here.

52
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,680
I didn't get to bless your wedding yet.

53
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,000
Why were you in such a rush?

54
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,120
You missed Dad that much?

55
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,280
You broke your promise, Korn.

56
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,080
You said you'd make my wish come true…

57
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,280
Let me pay my respects to him too.

58
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,160
Bro, start the car!

59
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,360
- Young Master!
- Let's go!

60
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,040
Korn, wait for me!

61
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,120
Korn!

62
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,080
Let me see it too.

63
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
You can't. You're too young.

64
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,600
- Let me see it.
- No.

65
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,720
Or I'll tell Mom.

66
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,760
Fine.

67
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,840
Is it because I tried
to control all of your lives?

68
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Is that why our family ended up like this?

69
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,240
I meddled too much.

70
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,520
You all didn't want to listen to me.

71
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,240
You fought back against me.

72
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
It's my fault Korn died.

73
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,400
It's all my fault.

74
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,960
Don't blame yourself, Mom.

75
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
No matter what,

76
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,840
Korn's not coming back.

77
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm leaving.

78
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
Where will you go?

79
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,760
You're not staying with me?

80
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,280
I can't stay here, Mom.

81
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,440
Every corner is filled with memories.

82
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,840
I see us everywhere.

83
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,320
I can't start over here.

84
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,880
I'll stay at a hotel for a while.

85
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,520
And what about me?

86
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,160
Who else do I have now?

87
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,320
Why did he want to meet here
of all places?

88
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,880
Yeah. This is weird.

89
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
That was quick.

90
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
I priced it low.

91
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,120
Here's your cut.

92
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,720
What?

93
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
So you're planning to cheat me?

94
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,600
Rak?

95
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Thank you.

96
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,960
It's such a loss. Mr. Korn was so young.

97
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
I have one question.

98
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,280
Go ahead.

99
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,760
Where did these pieces come from?

100
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
Why?

101
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
They're from my shop.

102
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,120
One set was sold the day we opened.

103
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,360
So?

104
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,080
My store was scammed and shut down.

105
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,560
I think it was planned.

106
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,480
You weren't involved, were you?

107
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,600
I didn't get involved in anything.

108
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,320
I think I was tricked too.

109
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,400
Then for the sake of my brother's spirit,

110
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,440
would you help us find the truth?

111
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,840
You're cornered. There's no way out now.

112
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,720
You backstabbed me!

113
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
You forced me into this!

114
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,160
Police!

115
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,680
It's over. Just surrender.

116
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,080
Hey! Watch out!

117
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,280
What? Tub?

118
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,960
Please, Tub, stop this.

119
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,800
Turn yourself in.

120
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,120
- Tub!
- Rak!

121
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,720
Tub!

122
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,440
Clear.

123
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,160
Tub.

124
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
- Tub.
- Take them.

125
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Go.

126
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
I don't like owing anyone.

127
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,400
Don't ever do anything like that
for me again.

128
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Here. Eat.

129
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,440
Thank you.

130
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Tell me if you can't do it.

131
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,560
Why are you playing tough?

132
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,760
Here.

133
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,400
Eat so you get your strength back.

134
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,000
Thank you.

135
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,680
That's enough thanks. Eat.

136
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
Oh, my.

137
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
Is that a poisoned apple?

138
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,640
If I knew someone was here,
I wouldn't have rushed.

139
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,600
You still haven't found
your lucky number, have you?

140
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,040
You know me too well.

141
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Here.

142
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,920
Well.

143
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,840
It's good you're here.
Please take care of my niece.

144
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,800
I'll be back in the afternoon.

145
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
- Okay.
- Here.

146
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,720
- Eat all this.
- Thank you.

147
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,000
Here.

148
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,320
Thank you for being kind to my niece.

149
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,840
But I'm still not giving up
the land of Ms. Lamduan.

150
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,120
Of course. That's another thing.

151
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,840
Glad you know.

152
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
May the best one win.

153
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,400
Of course.

154
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,080
Dear, I'll be back.

155
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,520
Yes, Auntie.

156
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,000
You're impressive,
being able to handle an aunt like that.

157
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,880
When I get better,
do you want me to stay with you?

158
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,720
No. Go back to your husband.

159
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760
I want peace.

160
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,560
It's been annoying all my life.

161
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,440
Korn, learn from your brother Rak.
All you do

162
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,600
is play guitar all day.

163
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm a hidden dragon, Mom.

164
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll top the class. Just wait and see.

165
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Big talker.

166
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,840
Here, eat this, you hardworking boy.

167
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
- Thank you, Mom.
- Give it to Wee too.

168
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,280
Go to bed now!

169
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,440
We're going to bed now, Mom.

170
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,080
Wake up early to study.
Don't waste your time.

171
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,960
Yes, Mom.

172
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,080
Go check.

173
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,840
That looks really delicious, Auntie.

174
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,680
I made it myself, dear.

175
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,360
I stewed the chicken
until it was really tender.

176
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,480
I even guarantee
that Madam Mei won't choke on it.

177
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
Auntie!

178
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,200
Here, bring this
to visit your mother-in-law.

179
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,600
Sure.

180
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,160
All right.

181
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,760
How's she doing?
I heard she's been sick for a while.

182
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,720
The sickness isn't that serious.

183
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,840
But she's lost the will to fight.

184
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,640
She can't eat, can't sleep,
that's why she's not recovering.

185
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,480
She's stubborn.
She probably misses her son to death.

186
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,720
Honestly,
Rawee should go visit her sometimes.

187
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,080
Have you told him she's sick?

188
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,080
I have. He asks
how she's doing every now and then.

189
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,280
But I don't dare pressure him to go.

190
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,200
He always thinks he's not important.

191
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,800
But I think for her right now,

192
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
any child's support

193
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,880
matters just the same.

194
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,360
I told you, I'm not eating.
I'm not hungry.

195
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,680
Can't you understand plain words?

196
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,280
I said I'm not eating. I'm not hungry.

197
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm sorry, Mom.

198
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
Can I come back here?

199
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm worried about you.
I don't want you to be alone.

200
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,320
Alone? I've got maids all over the house.

201
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,440
You know it's not the same.

202
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,280
I'll go to work now.

203
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
I'll move back this evening.

204
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,680
I love all my children equally.

205
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,720
But I admit,

206
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,680
I was closer to Rak.

207
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,400
He was my first.

208
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,480
He was born
when your dad and I were still struggling

209
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,160
and barely had time to rest.

210
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,400
When I was carrying him…

211
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,880
I nearly miscarried so many times.

212
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,320
When he got sick as a child,

213
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,760
it hurt me deeply.

214
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,800
We suffered through everything together.

215
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,360
It was different from you and Korn.

216
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,600
You both had it easier.

217
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,560
Rak gave me the strength

218
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,400
to keep going.

219
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,000
That's why

220
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,520
I ended up being a biased mother.

221
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
Everyone saw me
loving my children unequally.

222
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,320
But I just wanted to make it up to Rak.

223
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,480
No matter what anyone said,

224
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,760
I never felt the need to explain,

225
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
because explaining

226
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,480
would only reopen the wound.

227
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
And I can't forget it.

228
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,280
Mom, you don't have to say it anymore.

229
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,120
You don't have to say it anymore.
I'm sorry. I understand everything now.

230
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,760
RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

231
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

232
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,160
Madam?

233
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Why is she here?

234
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,920
What else? She's probably here
to negotiate about the factory.

235
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,240
What business do you have, Madam?

236
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,600
The hotel is beautiful, clean, and nice.

237
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,120
All the mistakes started with me.

238
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
If that day,

239
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,640
I had shown you more kindness,

240
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,600
none of this would've happened.

241
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,640
Why bring it up now?

242
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,920
I came to apologize.

243
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,320
To you too, Hongyok.

244
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,920
I brought you into the family,

245
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,480
but I never made you feel like family.

246
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,040
Korn's death…

247
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,760
made me…

248
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,040
look back on everything I've done.

249
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,240
But I must make one thing clear.

250
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,240
The one I poisoned was Chanraem, not you.

251
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,720
And today,

252
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,400
I've paid for my sins.

253
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,120
I don't want to lose anyone else.

254
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,320
You've done well

255
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,200
to make it this far.

256
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,320
I truly admire you.

257
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,120
Your dad would be proud.

258
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,440
All this time,

259
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,200
I wasn't happy doing what I did.

260
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,280
But I waited for this day

261
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,160
to prove to you

262
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,960
that someone you belittled,

263
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,200
hated,

264
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,680
and tried to destroy,

265
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,920
could succeed

266
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,800
and earn your respect.

267
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,720
I see it now.

268
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,480
You are truly your dad's son.

269
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,560
You have his fighting spirit.

270
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
From now on,

271
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,640
whether you consider us family

272
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,360
is up to you.

273
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,080
But I beg you.

274
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,840
Please stop hurting your brothers.

275
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,200
Everything

276
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,280
was all my fault.

277
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,080
It's not for my sake

278
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,600
that I came here to apologize,

279
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,640
but I beg you.

280
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,560
Do it for your dad.

281
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,560
His spirit

282
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,480
has suffered long enough

283
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,240
watching his children
tear each other apart.

284
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,040
Please let him

285
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,760
finally find peace.

286
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,640
CHAROENRUNG CINEMA

287
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,840
Hello, hello? Hi, everyone!

288
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,160
Today, we celebrate
the birthday of Master Jiw,

289
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,160
the founder of Charoenrung Cinema.

290
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,720
This cinema is
a true landmark of our province,

291
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,760
the very first one ever built!

292
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,880
And to commemorate him,

293
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,880
we're hosting
a free movie screening today.

294
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,160
And free food too!

295
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,200
Eat first or watch first, up to you.

296
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,960
If you want drinks, go left.
Snacks, go right.

297
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,840
And if you're really hungry,
well, you should've eaten at home.

298
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,840
And our main sponsor is Madam Mei!

299
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Are you thirsty? Drink up.

300
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,440
Oh, perfect timing.
I'm thirsty. Thank you.

301
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,200
Drink more so your mouth stays full.

302
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,320
- You talk way too much. It's annoying.
- Oh, goodness.

303
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,560
Free food! Free movies!

304
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,760
Give it up for Madam Mei!

305
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,640
Madam Mei, everyone!

306
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,160
They're a frenemy duo now.

307
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,440
Without Auntie, Mom would be so lonely.

308
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,080
Eat all you want today, it's all free!

309
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,360
- What would you like.
- Ice cream's here!

310
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,840
Ice cream's here!

311
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,440
I brought coconut ice cream to help out.

312
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,560
Lovely! Coconut ice cream.

313
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,880
Everyone, be patient.
Hey, go help scoop ice cream.

314
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,360
Anyone want some ice cream? Line up here.

315
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,520
Go ahead.

316
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,520
- Go.
- Come on.

317
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,440
Thank you.

318
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,880
Can I have a scoop too?

319
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,440
Rak, you're here.

320
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,840
- How are you?
- I'm good.

321
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,960
If you want me back to work here,

322
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,720
you've gotta be by my side.
Otherwise, I'm out.

323
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,680
Oh, you said it like that…
How could I possibly say no?

324
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,240
Don't say no, then.

325
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
I just don't want to mess up again.

326
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,520
With you here, I feel safer.

327
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,400
We're the only brothers left.

328
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,880
So where does that leave me?

329
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,200
What, I'm not family now?

330
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,640
No, that's not what I meant.

331
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
I'm just kidding.

332
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,040
I actually came to tell you.

333
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,680
My business partner changed his mind.

334
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
He's not building the factory
next to your hotel anymore.

335
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,120
Thank you.

336
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,400
About before…

337
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,360
- I--
- I know.

338
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,360
You were following Dad's orders
to test me, weren't you?

339
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,720
So, did I pass?

340
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,440
You're great.
Dad trusted you for a reason.

341
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,880
Of course you passed.

342
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,760
But don't test me.

343
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,200
Or I'm off to travel the world
and won't come back.

344
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,160
Well, now that we're all together,

345
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,400
we can discuss how both hotels
can collaborate with each other.

346
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,440
Sounds good.

347
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,240
Let's eat and talk.
Let's go to the restaurant.

348
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,760
Let's go.

349
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,520
You did a good job.

350
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,960
Thank you, Mom.

351
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,560
From now on,

352
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,840
you can handle all the accounts.

353
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
Yes, Mom.

354
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,960
As for the cinema,

355
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,520
whether you want to keep managing it
or hire someone is up to you.

356
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,240
Don't overwork yourself.

357
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,600
If you're too stressed with work,

358
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,720
I'll never get a grandchild.

359
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,560
Yes, Mom.

360
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,680
Once Rak settles into work,

361
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,680
I'll ask Rawee to help me.

362
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,400
Then I can finally retire.

363
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,320
<i>My prejudice blinded me for so long.</i>

364
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,920
<i>I only saw the light</i>

365
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,400
<i>after a terrible loss.</i>

366
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,560
Dad, you can rest easy now.

367
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,480
Our family is whole again.

368
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,200
I promise Ranee and I
will take care of Mom

369
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,640
and everyone for you. Don't worry.

370
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,360
And Korn, I've got good news.

371
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,640
Ranee's pregnant.

372
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,880
You uncles better help raise the baby too.

373
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,360
For the next one, if anyone wants a kid,
I'll hand them out.

374
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,320
I'm not a baby factory.

375
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,440
Count me out.

376
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,040
But I'm interested. Hongyok and I

377
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,800
have been thinking of adopting.

378
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,680
No worries, Bro.
Let's all help raise them. I'm aiming for…

379
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,480
six.

380
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,680
Are you nuts? I'm not doing that.

381
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,800
You're just talk.
I bet you'll be worn out after one.

382
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,400
Exactly. He's asleep by 8 p.m.

383
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,040
Hey, you're embarrassing
your husband in public.

384
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,480
Am I wrong?

385
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,040
Well…

386
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,760
He sleeps at eight.

387
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,240
- What about you?
- 7:30.

388
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,560
Rawee looks better now.

389
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,640
And for me, it's 6 p.m.

390
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,880
<i>So this is the kind of family</i>

391
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,520
<i>you always dreamed of.</i>

392
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:21,400
THE END

393
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,680
