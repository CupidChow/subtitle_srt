1
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,560
{\an8}Where has it gone to?

2
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,720
{\an8}My wife's got real skills.

3
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,520
{\an8}I suspect Master Rak is trying
to squeeze more money from Madam again.

4
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,880
{\an8}<i>How much do you need?</i>

5
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,120
{\an8}I'm not spending your money.
I just want to help safeguard it

6
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,920
{\an8}before it all gets blown.

7
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
{\an8}Hey, Korn, watch your mouth.

8
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,320
{\an8}Die now!

9
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
‪Here.

10
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,680
What would you like for your birthday?

11
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
You can't buy it anywhere.

12
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
Just tell me first.

13
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,280
Who knows? Maybe I can find it for you.

14
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,960
I want us siblings
to love each other again like we used to.

15
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Where can I get that for you?

16
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,640
The monk is here.

17
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
Please.

18
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,120
Get that for me, please.

19
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,480
<i>Don't make any rash decisions yet.</i>

20
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,200
<i>Wait until you're no longer</i>
<i>heartbroken about the baby.</i>

21
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,880
It's pointless, Mom.

22
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,720
I've given him so many chances.

23
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,480
Once I'm discharged,
I'm going back to talk to Dad and Mom.

24
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Your parents

25
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,960
wouldn't want their daughter
to become a divorced woman.

26
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,120
So I should stay with a horrible husband

27
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,480
just to avoid being judged
for being divorced?

28
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm still young and pretty.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
I can find someone better.

30
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
Ngor, go take a shower and get changed.

31
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Go with me to Duangporn's house.

32
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm still not fully recovered.

33
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,560
I don't want to embarrass myself
if I trip and fall.

34
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,760
Are you really going?

35
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,320
I need to speak with her parents first.

36
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,120
No matter what,
I won't let the two of them get divorced.

37
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,360
An uninvited guest wanted to meet you.

38
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,760
What's the matter?

39
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
Are you free this evening?

40
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm not sure.

41
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,920
Why?

42
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,560
I want to invite you
to a party at the hotel.

43
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,440
What kind of party?

44
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
It's Rawee's birthday.

45
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,880
You've got some nerve,

46
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,040
pretending like you don't know
they're on bad terms.

47
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,640
Siblings can't be cut off from each other.

48
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,200
I guess that's how your husband justifies

49
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,800
taking advantage of his own brothers.

50
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,040
If all wives were as narrow-minded as you,

51
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,320
the siblings would never reconcile.

52
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,000
Watch your mouth.

53
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,880
How am I narrow-minded?

54
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Should I just let him
let his brothers walk all over him

55
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,320
to be open-minded?

56
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,560
Enough.

57
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,760
If I'm free, I'll go.

58
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Rawee said the only gift
he wants this year

59
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,640
is for all of you to be united again.

60
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,440
I don't think it's that hard.

61
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,280
Deep down, the three of you
have always loved each other.

62
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
See you at the banquet hall at 7.

63
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
I'll be waiting.

64
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
If it were me, I wouldn't go.

65
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,920
R&D Jewelry.

66
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,640
It's me, Ranee.

67
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,160
What's the matter?

68
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,240
Do you have time this evening
to come to the hotel?

69
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,480
For what?

70
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,160
It's Rawee's birthday.

71
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,960
- I wanted to surprise him--
- <i>You don't know, do you?</i>

72
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
Know what?

73
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,080
Duangporn had a miscarriage.

74
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,920
You think I'd be in the mood
to celebrate your husband's birthday?

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

76
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
My condolences.

77
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,000
Even if she hadn't miscarried,

78
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
you think I could face Rawee?

79
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,240
My shop is going under.
My family is falling apart.

80
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,360
I've failed at everything.
I can't compare to my little brother.

81
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,680
You want to parade me
in front of your husband

82
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,080
so he can be proud on his birthday, right?

83
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,640
No, that's not it.

84
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
That's not what I think.

85
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
I'm not going.

86
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
And tell Rawee…

87
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
he's finally beaten his older brother.

88
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
You're misunderstanding.

89
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,960
Rawee has never seen
any of this as a competition.

90
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,880
Rak?

91
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
Rak?

92
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,040
I feel relieved.

93
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,720
Her parents listened and understood me.

94
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,280
No parents

95
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,080
would want to see their daughter
become a young divorcée.

96
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,080
Who's getting divorced?

97
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,280
Oh, Young Master!

98
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,320
You scared me.

99
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
It's good you're here.

100
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
I was hoping to see you.

101
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,760
You promised to give up the bar

102
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,720
and break up with that singer.

103
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,280
Things take time, Mom.

104
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,600
We have to start with what matters most.

105
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,400
And I need your help with that.

106
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,480
What is it?

107
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,320
Mr. Bancha recommended some women to me.

108
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,920
I found one I like.

109
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
Her name is Tipsuda.

110
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,280
She's the district chief's daughter.

111
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,320
I've met her before.

112
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,680
Wasn't she studying abroad?
She's back now?

113
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,480
Yes.

114
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,160
I want you to help me

115
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,080
formally meet her parents,

116
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,080
so our families
can get to know each other.

117
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,120
Sure.

118
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,240
I know her mother. I'll set up a meal.

119
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Thanks, Mom.

120
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,720
I'm not worried about the bar.

121
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,200
You can shut it down anytime

122
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,560
because it's yours.

123
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,000
But that singer of yours…

124
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,200
She's not going to let you go easily.

125
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
Be careful.

126
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,320
If Tipsuda's parents find out,

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,600
they'll never accept you.

128
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,080
When are you ending it?

129
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,080
Don't worry about it.

130
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,520
You can start planning the wedding now.

131
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,360
Make it the biggest one in the province.

132
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,760
I need the publicity

133
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,080
before next year's election.

134
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,720
CHAROENRUNG HOTEL

135
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,840
<i>Did you get the letter?</i>

136
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,920
Is this your doing?

137
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,760
Blame Dad's amateur moves, not me.

138
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,840
Dad knew

139
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
that plot next to the hotel

140
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
was zoned for factory use.

141
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,360
But he used his friendship
with Master Wiboon to keep it undeveloped.

142
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,360
<i>He agreed and built elsewhere.</i>

143
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
But now his son,

144
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,880
my hotel partner, wants to build.

145
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,440
<i>What now?</i>

146
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
We're both Dad's sons.

147
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,920
I'll try to get him to switch

148
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,840
to a factory that doesn't stink too much.

149
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,040
This hotel was Dad's legacy.

150
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,120
He built it with his own sweat and tears.
You really want to see it ruined?

151
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Dad's dead. He doesn't care anymore.

152
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,240
But it's your side of the family
that's reaping the rewards.

153
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,520
That's what I can't stand.

154
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,960
Do we really have to hate
and never forgive each other until we die?

155
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,280
Is that how it's going to be?

156
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,480
Yes.

157
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,480
I wonder if your guests
will enjoy your service at the hotel

158
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
next to a foul-smelling factory.

159
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Happy birthday.

160
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,200
<i>Don't be surprised</i>

161
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,880
<i>I remembered your birthday.</i>

162
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,520
I remember all of your birthdays,

163
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,800
especially your mother's.

164
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,960
<i>You know why?</i>

165
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,360
I remember so I can curse her.

166
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,640
I hope you all rot in Hell

167
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,400
<i>for what you did to me</i>

168
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,120
and my family.

169
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,400
I hope you enjoy my little gift,

170
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,800
Rawee.

171
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,280
Happy birthday, Rawee?

172
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,840
Why are you here again?

173
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,200
I brought food.

174
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,599
It's too much.
Who's going to eat all this?

175
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,280
The hotel is holding a party.

176
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,000
- What party?
- For the manager's birthday.

177
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,599
If you're free tonight,

178
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,760
I'll pick you up for the party.

179
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not going.

180
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
If I go, it's like I'm begging him.

181
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Don't think of it that way.

182
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,720
If you two could reconcile…

183
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,480
So I should apologize to him?

184
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,440
Admit I was wrong
to oppose the inheritance?

185
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,240
To accept that he got everything
while the others got nothing?

186
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,480
I can't.

187
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,400
I never meant it like that.

188
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
I just wanted Rawee to be happy

189
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
to see his family together.

190
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,440
In this house, we don't treat birthdays
as big deals like yours does.

191
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,000
It's just another day.

192
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,240
No one cares.

193
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
- You're cooking yourself today, Madam?
- Yes.

194
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,000
It's Rak's birthday.
I want to make something special for him.

195
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Be gentle. That hurts!

196
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,960
Have some tea, Mom.

197
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Hey, stop.

198
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,440
What do you want?

199
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,440
It's my birthday today.
Can I have some money to buy a new guitar?

200
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
Go get my wallet.

201
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
Thank you, Mom.

202
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,600
Mom.

203
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,040
Finish your meal first,
then you can eat dessert.

204
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,400
I've got to go check on the land.
I'll be back late.

205
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,040
Today is Rawee's birthday…

206
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,560
Believe me, don't waste your time.

207
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,160
And don't give Rawee any more hope.

208
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,080
He's a sensitive boy.

209
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,280
No one's going to his birthday.

210
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,000
I know my sons well.

211
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
Thanks for letting me know.

212
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,840
Yes.

213
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,560
Are you meeting Mr. Bancha?

214
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,520
Yes.

215
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm not going to the bar tonight.

216
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,200
Okay.

217
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So you gave in and went
to your brother's birthday after all.

218
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,440
What made you throw
such a big birthday party for me?

219
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,440
It's the hotel manager's birthday.

220
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,400
A small celebration wouldn't do.

221
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,920
So many people want to wish you well.

222
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,920
Except my own family.

223
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,600
Am I not your family?

224
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,960
The guests should be arriving. Let's go.

225
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,080
Let me help.

226
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,560
Many people called me.

227
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,520
So I had her gather everyone

228
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,040
to talk all at once.

229
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,120
So it really is fake?

230
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,320
It's mixed. Some real, some fake.

231
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,800
Some pieces were even mixed,
part real, part fake.

232
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
It was done to make it more convincing.

233
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,880
It's an organized scam.

234
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
Lately, they've been giving 35% discount.

235
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Don't fall for it.

236
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Caught red-handed.

237
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,320
It was you stabbing me in the back!

238
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,800
Hey!

239
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,480
You planned this revenge, didn't you?

240
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,040
We have nothing to avenge.

241
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,520
Stop it right now,
or I'll call the police.

242
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,960
Call the police, Ms. Chan.
Let's have him arrested.

243
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,160
Arrest me? For what?

244
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,640
If I really intended to scam anyone,

245
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,520
would I have agreed
to buy back all the goods?

246
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,560
I'd have shut down the shop
and disappeared by now.

247
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,800
And you accuse me and my wife of revenge?

248
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,640
What exactly did you do to us

249
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,280
that would make us seek revenge?

250
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,200
Tell everyone right here.

251
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
What did we hold against you?

252
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,520
Say it out loud.
Stop making baseless accusations.

253
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
Are you too ashamed to admit it?

254
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,800
Or should we discuss it
in front of the police?

255
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
Just wait until it's my turn.

256
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
He's a total thug.

257
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,640
Let's not support that shop again.

258
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,360
Hope it goes bankrupt.

259
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,160
Why did you let him hit you like that?

260
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,680
I had to play the victim,

261
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,160
so the ladies would sympathize with us
and trust us more.

262
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,200
I don't know who tipped him off.

263
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,280
It must be the one
who said they'd come but didn't.

264
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,440
Now that Rak knows, is that okay?

265
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,360
It's too late for him now.

266
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,800
What's the special occasion?

267
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,000
The occasion is just because I wanted to.

268
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,960
You can open it
and see if you like it or not.

269
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,200
Thank you.

270
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,840
I knew it.

271
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RAWEE

272
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,040
Thank you.

273
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
Why are you crying?

274
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm mad at myself.

275
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,400
I couldn't even do
something this simple for you.

276
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
What did you try to do?

277
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,440
To make your wish come true.

278
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,120
I just wanted at least

279
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,000
one family member
to show up for your birthday.

280
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,880
Did you ask everyone to come?

281
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,920
You didn't have to do it.

282
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,280
They won't come.

283
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,080
I'm not that important.

284
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
Come in.

285
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,320
Manager,

286
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,320
a gift box just arrived for you.
It's huge.

287
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
From whom?

288
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,400
I'm not sure,

289
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,880
but it has a strange smell coming from it.

290
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,840
Where is it now?

291
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,160
In the banquet hall.
All the guests are talking about it.

292
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,600
Get security to clear the room.
I'll check it myself.

293
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,720
Yes, sir.

294
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You stay here.

295
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,560
It smells so bad it could be a corpse.

296
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,440
<i>The daily ingredients for the factory</i>

297
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,080
<i>will smell way worse than this.</i>

298
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,920
<i>Do you think your guests can handle that?</i>

299
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,440
- Throw it out.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,680
I told you. I can tell.

301
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,720
He's clearly into someone else.

302
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,400
That quiet boy turned out to be ruthless.

303
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,400
What do we do now?

304
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,040
I don't want to raise suspicion yet.

305
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Since we can't fix the root cause,

306
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,920
we'll have to deal
with the consequences instead.

307
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,080
All right. I'll handle it.

308
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,520
You want me to do it tonight?

309
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
What are you waiting for?

310
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,560
Just make sure
she's too scared to go near Korn again.

311
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
CHAROENRUNG CINEMA

312
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,480
NOW SHOWING

313
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,600
Do you want me to wait with you?

314
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,200
It's all right.
I haven't told my parents about you yet.

315
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,680
They might be shocked.

316
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
You should tell them soon.

317
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,640
I'll feel neglected.

318
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm waiting for the right moment.

319
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,960
I already told Mom.

320
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,320
She's ready to take me
to introduce myself to your dad anytime.

321
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,280
You just say when.

322
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,960
I want to make things right.

323
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
Thank you for respecting me.

324
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,960
But you'd better go now.
The movie's about to end.

325
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,560
Okay. Let's meet again soon.

326
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,080
Sure.

327
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

328
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,840
Come here!

329
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,120
Sit down!

330
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,280
Quiet! I said quiet!

331
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Hey.

332
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,120
I'm warning you. Stay away from Ronnakorn.

333
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,680
- Understand?
- Why?

334
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,080
You really don't get it?

335
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Go after him!

336
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,760
Are you all right, Ms. Tip?

337
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,000
Some thug tried to scare
Ms. Tip off Mr. Korn, sir.

338
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,320
That must be his woman's doing.

339
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,120
Where are they now?

340
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,800
Kan is chasing them.

341
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,720
Send more people. We have to stop them,

342
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,120
or it's all over.

343
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,240
Yes, sir.

344
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,920
- Come here.
- Hey.

345
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,920
We're in trouble.
We can't stay here. Let's go.

346
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,560
What are you talking about?

347
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,440
That new girl of Korn's

348
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,160
must be some mobster's daughter.

349
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,280
She's got people protecting her.

350
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,600
So she's serious about him.

351
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,080
Could it be tied to the election?

352
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,360
That's possible.

353
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,880
If we stay here,
we're not safe. We need to run.

354
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,000
I need to grab all his gold first.

355
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,520
Then do it.
We'd better leave as soon as possible.

356
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,760
Who needs anyone?
I can be on my own just fine.

357
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,719
I don't need any of you.

358
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,040
Happy birthday, Brother.

359
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,160
Hello?

360
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Happy birthday, Bro.

361
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,680
I remember

362
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,160
all your birthdays.

363
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,120
But when it's mine,

364
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,600
no one remembers.

365
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,800
- Happy birthday!
- Ghost!

366
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
What ghost? It's us!

367
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,520
You thought we forgot
your birthday, didn't you?

368
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Crybaby! You're crying!

369
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,080
I'm not crying.

370
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm just sleepy, that's all.

371
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,880
Sleepy?

372
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
- Blow out the candle.
- I'll hold it for you.

373
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO WEE

374
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,560
- Hey?
- Happy birthday!

375
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,320
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

376
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,800
Any update on what I asked you
to keep an eye on?

377
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,240
If I tell you,
you won't fire me, right?

378
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,280
Why would I fire you?

379
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,040
Just tell me what you saw.

380
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,840
Well, I don't think Mr. Chat and Ms. Chome

381
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,680
look like siblings.

382
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,920
They seem more like lovers.

383
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,800
I checked.
The ID cards are definitely fake.

384
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,160
If you want me to dig deeper,
like their names

385
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,200
or where they're from,
it'll take some time.

386
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,000
Those two

387
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,400
might not be siblings, like I suspected.

388
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,480
You might've been tricked.

389
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,760
They could be con artists.

390
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,960
That's probably why your gold bars
kept disappearing without a trace.

391
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,240
Well, if you're not emotionally tied
to this woman anymore, I'm relieved.

392
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,040
That means I can get her out
of your life more easily.

393
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,000
You're awake?

394
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,840
I'll go make breakfast.

395
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,360
No need.

396
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,640
You came back late from singing.
Get some more rest.

397
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,880
Thank you.

398
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,560
I've got an event with Bancha today.
I'll probably be back late.

399
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,600
Let's meet at the bar instead.

400
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,720
Sure.

401
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Go take care of your business.

402
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,440
Leave the bar to me.

403
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,880
Don't worry.

404
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,520
Thank you.

405
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,160
You can go back to sleep.

406
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
Okay.

407
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,360
Miss!

408
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,240
Miss!

409
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,720
Be careful.

410
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,360
There's big news!

411
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,040
You're gonna trip and fall.

412
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,040
People at the market
are gossiping like crazy that

413
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,120
Ms. Duangporn
is going to file for divorce from Mr. Rak!

414
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,760
What's going on, Duangporn?

415
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,000
Why is everyone in the market saying that?

416
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,040
Because your son refuses
to divorce me peacefully.

417
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,200
I've already spoken to your parents.

418
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,720
They don't want you two to split.

419
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,200
That's because they don't know
how horrible your son is.

420
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,240
Should I list all his sins?

421
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,400
Running off to brothels,
catching a disease,

422
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,600
missing exams and repeating a year.

423
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,200
Forcing himself on the maid,
getting her pregnant.

424
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,120
Getting expelled, and you had
to ship him abroad to save face.

425
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,400
Or should I bring up

426
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,440
how you poisoned the maid,
causing her to miscarry,

427
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,880
and how she came back for revenge
and ruined the jewelry shop?

428
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,320
Stop! I don't want to hear it!

429
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,320
I'm done tolerating!

430
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,280
I've overlooked everything for so long.

431
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,480
But bringing
some random woman into our bed?

432
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,960
I can't take it anymore.

433
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,800
If we settle amicably,

434
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,280
we can negotiate compensation.

435
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,160
But if I have to sue,

436
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,640
I'll ruin your reputation completely.

437
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,440
Come on, help me pack.

438
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:10,840
{\an8}R&D JEWELRY
50% OFF STOREWIDE

439
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,440
It's time.

440
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,400
You brought the money?

441
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,960
It's in my bag.

442
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,400
What about yours?

443
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,760
Mine's in the safe.

444
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,560
Then let's go.

445
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,040
Don't make it too violent.
I just want payback, that's all.

446
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,240
- If you're done, please leave.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,720
Yeah.

448
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,280
Fight fire with fire. He hurt me badly,
and it was on my birthday.

449
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,120
MANAGER'S OFFICE

450
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,200
So what kind of bomb should we use?

451
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,200
Yeah, make it loud,

452
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,080
but don't hurt anyone.

453
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,720
If they trip and fall running away,
that's another story.

454
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,520
All right, let's do it at noon today.

455
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,480
Don't panic!

456
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,160
Police are now searching
for the explosive.

457
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,360
You can leave your luggage.

458
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,800
Our staff will take care of it.

459
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,720
Please come out now.

460
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,600
It's just a bag! Nothing dangerous!

461
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,640
- This way, please.
- Hold it.

462
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,400
- Be careful.
- Please come outside.

463
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,120
Is everyone here?

464
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,320
This way, please.

465
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,880
‪RUNGCHAROEN HOTEL

466
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,920
Damn it!

467
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,960
Rawee's truly vile.

468
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,560
I didn't think he'd dare go this far.

469
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,880
Luckily, no one got hurt.

470
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,560
Someone should've gotten hurt.

471
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,640
Then we could've pressed charges.

472
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,040
Do you have proof it was him?

473
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,520
His secretary.

474
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,040
Time to unmask her and expose her boss.

475
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,760
A resignation form?

476
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,240
Sign it.

477
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,040
Are you firing me? What did I do?

478
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,440
There was a bomb scare
at Chen's hotel today.

479
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,720
I heard it was chaotic.

480
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,000
Good thing no one got hurt.

481
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,360
What does that have to do with me?

482
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,360
You overheard my call
and told Chen, didn't you?

483
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,120
You're the only one who knew besides me.

485
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,760
Because I was talking alone.
I wasn't talking to anyone.

486
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,520
So what kind of bomb should we use?

487
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Yeah, make it loud,

488
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,320
but don't hurt anyone.

489
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,480
If they trip and fall running away,
that's another story.

490
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,000
In the end, I even stood right here,

491
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,440
so you could hear me clearly.

492
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,200
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

493
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,040
I never trusted you anyway.

494
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,760
I only kept you around
in case you were useful.

495
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,120
If you don't want this
to go to the police,

496
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,600
then don't show your face again.

497
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,000
We've searched everywhere.

498
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,440
There's nothing suspicious.

499
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,160
It was likely a prank call.

500
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,440
Do you suspect anyone?

501
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,640
We certainly do.

502
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,080
Excuse me for a moment.

503
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,400
Hello?

504
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,320
So who do you suspect?

505
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,960
Who else could it be? It's…

506
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,320
No one.

507
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,080
It was probably some mischievous kids.

508
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,920
Thank you for your help, Officers.

509
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,160
No problem. I'm just doing my job.

510
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,040
It's lunchtime.

511
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,960
Please let us treat you

512
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,240
to a meal.

513
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,840
No need.

514
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,600
Please accept our gratitude.

515
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,840
Rawee realized the secretary was ours,

516
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,400
so he turned the tables.

517
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,960
You can't just tease him

518
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,680
just because he's your brother.

519
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,000
Look what he did to us.
If any guests had gotten injured,

520
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,600
what would you have done?

521
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,800
Mr. Chen.

522
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,320
Sales just told me
a lot of guests are checking out early.

523
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,160
What should we do about refunds?

524
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,320
Everything's 50% off?

525
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,880
Yes, sir.

526
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,240
What if I buy the whole shop?

527
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,320
Can I get a better deal?

528
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,280
Oh, sir.

529
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,080
Please don't bargain.
I'm already losing a lot.

530
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,960
Fine. Calculate the full price

531
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,880
and let me know how much it is.

532
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,760
Sure! I have a detailed list.

533
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,200
Please take a seat while I get it.

534
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,560
Just sell it off quick, so we can split
the money and go our separate ways.

535
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,840
Okay, we'll meet up later.

536
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,800
Are you sure we can trust him?

537
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,480
We poured nearly all our cash into this.

538
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,960
Let him try to cheat us.

539
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,560
After this, let's start everything over.

540
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,920
You're not angry anymore?

541
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,720
He's lost everything.

542
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,040
His wife left, his business failed,

543
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,400
his family's ruined.

544
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,520
His life is a failure.

545
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,320
That should make up for what he did to me.

546
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,200
Up to now,

547
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,080
I'm satisfied.

548
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,200
I've enjoyed getting revenge.

549
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,840
But deep down, I'm scared of karma.

550
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,920
Still, if I hadn't finished this,
I'd never die peacefully.

551
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,000
Now, I don't enjoy it anymore.

552
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,680
I'm afraid we'll screw up

553
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,080
and end up right back where we started.

554
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
I understand.

555
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
If you're done,

556
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,160
I'm done.

557
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,080
Don't overthink it.

558
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,880
Once we get our share,

559
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,880
we'll start over and build a new life.

560
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,280
Okay.

561
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,720
I'd be stupid
to split this evenly with you.

562
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,560
You can have three bars. That's enough.

563
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,080
{\an8}Are you trying to kill me?!

564
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,880
{\an8}Don't worry
that you won't find a new wife.

565
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,520
{\an8}I'll find one for you.

566
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,800
{\an8}No need, Mom.

567
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,800
{\an8}<i>Maybe I'm just meant to be alone.</i>

568
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,560
{\an8}Your wish is finally coming true.

569
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,320
{\an8}The three brothers
are coming together again.

570
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,960
{\an8}<i>You think you can be happy without me?</i>

571
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,360
{\an8}<i>Dream on.</i>

572
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,840
{\an8}Chome!

573
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,320
{\an8}Run!

574
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,880
