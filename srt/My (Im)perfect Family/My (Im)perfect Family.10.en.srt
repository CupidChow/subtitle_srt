1
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
There was an explosion
at Charoenrung Hotel!

2
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Rawee.

3
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,720
The one who stands to lose power
if you take over the hotel,

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,000
that's your prime suspect.

5
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
<i>Then write your resignation letter today.</i>

6
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,680
Don't think about
dragging this out any longer.

7
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
<i>Do you remember that woman?</i>

8
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
That woman hurt you, didn't she?

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't go rushing to grab just anyone.
I've already got someone in mind for you.

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you so much for making time for us.

11
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,160
One ceremony done, one more to go.

12
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Hang in there, Little Brother.

13
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
Rak!

14
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
Go see Grandpa and Grandma out.

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,200
Yes, Mom.

16
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,440
Grandpa, Grandma, this way, please.

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Please.

18
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,400
We should go too,
so the bride and groom can rest.

19
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,520
Five to ten minutes is enough.

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,360
You still have
the marriage registration ceremony.

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
I have to go home and prepare more things.

22
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,600
Oh, just rest as long as you want.

23
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,640
The registration can take place anytime.
The auspicious time is fairly flexible.

24
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,960
Then, I'll catch up in a bit, Mom.

25
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,880
Thank you.

26
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,080
Let's go.

27
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,160
Ranee. Rawee.

28
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,120
I truly wish you both the best.

29
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,640
Rawee, I'm entrusting Ranee to you.

30
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,160
You've said that
a hundred times today, Auntie.

31
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,800
Well, I worry about you.

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,400
Then let me give you
the hundredth promise.

33
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
I'll take care of Ranee
like you always have,

34
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,520
only I'll love her a hundred times more.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,040
Let's see.

36
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
I like this nephew-in-law already.

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,760
-Then I won't bother you two. Rest well.
-All right.

38
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
We finally made it to this day.

40
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,440
Should we take a nap?

41
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,200
Otherwise, we might not survive the night.

42
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,320
Stop it.

43
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,480
Is the altar prepared?

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,760
I've set them up a thousand times.
Of course, it's ready.

45
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,880
The tea ceremony is all set.

46
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,800
Made a few extra, just to be safe.

47
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
There won't be guests from Dad's side.

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,480
Only from Madam's.

49
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,120
What are you two doing here?

50
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,960
We're just helping
with the preparations, Madam.

51
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,520
It's my little brother's big day.

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
How could we just sit by and do nothing?

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,000
I hope my house won't be burned down.

54
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,920
That's an inauspicious thing to say.

55
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,080
Good that you two are here.

56
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
Who manages the rice mill's accounts now?

57
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,600
I do.

58
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,320
Next month after Rawee starts working,

59
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,960
-I'll take over again like before.
-No need.

60
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,520
Starting today,

61
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,040
all financial records
of the hotel, the rice mill,

62
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,080
and all our businesses

63
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,760
will be managed
by the first daughter-in-law.

64
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,680
Thank you, Mom. I'll do my very best

65
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,600
and live up to your trust.

66
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Dad. Dad!

67
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,760
You knew Mom was going
to do this, didn't you?

68
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,840
Those two

69
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
are like oil and water.

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,520
They'll never mix.

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,600
I've accepted that.

72
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,960
Mom's trying to take everything
back from Chen, isn't she?

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,800
I don't want to see my children

74
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,720
turn on each other.

75
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Right now,

76
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,640
you're the only one

77
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,720
who can mend this family.

78
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm counting on you, Rawee.

79
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,760
I'll try my best, Dad.

80
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
All right.

81
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,400
Did Korn tell you where he went?

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,960
He disappeared
before the ceremony was even over.

83
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,800
No, Dad.

84
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,640
But I'm sure he'll be back
by evening for the ceremony.

85
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,880
<i>Even if the sun abandons the horizon</i>

86
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,679
<i>And the night is left</i>
<i>Without stars beside the moon</i>

87
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,200
<i>Please know that</i>
<i>You still have someone by your side</i>

88
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,200
<i>Every day, never leaving</i>

89
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,760
<i>The sweet scent carried</i>
<i>By the breeze may fade away…</i>

90
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,160
Wasn't your brother getting married today?

91
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,760
Weren't you supposed to be there?

92
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
Whether I'm there or not,

93
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,720
they'll still make it
to the wedding bed just fine.

94
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,840
That's true.

95
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,240
I came here today for an answer.

96
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,480
Open it.

97
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,840
-It's beautiful.
-Is it a yes

98
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,280
or a no?

99
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,560
Four baskets of oranges, right?

100
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,760
-Yes.
-All right.

101
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,960
-I'll take care of it.
-All right.

102
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,640
-We're supposed to return half of it?
-That's right.

103
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,320
So, two baskets go back. Here.

104
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,160
Here it is.

105
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
As for

106
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,400
the gold and silver gate ceremony,
we can skip that.

107
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,040
-We already did it this morning.
-Yes.

108
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,320
Besides, I'm Thai,

109
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,760
so let's keep it simple and short.

110
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,000
Just enough to ease your mother's mind.

111
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Yes, Auntie.

112
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,280
Now go on,

113
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,120
bring your bride home.

114
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
Thank you.

115
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
Thank you.

116
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,800
You look so uniquely beautiful in that.

117
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,600
Like a Chinese daughter.

118
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,160
I hope your mother likes me.

119
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Of course.

120
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,400
When you love someone,

121
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,080
you must accept that person completely.

122
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,640
Loving Rawee
means loving everything about him,

123
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,200
not just the good parts.

124
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,520
No one is perfect.

125
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,560
Yes.

126
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,120
May your love last forever.

127
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,640
From today on,
you're part of this household.

128
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,720
You must follow our customs.

129
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,360
No more acting like a pampered Thai girl

130
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,840
from the stables.

131
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,160
As a wife, you must obey

132
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,040
and honor your husband,
and you will have a good life.

133
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,720
Remember that.

134
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Yes.

135
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,960
Thank you.

136
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,680
Wait.

137
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
Did you forget what I told you?

138
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,000
-It's okay, Mom.
-No.

139
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Do you want your wife
to control you for the rest of your life?

140
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Dad, you didn't do this to Mom
during your wedding, right?

141
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,200
The ceremony's over. Everyone, go now.

142
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,640
Go tell your madam

143
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,440
the bride must stay here
for three days before returning home.

144
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,960
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Let's call it even
for what I did this morning.

146
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,120
It's kind of silly, isn't it? Why does one
have to be above the other?

147
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,120
I think it should be about mutual respect.

148
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,640
Each of us can lead in what we're good at.

149
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,920
If one is wrong,
the other can correct them.

150
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,320
If one is right,
the other can support that.

151
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,360
I believe that's how
a husband and wife should live together.

152
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,800
I really didn't choose the wrong man.

153
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,200
And now, the moment
everyone's been waiting for has arrived.

154
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,640
Right now, I'm in control of the game.
No objections allowed.

155
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,960
Full support only.

156
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,560
The one in control
of the game just fell asleep.

157
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,720
Sleep well, okay?

158
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,520
I fully support you.

159
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Good night, my love.

160
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,400
It really suits your hand.

161
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
It fits perfectly.

162
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,240
Thank you.

163
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
Move in with me.

164
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,680
Yes.

165
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,720
-Thanks.
-Yes, Manager.

166
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,760
Do you think the ceremony's done by now?

167
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,400
Who cares?

168
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
We're staying at this hotel tonight.

169
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,240
Let's make the most
of what we're entitled to.

170
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,800
I still can't get over it.

171
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,160
She went too far today.

172
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,120
She humiliated me in front of everyone.

173
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,840
She could've spoken to me in private.

174
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,440
She's afraid I'll return to the mill
and take control again.

175
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,880
Did you see Duangporn's face?

176
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,280
She smirked at me. She's always wanted
to compete with me as the first in-law.

177
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,040
It's all right.

178
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,520
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

179
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,400
So what do we do next?

180
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,080
You have to endure for now.

181
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
I've already planned everything.

182
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
But for my plan to work,

183
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,080
I need your help.

184
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,560
Just tell me what to do. I'll do anything.

185
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,160
You need to go back
and ask your parents for help.

186
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
What help do you need from them?

187
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,600
You need to ask them to sell the land

188
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,240
they promised to give you.

189
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
We need the capital and shares

190
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,920
to buy out a business.

191
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,960
Are you tired?

192
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,240
Not from today.

193
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,200
But from now on, I don't know.

194
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Mom trusts you a lot.

195
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,680
She's handed over
all the family finances to you.

196
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,360
I'm her favorite daughter-in-law.
She picked me herself.

197
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
It's a lot of responsibility.
Can you handle it?

198
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
We've got to give it a shot.

199
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,880
That's the spirit. That's why you're fit
to be the first in-law of the house.

200
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,680
If I'm going to go against Chen and Hong,
you won't be mad, right?

201
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,880
If it were before, I would've asked you
to keep the peace for Dad's sake.

202
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,800
But after what he did at the hotel,

203
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,400
he never thought of me as a brother,
so why should I see him as one?

204
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,080
That's true.

205
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,880
There are only three of you.

206
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
Can I ask something?

207
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,680
Did Ronnakorn have a crush on Ranee?

208
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,880
You could tell?

209
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,000
It was kind of obvious.

210
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,400
Don't tell anyone, okay?

211
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,840
Those two met Ranee at the same time,

212
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,800
but she chose Rawee.

213
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
So Korn has been silently
in love with her all this time.

214
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,880
Poor guy. But what can you do?

215
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,560
That's why he skipped the wedding tonight.

216
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,640
From now on,
they have to live in the same house.

217
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't know how that's going to turn out.

218
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,480
Madam,

219
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,840
please get some rest.

220
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,680
I'll wait for Young Master myself.

221
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,040
Korn is getting worse these days.
He goes out without telling anyone at all.

222
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,800
He probably feels like he doesn't belong.

223
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,120
His brothers are all married,

224
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,360
and he still doesn't have a partner.

225
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,600
That might be it.

226
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,760
Looks like
I'll have to find him a wife soon.

227
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,800
I like you more
in this kind of dress and makeup.

228
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,840
When you wake up one day and see me
without makeup, you'll be shocked.

229
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
So when do I get to see that?

230
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
Are you really sure?

231
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,320
If you bring me home,

232
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,720
you're bound to run into trouble
with your parents.

233
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,240
If I run away to live with you

234
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,200
and never go back,

235
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,440
I'm sure that would be
a much bigger problem.

236
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,920
All right. Let's give it a shot.

237
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,880
I'll take some time off from the bar,

238
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,360
just in case it doesn't work out.
I don't want to be out of a job.

239
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,800
That's totally up to you.

240
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,880
When should I go with you?

241
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,720
How about today?

242
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't want to drive
long distances alone anymore.

243
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,680
And I don't want to sing at night
and come back to an empty room either.

244
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,920
How could you fall asleep?

245
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,400
We haven't finished the ceremony yet.

246
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
Turn off the lamp first.

247
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,440
It's too bright.

248
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,280
It's a blessing lamp. I can't turn it off.

249
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,000
Then,

250
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I'll make it dark myself.

251
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,560
Good morning.

252
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,200
Why are you watching me sleep?

253
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,280
I look awful.

254
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,040
You don't look awful at all.

255
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,560
Still just as cute.

256
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,120
No. I don't want you to see me like this.

257
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,240
It's almost time for breakfast.
Who wants to shower first?

258
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I do.

259
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,280
Come join us.

260
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,240
Can you eat

261
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,240
rice porridge like this?

262
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
Whether she can or not,
she'll have to learn.

263
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,120
We eat like this every day in this house.

264
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,600
I can. I don't usually have
breakfast anyway.

265
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,280
Where's your wife?

266
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,000
Still not up yet?

267
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,400
You really should teach
your wife some manners.

268
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,880
She's still adjusting, Mom.

269
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,360
The early bird gets the worm.

270
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Don't you remember what I taught you?

271
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,320
Yes, Mom.

272
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,200
I have high expectations for her.

273
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,440
Don't let me down.

274
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,560
She should carry herself

275
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,240
like a proper first daughter-in-law.

276
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,320
Yes, Mom.

277
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm full.

278
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,320
I'll go check on work.

279
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960
Are you done?

280
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
Go accompany your dad in Korn's place.

281
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,600
No need.

282
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,640
I'll go with Prajak. You all keep eating.

283
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,480
Korn doesn't know his responsibilities.

284
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,120
When he gets back,
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

285
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,640
He's always out and about.

286
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,480
Hello, this is Master Jiw's house.

287
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,640
Is it Korn?

288
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,240
It's Mr. Rawee's friend.

289
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,040
Did you sleep well in the new place?

290
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
I slept well.

291
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,760
Wee didn't keep you up all night, did he?

292
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Rak.

293
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,800
Watch your mouth.

294
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,040
You know I don't like crude jokes.

295
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
It's all right, Mom.

296
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,280
So you like

297
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,760
men talking dirty to you, is that it?

298
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,560
Good to know.

299
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,320
It just so happens that this man is Rak.

300
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,760
I didn't take offense,

301
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,760
and I trust you've raised him well

302
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,680
to know
how to speak respectfully to women.

303
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,120
Who was it?

304
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,840
A friend, Mom. He couldn't come yesterday,
so he wants to meet today.

305
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,440
So Ranee and I will head out for a bit.

306
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,400
She's not a pushover.

307
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,800
She's sharp-tongued just like her aunt.

308
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,600
Sorry I couldn't stay
for the ceremony yesterday.

309
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,360
You already attended the Thai one.
It's all right.

310
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,520
These are my brother and sister-in-law.

311
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,679
And this

312
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,560
is Chomechawee, my wife.

313
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,800
What are you doing here?

314
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,600
You've used tradition to prevent
my niece from returning home.

315
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,120
So I've come to see her.

316
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Or will you forbid that too?

317
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,080
Even prisoners are allowed visitors.

318
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,880
You've only missed her for one night.

319
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,200
Are you going to die from it?

320
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,640
Well,

321
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,320
I don't have three or four kids
to spread my love around like you.

322
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,840
Your niece isn't home.

323
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,400
Where'd she go?

324
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,000
I didn't ask. She went out with Rawee.

325
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,120
Oh?

326
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,680
She's not allowed back home,

327
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,880
but she can go out with him?

328
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,080
How strange.

329
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,280
Do you really think she'd listen
even if I forbade her?

330
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,760
It seems like she's been spoiled rotten.

331
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,440
That must be how she has been raised.

332
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Just leave your things with Ngor.

333
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,600
Here, Auntie.

334
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,080
Hey.

335
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,440
Aren't you going to invite me in?

336
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,040
I have something to discuss with you.

337
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
The air is so fresh.

338
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,480
I've been thinking…
I kind of want to stay here longer.

339
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,240
It's private and peaceful.

340
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,720
Is Korn's mother

341
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,080
very strict?

342
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,000
If she weren't,
the boys wouldn't be under control.

343
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,040
That's true.

344
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,640
So,

345
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,360
what should I call you?

346
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
Just call me Ranee.

347
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,080
Then please call me Chome.

348
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,240
All right.

349
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,560
But once you're in the house,
you'll have to call me sister

350
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,600
to avoid any trouble.

351
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,320
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

352
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,360
Got it.

353
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,680
But I might have to stay
in this house forever.

354
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,520
Korn's family probably won't accept me.

355
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,400
Why not?

356
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,400
I don't have much education,

357
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,680
no family,

358
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,680
and I work at a nightclub.

359
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,520
There's nothing about me
that's worthy of Korn.

360
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,720
Refusing to go home like I did

361
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,480
isn't going to work for you, Korn.

362
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,240
I think so too.

363
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
I'm not as capable as you. And my wife

364
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,880
doesn't have qualifications
like Ranee does.

365
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm more likely to get disowned.

366
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,360
We need to talk to Dad.

367
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,120
He might be able
to help speak with Mom for you.

368
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,920
But it all comes down to you.

369
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,920
How serious are you about Chome?

370
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
Is it just casual,
or are you thinking of marrying her?

371
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm marrying her.

372
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,000
Even if Mom refuses to hold a ceremony,

373
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,680
I'll acknowledge her as my wife.

374
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,080
If that's your decision,
then let her stay here for now.

375
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,200
We'll figure out how to break it to Mom.

376
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,320
Say what you came to say.

377
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,840
I want Cha-aim
to move in here to look after Ranee.

378
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,760
My house is full of maids already.

379
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,720
Why should I pay more?

380
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,360
I'll pay her wages myself.

381
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,000
I won't burden you.

382
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,200
As for meals,

383
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,160
if there are any extra expenses,
just let me know.

384
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,680
We cook a lot here.

385
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,200
There's always food left for the dogs.

386
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,720
Let her eat all she wants.

387
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,160
-Anything else?
-Yes.

388
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,320
I want Tub to drive Ranee.

389
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,680
It'll be my car.

390
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,120
I'll handle gas

391
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
and his wages.

392
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Well, well.

393
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,520
How very upper-class.

394
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,520
She has to be surrounded
by servants, right?

395
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Who's here?

396
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,080
Miss Ranee's aunt.
I don't know what it's about.

397
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,800
Are you bringing anyone else?

398
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,960
Yes.

399
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,720
Chanraem.

400
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,600
Tub's married.

401
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,120
He'll have to come with his wife.

402
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,680
It's not right

403
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,920
to split them up.

404
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,960
You want your driver to live in my house?

405
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,280
Isn't that a bit much?

406
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,640
Just leave the car here.
Ranee can drive, can't she?

407
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,640
She can,

408
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,760
but I worry.

409
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,160
Tub and his wife will only be here
from time to time.

410
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,920
If there's nothing important,
they won't stay.

411
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,320
Your house is huge.

412
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,280
I believe there's
a spare room or two for servants.

413
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,840
There is. If you want to move in,

414
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,760
Ngor's room has two beds.

415
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,360
Why would I want to move into your house?

416
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,040
That's all, right?

417
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,760
Next time, learn some manners
and schedule a visit.

418
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,040
Just because we're in-laws

419
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,920
doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.

420
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,400
-Cha-aim!
-Yes, ma'am?

421
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,720
We're leaving.

422
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,960
You really don't have to come with me.

423
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,040
I'm not going to be there every day.

424
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,680
No. Wherever you are, I'll be with you.

425
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,600
Chan.

426
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,240
If you met someone you loved more than me,

427
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,280
would you leave me?

428
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm your wife.
I won't love anyone more than you.

429
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,600
All right.

430
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Mom.

431
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,960
Why are you letting Chanraem stay with us?

432
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,720
They're husband and wife.

433
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,400
If I refuse, Pissamai will get suspicious.

434
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,840
It's not like she'll be staying every day.

435
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,160
But what if she moves back in

436
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,320
and regains her memory?

437
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
Then just tell her it's not true.

438
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,400
She's pregnant with her husband's child.
It has nothing to do with you.

439
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,360
You're the one who needs to act normal.

440
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm just worried about Duangporn.
She might already suspect something.

441
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,000
Come on. I've given her
so much power in this house.

442
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,040
She should be able to overlook this.

443
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,240
Come with me.

444
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,720
I'll show you all the properties we have,
buildings for rent,

445
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,680
and the ones we bought to flip.

446
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,040
Yes, Mom.

447
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,280
-All good, sir?
-No issues.

448
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,360
What's wrong, sir?

449
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,320
My heart feels a bit off.

450
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,200
-Do you want to go to the hospital?
-I'll be fine.

451
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,680
I went up and down those stairs
and walked back to the car.

452
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,880
It's probably
just too much for an old man.

453
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,160
I'm just tired.

454
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,880
-Are you sure you're all right?
-Yeah. Just drive home.

455
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Yes, sir.

456
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,680
This is the income
and expense ledger for this year.

457
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,920
All the receipts are in that box.

458
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,720
And last year's?

459
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,800
No need to be so enthusiastic.

460
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,560
Just finish this batch first.

461
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,560
Then get someone to bring it to the house.

462
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,720
Huh? You're not working here?

463
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,040
No. This place is old,
cramped, and uncomfortable.

464
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,960
It's not ideal for work.

465
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,920
From now on,
send any documents to the house.

466
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,320
It's close enough.
It won't waste anyone's time.

467
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,480
That rich girl, so fake and lazy.

468
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,760
Try waking up early before dreaming big.

469
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,480
Up to which month did you
give her the documents?

470
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,160
-Good.
-Are you sure she won't find out?

471
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,040
Don't worry.
I've planned every escape route.

472
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,600
You just take care of your gold shop.

473
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,640
I'll handle the rice mill.

474
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,720
I have to go.
Let's talk again this evening.

475
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,080
Come in.

476
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,920
MANAGER'S OFFICE

477
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,120
All department managers
are confirmed for the meeting.

478
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,200
Tell all purchasing departments.

479
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,040
If they have any procurement plans,

480
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,720
they need to submit them by this month.

481
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,000
If I'm still in charge,
I'll approve everything.

482
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,120
Yes, sir.

483
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,360
Cha-aim?

484
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,480
How did you get here?

485
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,800
I came with Madam.

486
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,880
She's inside?

487
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,160
She already left, but she assigned me
to take care of you here.

488
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,640
Really?

489
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,480
My mom agreed to that?

490
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,120
Yes. She came to talk in person.

491
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,240
And it's not just me.
Tub will be your driver too.

492
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,120
That's great. I won't be lonely now.

493
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,480
Oh, come on.

494
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,680
You were lonely with me around?

495
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,160
It's different.

496
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,400
At this house,
I don't have anyone on my side.

497
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,080
By the way, Cha-aim,
has my dad come back yet?

498
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,160
Yes, he has.

499
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,120
I'll go talk to him now.

500
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,040
Okay.

501
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,480
Dad, are you asleep?

502
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,720
No, come in.

503
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,320
Sit down. Go on, sit.

504
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,720
I'm not disturbing your nap, am I?

505
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,800
I was just resting.

506
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,640
What is it?

507
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,920
I wanted to talk to you about Korn.

508
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,960
What's he done this time?

509
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,160
He has a lover now.

510
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,480
Then tell him to bring her over
to meet your mom and me.

511
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,160
That's the issue, Dad.

512
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,480
His girlfriend is
a nightclub singer in Bangkok.

513
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,280
Is he actually serious about her?

514
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,280
He wants to marry her
and bring her to live here.

515
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,560
Do they really know
each other well enough?

516
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,320
Do you think there's a way
to get Mom to accept her?

517
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,760
You should be resting
if you're not feeling well.

518
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,760
Why did you come down?

519
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,200
It's a welcome dinner
for our new daughter-in-law.

520
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,120
Everyone's here.

521
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,040
How could I not be here?

522
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,960
If anything feels uncomfortable,
just say it.

523
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,240
Our family's simple,

524
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,600
no need for formality.

525
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,240
-Yes.
-Just take your time adjusting.

526
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,400
With all these servants swarming around,

527
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,600
if she still can't adjust,

528
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,680
I don't know what to say.

529
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,640
Everyone else seems fine.

530
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,760
There's no issue at all.

531
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,640
Shall we eat? I'm hungry.

532
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,320
Let's dig in.

533
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Where's Korn?

534
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,000
Everyone's here.

535
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,000
How could I possibly miss it?

536
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,360
Speak of the devil. Come, have a seat.

537
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,640
Chome.

538
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,840
This is my dad and mom.

539
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,400
Hello.

540
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,120
These are my brothers and sisters-in-law.

541
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,200
Let me see your ring.

542
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,400
Follow me.

543
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,520
Not you. Stay right there.

544
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,120
Come with me.

545
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,400
This is the kind of family
I've always dreamed of.

546
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,200
Why were you in such a rush?

547
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,760
How long have you known Korn?

548
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,120
Just a few weeks.

549
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,440
Have you slept together yet?

550
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,240
Don't you dare lie to me.

551
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,840
Yes.

552
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,840
Are you pregnant?

553
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,800
Tell me the truth.

554
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,200
No, I'm not pregnant.

555
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,280
Rawee came to talk to me this afternoon.

556
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,320
You could've waited.

557
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,160
If you were going to act recklessly,

558
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,920
you didn't have to bother
asking me to meet you.

559
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,760
So I'm the only one who didn't know?

560
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,520
I've thought it over.

561
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,520
Mom will never accept Chome anyway.

562
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,840
Why not?

563
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,960
Is she poor?

564
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,640
That's not a problem. We're rich.

565
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,520
She doesn't have Chinese heritage?

566
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,760
But Ranee doesn't either.

567
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,400
Or she didn't graduate?

568
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,880
Or is she an illegitimate child

569
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,200
or an orphan?

570
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
Something like that.

571
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,120
Mom probably thinks

572
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,840
Chome's not suitable for me in every way.

573
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,040
When people love each other,

574
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,560
it's the heart that matters.

575
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,480
Yes.

576
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,520
Love is love.

577
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,520
Everything else comes after.

578
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,600
Do you have a job?

579
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,680
-Yes.
-What do you do?

580
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,000
Spit it out.

581
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,680
I asked what you do.

582
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,640
I'm a singer.

583
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,480
A singer? One of those bar girls?

584
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,840
I'm going to marry Chome.

585
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,640
Mom, stop dictating. Stop putting
your own will above everyone else's.

586
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,360
-Korn, come back here!
-Korn.

587
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,000
Dad.

588
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,560
He seems smarter than the rest.
He could ruin our plan.

589
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,080
Manager, something's happened.

590
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,720
There's a hotshot newcomer
heading to the company.

591
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,240
Don't let him get there.

592
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,000
<i>But if he's smart enough,</i>

593
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,720
he should know to stay out of it.

594
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,600
-Chat?
-Yes, it's me.

595
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,120
-Korn!
-Come back to Bangkok with me!

596
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,640
No. I'm not going back!

597
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,160
