1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,560
I love Rawee. I don't think
I can stop loving him, Auntie.

2
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Even if you love each other to death,
you'll never end up together.

3
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,080
You have to help me. Madam once tried
to poison me to cause a miscarriage.

4
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,720
But it didn't work.

5
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,880
I don't think she'll stop there.

6
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,000
<i>She's heavily pregnant. I'm scared</i>
<i>she might die with the baby, ma'am.</i>

7
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,800
Maybe fate…
is sparing Rak from misfortune.

8
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
Ranee?

9
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
<i>Welcome home, Son.</i>

10
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,600
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560
Just finished.

12
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,920
Oh, Korn.

13
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,160
Where's Rawee?

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,440
He went out to buy eggs. We ran out.

15
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,800
It smells so good.

16
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,160
It's just regular fried rice.
Come eat with us.

17
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,080
With a smell like this, I would've
invited myself even if you hadn't asked.

18
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Here's the plate.

19
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,520
Let's hope it tastes as good as it looks.

20
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,880
I'm sure it does.

21
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,520
Is this enough?

22
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,240
Yes.

23
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,200
Eggs are here!

24
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,040
Korn. I thought
you were going out with your friends.

25
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,320
They flaked.

26
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,400
So,

27
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,560
lucky me.
I came back to a delicious surprise.

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,920
Smells amazing.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,920
Do you want a fried egg on top?

30
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
That would make it perfect.

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
Three fried eggs, please.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
I'll handle it myself.

33
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,120
What a tough job.

34
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,520
Fried eggs, not omelets, Chef.

35
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,840
Ah, right…

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,720
Well, I get nervous around pretty women.

37
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
Crack new ones.

38
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,120
So, omelet it is?

39
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,640
Fried eggs.

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
It's been a while.

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,200
We'll be seeing each other
more often from now on.

42
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,680
You've grown
into such a tall and handsome young man.

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,520
Just like his father.

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,960
Right.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,920
Where's Duangporn?

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Don't rush, dear.

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,280
She ran into a friend just outside
and stopped to say hi.

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,160
There she is.

49
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,880
Good evening.

50
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Good evening.

51
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,520
You woke up just in time.

52
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,640
I was just heading out.

53
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
Where's Rawee?

54
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,880
He went to get notes from a friend.

55
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
You were asleep.

56
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
He didn't want to wake you.

57
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
Did I sleep long?

58
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,320
What are you doing?

59
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,600
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,400
I couldn't stop myself.

61
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Don't ever do that again.

62
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,000
I like you.

63
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,000
I've liked you since the first day we met.

64
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,520
But I backed off

65
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,720
because I knew Rawee liked you too…

66
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
even though we met you at the same time.

67
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,600
Why are you saying this?

68
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,120
What for?

69
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,600
I just wanted you to know.

70
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
To make me uncomfortable?

71
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,600
You know I'm with Rawee

72
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,840
and love him very much.

73
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
I appreciate your feelings,

74
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,520
but don't put me in a position where
I'm the reason two brothers fall out.

75
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Let's pretend this never happened.

76
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
Ranee.

77
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,800
Are you okay?

78
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,520
I just ran into a stern-looking foreigner.
I got a bit scared.

79
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,760
-You're heading home, right?
-Yes.

80
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,160
Okay. I'll walk you back.

81
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
I overheard the hotel staff
gossiping with my own ears, Hong.

82
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Her son just graduated
and has no work experience.

83
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,520
How can they trust him
to manage such a big hotel?

84
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Exactly. Your husband
has a proven track record.

85
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Even the rice mill
has had to expand again and again.

86
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,520
He should be promoted before anyone else.

87
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,960
It's all because of that Madam Mei.

88
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
We've been doing business for a long time.

89
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Of course,
I'll prioritize your order before others.

90
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,400
Yes, don't worry. It'll be ready in time.

91
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,480
All right, goodbye.

92
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,360
Are you busy?

93
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,480
I just solved all the problems, Dad.

94
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,240
I brought two land deeds
for you to choose from.

95
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,720
What is it for, Dad?

96
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,160
To build your new house, of course.

97
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,760
Are you worried I'll be upset that Rak
was chosen to manage the hotel?

98
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
You heard?

99
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
It's the talk of the market. Everyone says

100
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,520
someone with my experience

101
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,280
should've been chosen
over a fresh graduate.

102
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,320
They clearly don't believe
blood is thicker than water.

103
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
Rak has a management degree from the US.

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,120
What makes him unfit to manage a hotel?

105
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,760
Chen's just worried
his brother lacks experience.

106
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,440
So, you have to manage a rice mill

107
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,520
before you can run a hotel now?

108
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,160
Ridiculous.

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
Are we done here?
We'll be late for our appointment.

110
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
All right.

111
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
Just pick the plot you want.

112
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,040
Take them back, Dad.
I don't want any of it.

113
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
How arrogant.

114
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,160
A bit of success

115
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,880
and you puff up like a toad.

116
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,760
If he doesn't want it,
just don't give it to him.

117
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,480
Don't bother coddling him.
If he's going to sulk, let him.

118
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,840
He came here with nothing. It's already
a blessing he's made it this far.

119
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
If you change your mind, let me know.

120
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,040
Let's just hope Rak knows what he's doing.

121
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,680
Don't come begging me to step in later.

122
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,840
I have three sons.

123
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,360
Let's see

124
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,000
if none of them can do better than someone

125
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,960
without an education like you.

126
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on, we're late. Let's go.

127
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,560
Chan.

128
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,480
Don't run or you'll fall.

129
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,320
Chan!

130
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,800
Hey!

131
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
Sorry. Chan, don't run!

132
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,200
Why are you so shy?

133
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,760
We're husband and wife, aren't we?

134
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,160
Please don't, Mr. Rak.

135
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,400
Is there something wrong?

136
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm sorry. My wife isn't feeling well.

137
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,560
Who was that?
She looked like she knew you.

138
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,040
She must've mistaken me for someone else.

139
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
Her husband said she was unwell.

140
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Let's go.

141
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,120
How about dinner by the river?

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,120
Sounds great.

143
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,280
Do you know who Duangporn's family is?

144
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,320
I thought you knew.

145
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
She's the daughter of Master Pong,

146
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,720
the textile mill owner.

147
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,120
He spent four or five years

148
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
studying overseas.

149
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,560
Now he's a hotel owner.

150
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,280
That's enough, dear.

151
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,040
Eat something.

152
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,480
He and I are both Dad's sons.

153
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,400
So why does he always get more than me?

154
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
You eat. I've lost my appetite.

155
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
-Please.
-Thank you.

156
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,760
Let me open it for you.

157
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,839
Thank you so much, Mr. Rak.

158
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,600
Bye-bye.

159
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
I'll close it for you.

160
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,520
-Brother.
-Yeah?

161
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm going back to Thailand.

162
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,840
What?

163
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm dropping out and going home.

164
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
Are you crazy?

165
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,680
You're halfway through your degree.

166
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm sick of it.

167
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,040
I don't want to study anymore.

168
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,400
We have plenty of businesses back home.

169
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,280
Even without a degree,
I'll still have work.

170
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,120
Korn,

171
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
if Mom finds out, she'll be furious.

172
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,840
Then don't let her find out yet.

173
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
Think it through, Korn.

174
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,760
Just hang in there a bit longer.

175
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,560
I've thought it through.

176
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,800
Are you upset with me or something?

177
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,800
I told you I'm just sick of it.
I don't want to study anymore.

178
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,520
-Is there anything I can do to--
-Yes, there is.

179
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,720
Don't stop me.

180
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
Korn.

181
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,320
Korn.

182
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,920
-Mom, is the wound serious?
-No, no, just a small one.

183
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,640
Can you describe the attacker?

184
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,000
Not at all.

185
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,840
I was bending down
to take a branch out of the road…

186
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
then I blacked out.

187
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,920
Do you have any enemies?
Someone who might hold a grudge?

188
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,200
I just got back from America.
I haven't even met anyone yet.

189
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,040
None of my friends even know I'm back.

190
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
Do you suspect anyone?

191
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
A bit of success
and you puff up like a toad.

192
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,040
Don't bother coddling him.
If he's going to sulk, let him.

193
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
He came here with nothing.

194
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
It's already a blessing
he's made it this far.

195
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,360
Let's just hope Rak knows what he's doing.

196
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,800
Don't come begging me to step in later.

197
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
I have three sons.

198
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,040
Let's see if none of them

199
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,680
can do better than someone
without an education like you.

200
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,440
Do you suspect anyone?

201
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,520
Not really.

202
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't want to accuse anyone

203
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,440
without clear evidence.

204
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,360
Where have you been?

205
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,280
I was feeling down,

206
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,440
so I went for drinks with the workers.

207
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,600
Don't overthink.

208
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,200
Let him do his thing. He won't last.

209
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,800
He's a fresh graduate with no experience.

210
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,760
What can he possibly know?

211
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't trust Chen.

212
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,760
He wouldn't hurt his own brother.

213
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,920
Dear.

214
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,720
You can say that
because you're his father.

215
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,480
But he doesn't see Rak as his brother.

216
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Jealousy makes people blind.
They'll do anything.

217
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,840
I admit he's smart,

218
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,680
sharp, and knows how to talk.
People like working with him.

219
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,480
But I won't support him any further.

220
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,920
Chen knows his place.
That's why he's always been careful.

221
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Knows his place?

222
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,160
If it's not him,
I can't think of anyone else

223
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,800
who'd attack Rak.

224
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,640
Tub.

225
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
You're back.

226
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Why aren't you asleep?

227
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
I wanted to hug you before bed.

228
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,320
Go to sleep. I'll take a shower first.

229
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,760
Okay.

230
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,160
Tub. Where have you been?

231
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,760
Why didn't you take me?

232
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,040
Finishing something
I should've done long ago.

233
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,720
I don't understand.

234
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Don't try to. Just go to sleep.

235
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Okay.

236
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,280
Safe travels, Korn.

237
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Thanks for coming.

238
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
Just a little more
and we'll both graduate.

239
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,880
We'll see each other again soon.

240
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,320
You talk like I'll miss you.

241
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,280
You'll just be lonely without me.

242
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
I've got Ranee.

243
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,880
I won't be lonely.

244
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
I think my ride's here. I'll go and check.

245
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,280
Let's go.

246
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
Are you sure
Korn won't tell your mom about us?

247
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,320
We three siblings
always protect each other.

248
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,400
You don't have to worry.

249
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,480
Dad, Mom.

250
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,080
Young Master…

251
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,600
Korn?

252
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,600
Why are you back?

253
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Just two more years and you'd graduate.
Can't you hang in there?

254
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,760
I'm really tired of it, Mom.
I don't want to study anymore.

255
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
I missed Dad.

256
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,800
I missed you.

257
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,080
And I missed Thailand.

258
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,760
Don't try to butter me up.

259
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,240
You didn't finish your degree
and came home to embarrass me.

260
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,800
We should've come back together.

261
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
Rak!

262
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,760
What did you say? You should be
encouraging him to finish school,

263
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,040
not this nonsense.

264
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,680
Mom, he doesn't want to study.
Forcing him would just waste money.

265
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,960
Exactly!

266
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,320
And we have plenty of family businesses.

267
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,920
He won't be jobless.

268
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
See? He gets it!

269
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,400
Stop right there.

270
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,000
This is serious,
and you're not even a little remorseful?

271
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,200
Dear, I give up on him. You deal with him.

272
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,560
He's your precious son.

273
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,800
He didn't want to study,
and he's already home.

274
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,720
Then, help Rak with the hotel.

275
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,760
Thank you, Dad.

276
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,760
You always understand me best.

277
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,960
You two, work together to grow the hotel.

278
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,000
Make it famous across the country.

279
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,200
-Yes, Dad.
-Yes, Dad.

280
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,360
What a trio.
Father and his two golden boys.

281
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,240
Thank you, Mom.

282
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,720
I love you too.

283
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
I missed you.

284
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
Did you wait long?

285
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,720
Rawee?

286
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,680
What is this?

287
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
What's the occasion?

288
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,800
Is it a birthday?

289
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,440
No.

290
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,040
The day we met?

291
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,200
No.

292
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,160
What's going on with you?

293
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
I want to ask you to marry me.

294
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,560
What?

295
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,440
We haven't even graduated yet.

296
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,240
I'm scared that if my family finds out,

297
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,120
we'll be forced apart.

298
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,000
Are you afraid Korn might let it slip?

299
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,880
There are no secrets in this world,
even if he doesn't say anything.

300
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,320
Can you promise me,

301
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
no matter what happens,

302
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,200
you'll marry only me?

303
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,320
I never planned on
being anyone else's bride.

304
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,680
Then as soon as we graduate,

305
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,400
let's get married at a church and have
a priest officiate. Wouldn't that be nice?

306
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,160
Yes.

307
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,680
Your name's Duangporn, right?

308
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,280
Yes.

309
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,360
I'm Hongyok, the first daughter-in-law.

310
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,639
I see.

311
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,840
I feel like we've met before.

312
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,239
Yes, my mother
often shops at your gold store.

313
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,400
Sometimes, I go with her.

314
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,440
We'll probably be family soon.

315
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,120
I don't know if Mr. Rak
is really serious about me.

316
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
Oh course, he'll choose you.

317
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,480
You're beautiful, rich,

318
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,320
well-rounded, unlike his ex-wife.

319
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,719
His ex-wife?

320
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,040
It's nothing. I'll head inside now.

321
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,280
Wait.

322
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,480
Can you tell me?

323
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
I feel like Mr. Rak
is hiding something from me too.

324
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,760
Even Madam Mei
seems oddly rushed about our wedding.

325
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,200
She's probably afraid you'll find out
something and change your mind.

326
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,400
What is it? Please tell me.

327
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,280
I'd better not. I might lose my head.

328
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,120
Madam already hates me enough.

329
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,360
Let's just pretend
you didn't hear anything.

330
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,840
Please tell me.

331
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,880
Tell me know the truth
before it's too late.

332
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,680
Fine, but you have to promise

333
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,280
you won't tell anyone
that you heard it from me.

334
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,040
Yes, I promise.

335
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,720
What made you come back so suddenly?

336
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,920
I just got sick of it.
I didn't feel like studying anymore.

337
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't buy that.

338
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,120
-I missed you.
-Hey.

339
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,040
Save that charm for your dad.

340
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,440
You couldn't stand
feeling unwanted, could you?

341
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,400
Right? I knew it.

342
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
You know, don't you?

343
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Even though I'm not in love
with Ranee like you are,

344
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,280
seeing those two all lovey-dovey

345
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,160
still makes me jealous.

346
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
And Ranee

347
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,640
is getting prettier every day.

348
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Don't mention it.

349
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,480
If she weren't already with Rawee,
I wouldn't have backed off so easily.

350
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,400
Come on.

351
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,320
It's all right. We're brothers.

352
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
Let's not fight over a girl.

353
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,600
That's what I think too.

354
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,920
Dad always said
brothers are like arms and legs.

355
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,880
Don't worry.
You won't stay single for long.

356
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,440
Mom will be setting you up
with blind dates every weekend soon.

357
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,720
Anyway,

358
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,200
how about Miss Duangporn?

359
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,040
How was she?

360
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,080
She seems modern and really beautiful.

361
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,040
She's the one. I'll admit

362
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,320
Mom has good taste.

363
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,320
She's perfect. And we really clicked.

364
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,560
I'm happy for you.

365
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,000
What about Chanraem?

366
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,520
Did you see her again?

367
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,440
Just once, at the flea market.

368
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,560
How is she?

369
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,400
She seemed okay.
Almost recovered, I guess.

370
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,560
She got married to her ex.

371
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,480
But she didn't remember me.

372
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,760
That's for the best.

373
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,200
That past isn't worth remembering.

374
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,240
Yeah. It's better for everyone.

375
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,680
I wish I could forget the past too.

376
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,520
Wait, please! Wait!

377
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,080
Master wanted you
to take the offerings home.

378
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,960
Hong!

379
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,920
Hey! Why did you slap her?

380
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,760
One slap is too little

381
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,040
for that nosy, foul-mouthed woman!

382
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,600
Duangporn.

383
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,800
What did she do wrong

384
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,240
that you have to slap
and yell at her like this?

385
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,160
Ask your wife
what she blabbed about to Duangporn!

386
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,000
We talked, and I slipped.

387
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,680
You think this is something
you can just let slip?

388
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,920
The matter of Chanraem
and Rak is long over.

389
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,760
Everyone knows

390
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
she and her husband

391
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,960
scammed Rak

392
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,000
and passed their kid off
as my grandchild for money.

393
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,120
If that's the truth,

394
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,440
why are you so afraid
of Duangporn finding out?

395
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,320
Or is it not true?

396
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,200
Rak got Chanraem pregnant,

397
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,040
and you planned to get rid of the baby.

398
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,800
You two get out of my house now.

399
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't ever set foot here again,

400
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,560
not for ancestral rites or anything!

401
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,120
Get out!

402
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,560
One day,

403
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,280
you'll beg me to come back.

404
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,960
Never!

405
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,040
Don't be so full of yourself.

406
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,360
That success
that made your father so proud?

407
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,760
It was because I gave you a chance.

408
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,880
The rice mill
was your father's first business

409
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,680
before he met me.

410
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,280
That's why I let you run it.

411
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,840
But I was involved
in every other business!

412
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,240
Don't hope for anything beyond your worth.

413
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,760
As long as I'm still breathing,

414
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,960
even if all my children die,

415
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,760
I will never hand over
my businesses to you.

416
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,880
Get out!

417
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,720
Ouch!

418
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
How rude!

419
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
Let's go, Hong.

420
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,040
If either of them sets foot here again,
pour boiling water on them!

421
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,520
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,200
I'm the real first daughter-in-law,
not you.

423
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,120
You seem to have
a good appetite today, sir.

424
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,240
My sons are here eating with me.
It makes everything taste better.

425
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,640
Mom might get jealous if she hears that.

426
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,400
I won't. We've been together so long.

427
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,200
As long as you don't bring
a mistress to dinner, I'm fine.

428
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,120
I still want to die peacefully.
I wouldn't dare!

429
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,000
Anyway, you two

430
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,160
helping out at the hotel is great.

431
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,120
I can finally step back.

432
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,120
What, Dad? You're still young and active.
Why step back now?

433
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,480
So I can finally pursue my dream.

434
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,640
You still haven't given up on that?

435
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,400
No.

436
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,000
What is it you want to do, Dad?

437
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,520
I want to open the province's

438
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,680
first movie theater.

439
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,800
Really?

440
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,200
When I was in the US,

441
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,000
I loved going to the movies.

442
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,200
It's true.
He went to the movies more than to class.

443
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,920
There! I caught you.

444
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,960
You got me in trouble again!

445
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
We fully support you, Dad.

446
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
You've done everything for us
all your life.

447
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,520
Now it's your turn to do what you want.

448
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,720
We'll take over
running the hotel together.

449
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,800
You two are a good team.

450
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,160
Thank you, both.
Now that you've promised like this,

451
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
I can step back with peace of mind.

452
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,600
Get out! Get out!

453
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,600
Get out! Get out!

454
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
GET OUT

455
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,280
Today, we say no to the two brothers!

456
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,440
Get out!

457
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,560
-Bloodsucking bosses!
-Get out!

458
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,400
-Fools acting smart!
-Get out!

459
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,760
-The two brothers!
-Get out!

460
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,160
Get out! Get out!

461
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,680
-Got a bolt? Secure it with three locks.
-There's no bolt.

462
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,760
Get out.

463
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,680
Should we just go out
and talk it out with them?

464
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,320
You go if you want.
I'm not going out there.

465
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,840
Let's just apologize and put an end to it.
They'll calm down and get back to work.

466
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,680
I think they'll beat us up first.

467
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,800
We increased the workload, cut pay,
and fired people, including their friends.

468
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,560
Well, they were inefficient.
Why keep them?

469
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,680
Exactly. They just can't handle the truth,

470
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,640
so they gang up and protest.

471
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,640
Mob mentality.

472
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,360
Yes.

473
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,280
-Get out!
-Get out!

474
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,440
-Leave the country! Get out!
-Get out!

475
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,840
Could it escalate to violence
against the young masters?

476
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,360
Why would you even say that?
I'm already worried sick!

477
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,480
I'm sorry.
I'm just really concerned for them.

478
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,000
Thanks.

479
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,160
Please keep me updated immediately.

480
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,440
Dear, how was it?

481
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,520
The protest is still ongoing.

482
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
What about our sons?

483
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,960
They're hiding in the office.

484
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,960
I've posted a guard at the door.

485
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,160
Can the police help get them out?

486
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,840
They probably can't get in.

487
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,840
The employees have blocked
every entrance and exit.

488
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,200
Is there any way to negotiate with them?

489
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,200
We'll have to wait for them to cool down.

490
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,000
They were heavily affected
by our sons' policies.

491
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,440
Then why didn't you stop them

492
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,320
before they implemented all this?

493
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,960
They didn't consult me on everything.

494
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,280
They've been hiding things
and acting without telling anyone.

495
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,160
Can you speak
to the staff yourself, Master?

496
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,480
I'm afraid they won't listen.

497
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,480
They think I'm behind all the policies,

498
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,720
and Rak and Korn are just puppets.

499
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,880
Is there anyone else they might listen to?

500
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,840
There might be one person

501
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,760
they'll listen to.

502
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,800
Who?

503
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,880
Chen.

504
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,120
What does he have to do with it?

505
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,840
The head of HR said several
protest leaders used to work with Chen.

506
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,200
If we ask Chen to mediate,
they might be willing to listen.

507
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,520
This must be Chen's plan.

508
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,120
Exactly!

509
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,760
Do you have a better idea?

510
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,760
If we let the protest drag on,

511
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,560
our hotel's reputation will suffer.

512
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,960
Master and Madam asked me
to come speak with you.

513
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,360
They'd like you
to help mediate with the hotel staff.

514
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,320
Madam must have stopped Dad
from calling me, right?

515
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,040
I'm busy.

516
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,560
What does he want in return?

517
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,520
I don't know. He just said
he was busy and went back to work.

518
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,280
I should have called him
in the first place.

519
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,280
Dear, you're his father.
You own the rice mill.

520
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,800
You appointed him manager.

521
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,600
You're the owner. Do you have to beg

522
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,960
your own subordinate? It's ridiculous!

523
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,920
Stop it with your pride.

524
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,040
We're in a crisis here.

525
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,120
I had someone look into it.

526
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,720
The protest leaders know me well.

527
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,040
They are old subordinates,
workers from other mills,

528
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,560
and employees of our clients.

529
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,560
They respect me.

530
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,360
If I step in, they might listen.

531
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,520
Then I'll need your help to talk to them.

532
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,960
Just consider it a favor to your brothers.

533
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,560
This isn't a small matter, Dad.

534
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,360
If I'm going to speak on their behalf,

535
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,720
I have to stand by what I say,

536
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,880
or I'll lose their trust.

537
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,040
I understand.

538
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,320
If you want my help,
we need to make a deal.

539
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,080
What do you want? Say it.

540
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,120
First condition,
if I'm to fix the mess they made,

541
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,800
I'll need to take over operations
until everything is back on track.

542
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,160
All right. What's the second?

543
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,760
Hongyok and I

544
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,360
will move into your house.

545
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,120
Are you crazy? I will never accept

546
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,920
that man walking around our home.

547
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,760
No way!

548
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,480
The house is big enough.
We could always build another one.

549
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,080
So you really want him
to live here, don't you?

550
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,240
I told you I just want
to grow old and die peacefully.

551
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,080
Who wants to sit around
listening to people fight

552
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,480
and throw barbs at each other all day?

553
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
It's exhausting.

554
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,360
I don't care.

555
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,000
There must be another way
to solve this without begging him.

556
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
Mr. Rak's in there, right?

557
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,480
You can't go in.

558
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,600
If we can't go in,
then come out and face us!

559
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,920
Mr. Rak!

560
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,320
You go talk to them for me.

561
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,040
They want you, not me.

562
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,840
It's the same thing!

563
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,760
If you don't come out,
we'll break the door down!

564
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,040
Bro.

565
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,080
Bro?

566
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,640
How can you get away with it alone?

567
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,320
Mr. Rak!

568
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,760
You can't reach them?

569
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,520
It seems like the line's been cut.

570
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,000
Is this going to spiral out of control?

571
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,120
Master! Madam!

572
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,160
Have you heard about it?

573
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,240
What is it?

574
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,280
I was just at the hotel.

575
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,880
The staff said
they're planning to storm Rak's office

576
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,240
and take him hostage!

577
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,240
No,

578
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,840
my poor young master.

579
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,040
What if they get in?

580
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,400
Will Rak be harmed?

581
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,760
So does he have to be hurt

582
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,240
before you'll swallow your pride?

583
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,640
Where's Mr. Rak?

584
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,720
I… I don't know!

585
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,120
Search the room.

586
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,040
Hey.

587
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,520
Chen's here. He wants to negotiate.

588
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,040
Let's go hear him out.

589
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,560
I stand before you today
as a representative of Master Jiw.

590
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,680
The policies that caused so much distress
and dissatisfaction among all of you

591
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,640
stemmed from the mismanagement

592
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,600
of Mr. Rak and Mr. Ronnakorn.

593
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,600
Many of these decisions
were made without Master Jiw's knowledge,

594
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,480
as he had already stepped back.

595
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,760
But once he learned of your suffering,

596
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,720
he couldn't ignore it.

597
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,240
So he asked me,
someone who has worked with

598
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,640
and is well-acquainted with many of you,

599
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,800
to mediate.

600
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,240
What I'm going to say is that

601
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,680
all regulations implemented
under Mr. Rak's management

602
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,440
are now null and void.

603
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,040
Yeah!

604
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,240
Chen's negotiating for us now.
We don’t need to run anymore.

605
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,120
And what if the negotiation fails?
They'll come back and hurt us again.

606
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,640
Mr. Rak,

607
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,960
we can't exit
through the back door of the hotel.

608
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,560
-Why not?
-The staff are guarding all the exits.

609
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,320
Let's just go back to the office.

610
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,760
I really don't think they'll hurt us.

611
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,560
They just want to talk.

612
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,400
-Then how else can I get out?
-You'll have to climb the fence.

613
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,600
-Then take me there.
-This way, please.

614
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,560
-Wait! You're really not going back?
-Let's go.

615
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,040
-Climb over me, sir.
-All right.

616
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,040
I hope no one holds a grudge
against Mr. Rak or Mr. Ronnakorn.

617
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,080
They meant well and did it
for the good of the hotel.

618
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,280
But they're still young
and lack experience,

619
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,560
which led to many hasty decisions.

620
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,560
I sincerely apologize on their behalf.

621
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,040
So,

622
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,120
is Mr. Rak still our manager?

623
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,640
No! We don't want him!

624
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,000
Get out!

625
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,120
Dad.

626
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,760
Thank you, Son.

627
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,960
To reassure all of you,

628
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,000
I hereby appoint Chen

629
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,240
as Acting Hotel Manager

630
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,600
of our hotel,

631
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,960
effective immediately.

632
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,320
Yeah!

633
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,960
That's good.

634
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,600
That's good.

635
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,240
Great!

636
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,000
Why didn't you consult your father first
before doing something?

637
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,440
Were you trying to be smart?
And look how that turned out!

638
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,560
Well,

639
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,920
I just wanted to make a splash
to surprise Dad and you.

640
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,760
But what we did was the right thing, Mom.

641
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,960
We reassigned staff to departments
that matched their skills.

642
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,400
We cut unnecessary positions

643
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,800
and removed all those
hired through nepotism.

644
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,760
Yes. We saved
a ton on operating costs, Mom.

645
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
I get it.

646
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,440
But if you push too hard,
people will push back.

647
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,080
Will Mr. Chen really negotiate
for them, Madam?

648
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,520
He'd better.

649
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,400
I bet this was all part of Chen's plan.

650
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,040
He waited for Rak to mess up
just so he could crush him.

651
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,080
-Good day, sir.
-Chen.

652
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,440
<i>Welcome back to Charoenrung Hotel.</i>

653
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,320
<i>Wrap things up quickly.</i>

654
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,640
The real manager of Charoenrung Hotel
is coming back to take the reins.

655
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,480
He won't return
unless we let him marry Ranee.

656
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,240
<i>I'll stop sending him money.</i>

657
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,680
<i>Let's see how long he lasts.</i>

658
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,960
<i>That guy looks so familiar.</i>

659
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,480
I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

660
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,000
Your son's wedding is going to be
the talk of the town for sure.

661
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,400
