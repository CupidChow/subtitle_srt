1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,440
You love Dream, right?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,980
But I'm a man.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,040
Think carefully before giving me an answer.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,660
You seem happier since Day came back.

Nathadej Pititranun

11
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,360
I don't want to bother you to help me every day.

12
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,480
It's ok, I won't be here next month anyway.

13
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,860
Your face is oily.

14
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,600
People would think I let you do hard work.

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,560
How's it?

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,320
Is it ok?

17
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,160
Take it easy.

18
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,760
The more you force yourself, the lesser the progress.

19
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,500
Do you want me to help where you're struggling?

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,500
No need.

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,760
If you can't do it, just seek help from others.

22
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,380
Why do you have to be angry at me?

23
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,200
I can handle it myself.

24
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,820
Night.

25
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,400
Are you crazy?

26
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,240
You'll swim when you're stressed, won't you?

27
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,940
I don't want to.

28
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,060
I will miss him.

29
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,360
What are you going to do?

30
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,380
Dream is your happiness.

31
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,520
You will let your happiness disappear?

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,360
Night.

33
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,140
I didn't force you to confess to him.

34
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,100
Just think about what you should do.

35
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Listen to your heart.

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,880
Don't think too much.

37
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,940
Dream might not want to know my feeling anymore.

38
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,520
Day doesn't afraid to like Dream.

39
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,120
What are you afraid of?

40
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,720
The person you think might not accept you is also Day's father.

41
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,840
But Day is good at everything.

42
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,260
It's ok if he disappoints dad once.

43
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,060
But me?

44
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I've never made him proud.

45
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,880
And he has to disappoint in me because of this too?

46
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,100
I don't know what I should do.

47
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,700
I think this box might help you.

48
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,480
Not mom's birthday?

49
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,520
Dream's birthday.

50
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,500
Won't you help me?

51
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Put it to me.

52
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
Help me.

53
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,080
Here you are.

54
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,580
Well, this is my beloved brother.

55
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,340
Are you still here?

56
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
Yes.

57
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,840
If I had left, I wouldn't have known what you and Dream were doing.

58
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
What did we do?

59
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,020
The reason you start a fight with me is that you're jealous?

60
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,000
Jealous?

61
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,160
If not, why do you start a fight with me?

62
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm jealous or not, it's not your business.

63
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,560
What I did with Dream is also not your business.

64
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,740
The reason you can't write a novel is not that you don't know what love is.

65
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,740
It's because you're not studying hard.

66
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,060
You're a coward.

67
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,820
You've never succeeded in anything.

68
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,600
Don't teach me!

69
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,200
I have to because you're my brother.

70
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,240
I don't afraid of anything.

71
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,480
I won't give up on Dream because of you.

72
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,460
Me neither.

73
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:17,020
[A long time has passed since our stories from the old days]

74
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,300
[Until I've nearly forgotten that we once shared a journey]

75
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,960
[I still keep the good stories in my memory]

76
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,440
[There was you and I looking at the moon at night]

77
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:46,060
[The moon was our symbol, shining and sparkling on the nights there were no stars]

78
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,680
[Its light shined down on our hearts]

79
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,680
[If you miss me, look at it, the same sphere of the vast moon]

80
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,280
[Deep down, there’s still us, our connection is in there]

81
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,820
Soon, I have to close this cafe.

82
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
Come on.

83
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,080
You can re-open whenever you want.

84
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,400
Get it?

85
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,120
Don't worry.

86
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,340
Hello.

87
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,740
Well, about what we discussed earlier.

88
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,300
I won't continue the lease agreement.

89
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,860
Thank you.

90
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you think it's good to run away like this?

91
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,360
If I were Night, I would be shocked.

92
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,700
He called me 10 times already.

93
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm tired.

94
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,560
At first, I thought I could be friends with him.

95
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,900
But when I see him

96
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,820
I...

97
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,040
I can't.

98
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,220
Do you think you can run away forever?

99
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,640
I don't know.

100
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,560
You know where Dream is, right?

101
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,820
It's not your business.

102
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,640
It's my business.

103
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,120
If you hadn't interrupted me, I would have told him.

104
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,280
Told him?

105
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,540
Told him what?

106
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,020
I love him.

107
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,480
I want to be with him.

108
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,720
Why it's always you who makes my life harder?

109
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,920
Nothing is hard if you follow your heart.

110
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,580
Is it that hard?

111
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,260
I'm not you!

112
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,420
who always follow your heart.

113
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,400
I want to be with him

114
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,000
but I can't.

115
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,440
Who are you want to be with?

116
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,400
Dream.

117
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,560
I want to be with Dream.

118
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,460
But...you're a man.

119
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,680
That's why I can't.

120
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,360
I know you'll mad at me.

121
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,260
So, I won't be with him.

122
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,940
I try to be good.

123
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,600
I want you to see me as a good son.

124
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,780
But you!

125
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,400
Night.

126
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,400
- Calm down.
- You don't get anything!

127
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,400
Now,

128
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,200
He left me,

129
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,620
just like mom did.

130
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,300
I do want to work with you

131
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,460
but I'm stupid!

132
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,700
I can't study engineering for you.

133
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,680
So, I study literature.

134
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,100
I study what I like.

135
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,540
I hope you'll be proud.

136
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,460
What should I do?

137
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,080
Huh, dad?

138
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Tell me.

139
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,360
Say it.

140
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,180
Scold me.

141
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,560
Scold me like you used to do.

142
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,240
Do it.

143
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,980
Could you please understand me?

144
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,260
Night, wait!

145
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,580
Night!

146
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,280
Go to your room.

147
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,460
I need time to be alone.

148
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,540
Night.

149
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,000
The milk is here.

150
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,500
Night.

151
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,360
I know you can hear me.

152
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,560
Night!

153
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,600
You haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

154
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,220
Doing this isn't help you.

155
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,840
Let's talk it out.

156
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,380
I'll drop out of college.

157
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,800
I'll work with you.

158
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,840
Here you are.

159
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,180
Day said you'll drop out.

160
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,160
Is it true?

161
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,660
Did you think it through?

162
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,320
You have to pass only the thesis to graduate.

163
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,760
And I can't pass.

164
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,220
Whatever.

165
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,580
I don't want to think about it.

166
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,020
Is Dream affect your decision?

167
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920
Let me ask you honestly.

168
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,400
If you see him again, will you confess to him?

169
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,540
He might not want to hear.

170
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,860
How do you know?

171
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,040
He always hides from me.

172
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,040
How can I tell him?

173
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,280
If you want, I have a way.

174
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,720
But do you dare to do it?

175
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,240
I'm waiting for someone.

176
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,340
I'll speak when he's in.

177
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,640
I'll say what I should have said

178
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,780
but I didn't.

179
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,460
Dream.

180
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,740
Are you watching me, right?

181
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,380
I'm sorry for hurting you.

182
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,940
I have an answer for your question.

183
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,160
I want to be your boyfriend.

184
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,760
Dream.

185
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,040
I want to be with you.

186
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,260
Can you give me a chance?

187
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,720
Come back to me.

188
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,360
Hello, Zone?

189
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
I've just arrived.

190
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,360
Where are you?

191
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,440
I can't go, I have an urgent matter.

192
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,900
Sorry.

193
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,560
What?

194
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,840
Why did you ask me to be here then?

195
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,440
Dream.

196
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,300
Have you seen my live?

197
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,980
I can say it again if you want.

198
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,420
I don't want to be friends with you.

199
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,020
I want to be your boyfriend.

200
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
I want to be with you.

201
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,640
How about you?

202
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
What am I to you?

203
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,600
Night.

204
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,980
You want to be with me because you love me or you want to beat Day to it?

205
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,480
I might be the only thing you can outdo him

206
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,640
because you're too sure that I love you.

207
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,420
Right?

208
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,120
You're still the same, Night.

209
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,240
Dream.

210
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,420
About Dream, I'm sorry.

211
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,740
I'm being honest.

212
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,580
I love him as a brother.

213
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,840
That's why I want you to face the truth.

214
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,960
It's too late.

215
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,700
He might not want to see me anymore.

216
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,300
I didn't think it'll turn out like this.

217
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,720
He left me.

218
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,820
It hurts.

219
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,160
Damn it.

220
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,960
Why can't I succeed in anything?

221
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,960
You can, Night.

222
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,060
Just take it more seriously.

223
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,760
I'm afraid I'll lose.

224
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm afraid dad won't love me.

225
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm afraid it won't turn out well.

226
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,700
From now on, you don't have to be afraid.

227
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,740
If you have a problem, just tell me.

228
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,540
We'll sort it out.

229
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,120
Ok?

230
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,860
Am I a loser?

231
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,360
Night.

232
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,780
You're not a loser.

233
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,320
If you put your heart into it, it'll turn out well.

234
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,980
I'll help you.

235
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,040
- You came?
- Of course.

236
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,560
Congratulations.

237
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,840
Thank you.

238
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,460
Let's take a picture.

239
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,040
Ok.

240
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,620
You look handsome, today.

241
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,840
- Really?
- Yes.

242
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,880
You hair falls.

243
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,420
But you're still handsome.

244
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,020
Dream.

245
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
Will you be my boyfriend?

246
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,700
Day.

247
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm not ready.

248
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,060
It's fine.

249
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,400
I'll ask you again when you're ready.

250
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,000
Ok?

251
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,040
Can I ask you again?

252
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:17,040
The person in your heart is Night, right?

253
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,480
Happy birthday, Night.

254
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
I hope you're happy.

255
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,240
I hope you can be a writer as you wish to be.

256
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,660
Hope you like this necklace.

257
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,720
If not, you can't throw it away.

258
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,620
I'll be, Dream.

259
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,000
Sai-nam realizes when it's too late.

260
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,220
He crashed the heart of a person whom he loves the most.

261
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,120
An uncertain love is a certain pain.

262
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:28,140
He has no chance to make it right anymore.

263
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,980
I think you understand love by now.

264
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,720
Congratulations, you pass.

265
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,440
Thank you.

266
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,780
Night Dream
by Nawin Tanwanich

267
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,220
I miss Dream.

268
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,000
I miss him.

269
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,440
Dream turns off his phone.

270
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,980
I can't call him.

271
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,600
Where did he go? He didn't tell us.

272
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,140
Will we see him again?

273
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,400
I believe we'll see him one day.

274
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,300
Your room number is 108, please sign here.

275
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,800
Thank you so much.

276
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,200
This way, please.

277
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,180
Welcome, please have a seat.

278
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,160
Yes.

279
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,300
What would you like to order?

280
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,660
I'd like a mini pancake roll with corn custard and an iced latte.

281
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,660
That's it.

282
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,700
Wait a minute.

283
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,260
Thank you.

284
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,300
"We'll meet again someday"

285
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,140
Americano as usual, right? Boss.

286
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,880
I said don't call be boss.

287
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,620
It's weird.

288
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,480
Noted.

289
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,240
Am I dreaming?

290
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,540
It's you.

291
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:11,060
I've been thinking about the first thing I want to say to you when I meet you.

292
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,600
I love you, Dream.

293
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,740
Are you sure?

294
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,720
Yes, I am.

295
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,780
I'm sure.

296
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,900
I don't want to outdo anyone.

297
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,340
Just you and me.

298
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,200
You don't have to believe me.

299
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,080
If you don't run away from me,

300
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,980
I'll tell you 'I love you' every day until you're sure.

301
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,580
If you want me to be here,

302
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,580
what's the title you'll give me?

303
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,900
My boyfriend.

304
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,820
Will you be my boyfriend?

305
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,480
Thank you for giving me a chance.

306
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,080
Let me go, don't you shy?

307
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,600
Why I have to be shy? It's love.

308
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,640
By the way,

309
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,680
I have something for you.

310
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,660
Congratulations.

311
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,820
Finally, you followed your dream.

312
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,800
Wait!

313
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,120
Necklace?

314
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,940
Thank you for the birthday present.

315
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,280
It's yours.

316
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,940
I saw it at the back of the cafe.

317
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,820
I'm not sure if you still want to wear it.

318
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,520
Don't cry.

319
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,880
Sign a book for me.

320
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,420
Are you crazy? A writer asks for the autograph of a reader.

321
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,560
You're not just a reader.

322
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,660
You're part of the book.

323
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:05,100
Without you, I wouldn't have made it.

324
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,000
Alright, I'll sign for you.

325
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:41,880
I love you

326
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,020
I love you, Night
Dream

327
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,900
Why are you blushing?

328
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,140
Stop it.

329
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,760
I love you too.
