1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,940
Me and Namwan are not a couple.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,320
You're not a couple?

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,840
Listen to this.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,660
The way I see you with Namnam

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,860
is that you two sit together,

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,960
feed each other, hold hands,

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,480
take care each other,

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,860
and come to my cafe together.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,940
How come you aren't couple?

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,980
Why are you so stubborn?

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,140
She just wants it to be clear.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,500
I just can't.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,360
Why?

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,300
Thanakrit Chiamchunya

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,460
Krittawat Suwanich

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,920
Thanchanok Sanguansitthikul

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,460
Wongrapee Krusong
Thammasiri Umpujh

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,300
Napatsakorn Pingmuang

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,260
Nathadej Pititranun

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,840
5 years ago

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,640
What's wrong?

22
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,460
Don't you surprised?

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,580
Surprised what?

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,460
Are you ok?

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,460
You can write an essay to pass the test.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
Don't worry.

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,540
You even taught me.

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,060
Why did I fail?

29
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,280
The exam is always like this.

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't be stressed.

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
Let's write an essay.

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,560
I'll help.

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
Thank you.

34
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,400
If I hadn't had you, it would have gotten worse.

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
It's ok.

36
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
Let bygones be bygones.

37
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,200
Don't be stressed.

38
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,220
You should have let me repeat a year.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,860
I wouldn't let that happen.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,060
If you had to repeat a year, I would be lonely.

41
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,180
Let's write an essay.

42
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,640
Ok.

43
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
I miss you, Dream.

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,160
Where have you been?

45
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,580
Night.

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,080
You're drunk.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,200
You should sleep.

48
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,760
You've grown up a lot.

49
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,140
You're even cuter.

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,720
You're drunk, Night.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,620
Don't do this.

52
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,620
Please.

53
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,220
Then,

54
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,060
can I do this?

55
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,840
I'll ask him tomorrow.

56
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,580
Are you sure?

57
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,780
What if he's still uncertain?

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,200
I need to face the truth.

59
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,720
What else can I do?

60
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,940
Being in this unclear situation,

61
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,860
it's quite hurt.

62
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,100
Then,

63
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,100
are we still friends?

64
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Yes.

65
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,960
We've been friends for many years.

66
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,480
Even though you're away, I still see you as my best friend.

67
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,840
For Night,

68
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,900
I still love him.

69
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,060
I won't hate him,

70
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,900
I guess.

71
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,700
How are stars at the beach?

72
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,280
Are they beautiful?

73
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,160
Yes, they are.

74
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,240
See?

75
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,060
I told you to wail til the sky get dark.

76
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,920
You'll see the stars clearer and

77
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,080
more beautiful.

78
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,080
That's true.

79
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,980
Have you ever stargazed before?

80
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,780
No.

81
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,100
Your name is Night though.

82
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,460
So what?

83
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,940
You should try this.

84
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,240
You'll see the stars clearer.

85
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
It's the same.

86
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,920
What? You should use both hands.

87
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,860
How's it?

88
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,900
Are they beautiful?

89
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,100
Yes, they are.

90
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
Are you awake?

91
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,620
No.

92
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,260
Then, are you sleep talking?

93
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,420
You're wasted last night.

94
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,960
Did you know?

95
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
What did I do?

96
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,960
Nothing.

97
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,620
It's better that you can't remember.

98
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,060
Aren't you gonna wash your face and brush your teeth?

99
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,120
Can I join?

100
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,480
Let''s walk along the beach

101
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,540
Let''s walk along the beach
I have something to talk to you

102
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,320
What's wrong?

103
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,060
I'll walk along the beach with Namwan.

104
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,980
You can have breakfast with Zone first.

105
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,700
Night.

106
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,240
What are we?

107
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,480
Do you certain with your feelings?

108
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,440
Please tell me what you feel.

109
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,440
We're old enough to be honest with this.

110
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,620
I'm sorry.

111
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,280
I'm so wasted last night.

112
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,620
Why? Did you drink a lot?

113
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

114
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,660
Did you?

115
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,800
Yes.

116
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,760
Did you sleep well?

117
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,320
Yes.

118
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,100
Do you forget anything?

119
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,100
- No
- You guys don't forget anything, right?

120
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
- Yes
- Are you sure?

121
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,440
Of course.

122
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,920
I'll go check out.

123
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
Let's go.

124
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,280
You forget something?

125
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,360
- No.
- Ok.

126
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,440
Where is Namwan?

127
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
Is she still in there?

128
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,200
She's already left.

129
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,820
Left?!

130
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,360
And you let her?

131
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,080
Umm.

132
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,040
I already talked to her.

133
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,520
You're so cruel, Night.

134
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,520
Wan!

135
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,840
Are you ok?

136
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
I'm fine.

137
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm ok.

138
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,600
Actually, being unclear is an answer.

139
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,300
I just thought I could win his heart.

140
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,360
I care about you.

141
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,380
Thank you.

142
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,960
But I need time to be alone.

143
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,040
I'm sorry.

144
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,600
I get that.

145
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,820
We're supposed to be friends.

146
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,240
I've been acting unclear.

147
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm sorry.

148
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,540
Don't be.

149
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,340
Feelings can't be forced.

150
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,900
Night.

151
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,840
Could you do me a favor?

152
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,380
Sure.

153
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,340
If one day you feel certain with someone,

154
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,360
please tell me.

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,340
It's nothing.

156
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,540
I just want to know

157
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,700
what your love looks like.

158
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,980
See you.

159
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,760
About the thesis,

160
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,620
if you don't pass,

161
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,380
you have to retake this course next semester.

162
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,420
Don't think that you can just write me anything to pass.

163
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,380
I still give you a chance.

164
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,780
Please fix this problem.

165
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,500
Do you get it?

166
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,420
Yes.

167
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Literature?

168
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,160
Why do you choose literature?

169
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,300
What will you do after graduate?

170
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,060
I'm gonna write a novel.

171
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,860
I'm gonna work in a publishing industry.

172
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,640
Your family has a machine shop.

173
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:52,160
People like you can't work with others except run a family business.

174
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,440
You can't make a living by yourself.

175
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,940
I'm gonna graduate

176
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,080
and make a living by myself.

177
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,920
You can't even graduate.

178
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,200
You chose it yourself.

179
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,900
If you can't graduate,

180
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,420
then quit and come work with me.

181
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,640
But I don't want to.

182
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Why didn't you study hard then?

183
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,600
If you were good like half of your brother,

184
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,300
it would have been better.

185
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I'm not him.

186
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,040
You're useless.

187
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,680
Night.

188
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,380
Night.

189
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,240
You look horrible.

190
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,620
I'm useless like what they said.

191
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,880
Calm down.

192
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,580
About Namwan, I think you're just stressed

193
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,300
that's why you said that to her.

194
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,080
Are you free?

195
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,080
Umm.

196
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,800
Then,

197
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,200
come with me.

198
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,540
Where are we going?

199
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,620
You took me to a swimming pool to relief my stress?

200
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,480
Do you feel better?

201
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,060
See?

202
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,820
Doing things that we like

203
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,580
or exercise when we're stressed, we'll feel better.

204
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,080
Right?

205
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,520
Umm.

206
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
I feel much better.

207
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,500
You're always like this.

208
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,220
When you're sick, my dad scolds me for not taking care of you.

209
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,380
I'm confused who is actually his son.

210
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
You have to take good care of me.

211
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,620
So your dad won't scold you.

212
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,180
Put your hand away.

213
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,280
Is it hurt?

214
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,940
Little bit.

215
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,320
It's like I'm giving puppy a bath.

216
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,120
Why are you smiling?

217
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,940
Let's go.

218
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,380
You must be tired already.

219
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,660
Where are we going?

220
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,520
Hey, help me flip the pork.

221
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,860
It's burning.

222
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,300
I'm flipping it.

223
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,760
How can Moo Krata help?

224
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,560
Listen to this.

225
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,160
Can you hear it?

226
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,760
The sizzling sound.

227
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,060
It's cheering you up.

228
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,040
Don't give me a fake laugh.

229
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,520
I know that my joke is lame.

230
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,320
I just want you to be happy while eating yummy food.

231
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,480
Thank you.

232
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,620
It's just Moo Krata.

233
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,960
Nothing special.

234
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,500
Please don't disappear from me again.

235
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,600
You should eat a lot.

236
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,800
I won't disappear.

237
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,340
By the way,

238
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,420
when I'm eating Moo Krata I like to think about one song.

239
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,840
Do you know what song is it?

240
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,880
It's...

241
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,020
♪ Let’s be happy together, why be sad? ♪

242
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,100
What am I saying?

243
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,500
I'm impressed in how cheer me up.

244
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,720
I know.

245
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,860
Hey, what are you looking at?

246
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,520
You seemed horrible yesterday.

247
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,820
What makes you smile?

248
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,020
Did you make up with Namwan?

249
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,560
About Namwan, let it end like that.

250
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,220
Or you know how to fix the thesis?

251
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,480
Then...

252
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,280
are you in love?

253
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Really?

254
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,460
What?

255
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
No.

256
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,320
I'm just

257
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,460
thinking about something.

258
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,120
Ok.

259
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,500
Where will you go after class?

260
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,620
Don't tell me you're going to that cafe again.

261
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,520
You're so diligent.

262
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,520
The cafe is so far.

263
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,760
Actually, it's not far.

264
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,780
Plus, the cafe is busy

265
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,780
so I'm gonna help him.

266
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,780
I'm going.

267
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,360
Are you going now?

268
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,540
Umm. Why?

269
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,600
Ah, ok.

270
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,220
I'm leaving.

271
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,120
Hurry up.

272
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,880
Umm.

273
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,880
- See you.
- See you.

274
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,660
Why is he in a rush?

275
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,980
Here is your food.

276
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,240
Would you like to order more?

277
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,540
Green tea, right? What about you?

278
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,320
Orange cake, right?

279
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,500
We have more food menu.

280
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,860
Do you want to order?

281
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,260
Koon.

282
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,080
Wait a second.

283
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Namwan.

284
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,800
You're still gorgeous as always.

285
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
You too.

286
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,640
Thank you.

287
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,480
Would you like to order? I'll give you the menu.

288
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,500
It's ok.

289
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,420
It's on the house.

290
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,000
Hold on, I'll give you the menu.

291
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,840
Koon.

292
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,120
Night's in the kitchen, right?

293
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,900
Please bring him to talk to me.

294
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,220
If you like someone, will you tell them?

295
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,240
I don't know.

296
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,880
What a coincidence?

297
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,760
Have you guys still f*cked each other?
