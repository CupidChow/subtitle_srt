1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
The novel...

00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,960
"...excuse me, are you Sai?"

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,520
to Dr. Korporpong Kultheya

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,480
You said it's a romance novel

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,680
but I think it's fake.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,220
It's not real.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,380
I don't believe in what you wrote.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,860
I always say I know what love is.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,680
Actually, I don't.

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,820
Welcome.

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,020
This table, please.

19
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,460
Here is the menu.

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,360
What would you like to order?

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,300
Two cake, right?

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,020
1 Green tea.

23
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,980
Dream.

24
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,420
There's a few customers so then, we'll go to the college.

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,080
The professor wants to meet me.

26
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,500
I heard he's gonna get a special reward.

27
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,800
A pool villa stay

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,460
sponsored by our professor.

29
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,540
Of course, I deserve it.

30
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,920
You guys should prepare to pack your bag.

31
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,780
He's being flex.

32
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,960
It's true.

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,500
Are you done with these?

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,840
Almost.

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Hurry up.

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,940
I'll deliver them for you.

37
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,700
Thank you.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,720
Your welcome.

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,940
Let's go.

40
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,980
You grab them.

41
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,100
Why don't you help me?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,940
You'd better do it.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,200
See you.

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,860
5 years ago.

45
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,440
Ouch!

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,300
I'll get my usual, please.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,540
Hello.

48
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,880
Hello, Night.

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,780
Where are you going today?

50
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,940
I'll take Night to buy a swimsuit.

51
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,860
He can't wear his old one.

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,780
Of course he can't, Night gets taller.

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,880
Thank you.

54
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,140
May I take Dream to the mall?

55
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,380
You don't need to ask my permission, Dream already wants to go.

56
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,140
Why you say that, mom?

57
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,120
It's true.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,340
No, I want to stay here and help you.

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,580
Are you going now?

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,140
You said you gonna get some coffee, right?

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,300
You can go, I'll stay here with mom.

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,420
Yes, we're not in a rush.

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,820
Then stay here for a bit.

64
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,620
I need to get myself caffeine.

65
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,220
Please take care of this.

66
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,920
Ok, you'd better go.

67
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
What did he say?

68
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,500
Caffeine.

69
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,580
I couldn't catch that.

70
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,540
How did he know this word?

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,160
He learned it from me.

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
Smell so good.

73
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,860
When dad comes back, you guys can go.

74
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,860
Wanna try?

75
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,180
I'll have a mini pancake roll with coconut custard and

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,000
hot americano.

77
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,140
Just that.

78
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,160
Please wait a moment.

79
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,160
I think you should find your definition of love.

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,960
You have 3 months.

81
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,860
If you can't write a novel within 3 months,

82
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,280
you won't graduate.

83
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,100
Yes.

84
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
- hot americano 1
- mini pancake roll with coconut custard 1

85
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,260
Dream!

86
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,100
Night.

87
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,260
Do I have to say it again?

88
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,260
The exam is coming.

89
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,440
Same as you.

90
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,480
And you're reading a novel?

91
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,640
Dream.

92
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,060
Night is just relaxing.

93
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,740
Don't scold at him.

94
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,280
Yes.

95
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,020
Why you're on his side?

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,720
If you fail the exam,

97
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
I won't help you.

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,840
Alright, I'm about to finish.

99
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,880
How are you?
How are you?

100
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,180
Umm.

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm fine.

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,080
I thought you won't remember me.

103
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,260
You're still the same.

104
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,800
I..I miss you.

105
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,060
How long have we never seen each other?

106
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,460
Umm.

107
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,660
I think around 4-5 years.

108
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm happy to see you again.

109
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,100
How was my mini pancake roll?

110
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,820
Is it good?

111
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Yes, it's delicious.

112
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
As usual.

113
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,000
Night!

114
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,700
You should study.

115
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,620
The exam is next week.

116
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,060
How many times do I have to tell you?

117
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,240
Alright.

118
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,120
What is the definition of absolute value of real number?

119
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Err...

120
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,140
Night.

121
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,260
Do you study when you're at home?

122
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,240
Or you only read novel?

123
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,200
You know I hate math.

124
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
But you have to pass the exam.

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,360
If you fail, you have to re do.

126
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,480
That's a waste of time.

127
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,360
I know.

128
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,400
Then you have to teach me.

129
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
Alright.

130
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,700
Let's see.

131
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,820
The definition of absolute value of real number

132
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:27,640
is when X is a nummer, absolute value of X is X

133
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,260
and another one is

134
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,260
What are you doing?

135
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,940
Dream!

136
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,220
Can you teach me?

137
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,120
I fail math every year.

138
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,740
Can you teach me?

139
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm not that good.

140
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,440
But you get highest score every year.

141
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
She caught you.

142
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,560
Please help me, I don't want to fail again.

143
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,060
Alright.

144
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,100
Yay.

145
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,960
Bring a chair here.

146
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,560
Ok.

147
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,980
You have to teach, Night.

148
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,140
Me?

149
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,640
Yes, you can do it.

150
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,300
I saw you reading a novel.

151
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,800
He isn't study.

152
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,440
I've never thought I'll find you here.

153
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,440
I miss you so much.

154
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,840
Do you work here?

155
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,260
It's my cafe.

156
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,040
I run with my friends.

157
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,080
Me and Night miss you so much.

158
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,240
Right, Night?

159
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,200
Dream.

160
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,860
Can I ask you something?

161
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,240
What?

162
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,340
Why you didn't tell anyone when you moved?

163
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,760
What happened?

164
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,540
I'm tired.

165
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,220
I've been doing this all day.

166
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,220
Can we leave?

167
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,880
I still want to walk along the beach.

168
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,260
I'll be with him.

169
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,680
Then I'll leave.

170
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,500
I need to take a shower.

171
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,060
Bye.

172
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,000
Bye bye.

173
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
Girl, you leave early.

174
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,060
Let's go.

175
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,960
Go where?

176
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,180
Walking.

177
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,760
Don't you continue doing this?

178
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,140
I said I want to walk not pick up garbage.

179
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,200
Hey.

180
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,360
You know what, watching a star at a beach is one of my dreams.

181
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,440
Am I also in your dream?

182
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,080
My dream is just to watch a star at a beach.

183
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,460
I didn't think about that

184
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,880
but it's good to have you.

185
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,360
Do you have any other dreams?

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,580
Maybe I can help your dreams come true.

187
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,660
Actually, I have many dreams.

188
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,360
There's one dream that I want it to comes true the most.

189
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,920
Why you didn't tell anyone when you moved?

190
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,340
What happened?

191
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,940
I was busy

192
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,940
with my parents thing,

193
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,660
moved the house,

194
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,100
and school.

195
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,320
I was so busy.

196
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,420
Sorry for not contacting you.

197
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Can you promise us not to disappear again?

198
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,120
Umm.

199
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,320
Actually, I have many dreams.

200
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,060
There's one dream that I want it to comes true the most.

201
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,880
It is...

202
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,860
to stay with my loved one

203
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,420
and open a mini pancake roll cafe.

204
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,980
I'll make them a mini pancake roll every day.

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,000
I would be so happy.

206
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,140
You're gonna tricked them with food, aren't you?

207
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,860
Why did you say that?

208
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,900
This is how my dad got my mom.

209
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,720
My mom likes my dad's mini pancake roll,

210
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,360
so she stays with him.

211
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,820
Can you promise us not to disappear again?

212
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,120
Excuse me, I have to go.

213
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,460
This one is Thai pandan custard.

214
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,120
Ok.

215
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,440
Can I eat?

216
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,280
Ok.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,020
I...

218
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,860
I have a crush on Night.

219
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,240
Hey, are you lying here?

220
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,140
Umm.

221
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,000
Here are your drink, lady.

222
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,900
Thank you.

223
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,420
Do you want anything else?

224
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,900
You can go take care other customers.

225
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,400
You're so overreact.

226
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,060
These are my high school friends.

227
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,160
Night and Namwan.

228
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
Your friends?

229
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,240
Hello, I'm Koon.

230
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,020
This is Zone.

231
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,700
We're Dream's friends too.

232
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,080
Nice to meet you.

233
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,880
Nice to meet you too.

234
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm gonna make pancake, you can talk to each other.

235
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,500
Ok.

236
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,120
I'll talk to you guys.

237
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,860
Easy, Koon.

238
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,420
These are Dream's friends.

239
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,000
So what? Dream's friends are also my friends.

240
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,080
We're all friends, right?

241
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Umm, yes.

242
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,680
Then you entertain them, I'll go make some drinks.

243
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,040
Hold on! I'll have Red syrup lemon soda.

244
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,920
You must be thirsty because you talk a lot.

245
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,060
Here are your drinks.

246
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,960
How long have you known Dream? Since high school?

247
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,440
Yes.

248
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,500
Really?
Yes.

249
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
He taught me math, so we became friends.

250
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,060
Was he good at study?

251
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,320
I thought you already went back with Namwan.

252
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,240
Do you have anything to say?

253
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,920
Yes.

254
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,820
What is it?

255
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,960
Well...

256
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,880
can I come to your cafe more often?

257
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,380
Of course you can.

258
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,160
Why did you ask?

259
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,060
At first, you seemed uncomfortable.

260
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,720
I thought you didn't want to see me.

261
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,600
Happy birthday, Night.

262
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,020
I wish you can be a writer as you want.

263
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,360
I hope you like this necklace.

264
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,480
If you don't like it,

265
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,460
don't throw it away.

266
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,500
Yes, dad?

267
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,300
Dream, what are you doing?

268
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm making Night a gift.

269
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
I don't know if he'll like it.

270
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,800
I think Night likes everything you give him.

271
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,180
By the way, you'll go out with Night tomorrow, right?

272
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,700
Be careful.

273
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,500
Me and your mom will be back tomorrow.

274
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,560
Please take care of yourself.

275
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,840
Yes, dad.

276
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,500
Don't worry.

277
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,700
Love you.

278
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,140
Can I come to your cafe more often?

279
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,860
Of course you can.

280
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,300
Really?

281
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,720
You can come whenever you want.

282
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,720
I'll hold on to that.

283
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,940
I'll come here until you annoy me.

284
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,060
I'll hold on to that.

285
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,360
You should get back and take some rest.

286
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm about to close the cafe.

287
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,000
Ok, I'll go.

288
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,140
Hey.

289
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,140
Watch the way.

290
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,100
Bye.

291
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,960
Dream.

292
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,400
Are you alright?

293
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,740
You seem strange.

294
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,000
What are you talking about?

295
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,500
Is it about your old friends?

296
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
How did you know?

297
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,900
Umm.

298
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,420
Yeah.

299
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,600
But I'm not ready to talk about it.

300
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,600
Whenever you ready.

301
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,940
Ok?

302
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,600
Umm.

303
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,380
Hey, Dream.

304
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,380
About our cafe,

305
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,060
what are we gonna do?

306
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,320
Yeah.

307
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,660
I have to run my family's business.

308
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,060
Zone is already passed a job interview.

309
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,800
Or you will hire someone to help you?

310
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,540
To be honest, I still have no idea.

311
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,800
I got a job offer in Japan

312
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,240
but I still want to open a cafe.

313
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,660
You should think carefully.

314
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,180
Love has a variety of forms.

315
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,280
Love can't be determine.

316
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,700
Love has no rules.

317
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,940
If you still don't understand what love is,

318
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,280
you can't write this novel.

319
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,820
How can it be cliche?

320
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,020
Well...it's only meeting, flirting, and falling in love.

321
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,320
Something like that.

322
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,100
Maybe

323
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,240
the second male lead is so good

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,680
and has a chemistry with lead actress.

325
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,120
It seems like she likes him more than lead actor.

326
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,400
So, you change him to be a lead actor instead.

327
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,860
Wanna try this?

328
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,320
Really?

329
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,560
Lead actress should end up with lead actor.

330
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
This is a correct thing.

331
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,920
Think of it like this.

332
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,840
No matter how hard you try, if you aren't the one, you'll never be the one.

333
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,960
Right?

334
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,500
It's not always like that.

335
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,880
I think the audience can sense who should be ended up together.

336
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,940
They know lead actor more than he knows himself.

337
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,840
Hello?

338
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
Hello, Night. Wanna go to Dream's cafe?

339
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,360
I want to go again.

340
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,820
I still miss him.

341
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,800
Yes, see you there.

342
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,160
Wanna eat something?

343
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,540
Nah, I have a job interview.

344
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,700
Really?

345
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,840
Good luck.

346
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,580
I hope you pass it.

347
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,480
Thank you.

348
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,560
See you.

349
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,200
Today is a bit crowded.

350
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,260
Busy, right?

351
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,820
Umm.

352
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,360
You can leave an order for me.

353
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,280
I need to make a previous one first.

354
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,800
Umm.

355
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,260
Go do what you need to.
You can sit here.

356
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
Hey, Dream, there are 3-4 orders in the kitchen.

357
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,300
I deliver some orders and go to college with Zone.

358
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,140
Are you alright?

359
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,900
See you.

360
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,440
Hey, Namwan!

361
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,000
See you.
Gotta go.

362
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll be right back.

363
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
I'll be right back.

364
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,320
I have no one left.

365
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,480
I think I like you.

366
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,760
What do you think of me?

367
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,740
Can you promise us not to disappear again?

368
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,780
I feel guilty.
