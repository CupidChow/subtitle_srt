1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,240
You're so cruel, Night.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,280
Thanakrit Chiamchunya

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,500
Krittawat Suwanich

4
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,440
Thanchanok Sanguansitthikul

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,040
Wongrapee Krusong
Thammasiri Umpujh

6
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,080
Napatsakorn Pingmuang

7
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,280
Nathadej Pititranun

8
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,620
Night.

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,840
You don't have to worry.

10
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,140
Between us, it's already in the past.

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,660
I've been thinking

12
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,140
it's comfortable to stay friends with you.

13
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,220
No expectations.

14
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,180
No forcing yourself to do unwanted things.

15
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,040
Look, Dream.

16
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,600
- I'm sor --
- Don't say sorry.

17
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,160
You've said it multiple times.

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,660
And I already accepted your apology.

19
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
Right now,

20
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,900
we're best friends.

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,360
Is that clear enough?

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Yes.

23
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,600
We can still be friends, right?

24
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,960
Umm.

25
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,420
Hey, Night.

26
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
You seem stressed.

27
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,460
You already talked to Namwan, didn't you?

28
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,500
It's not about Namwan.

29
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,860
It's about my thesis.

30
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,400
Professor doesn't approve it.

31
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,840
He said I don't understand about love

32
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,460
and character.

33
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,440
If you don't understand love, why don't you ask others?

34
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,540
Shall we launch a promotion "share your love story, get free drink and mini pancake roll"?

35
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,980
I don't want to bother you.

36
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
You don't have to waste your time for me.

37
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,800
Don't think like that.

38
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,680
You're my friends.

39
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,460
If I didn't help you, who would I help?

40
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,940
That's it.

41
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,760
You make a poster.

42
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,920
I'll post it in the cafe page.

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,720
Ok?

44
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,120
Ok.

45
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,800
Start now.

46
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,100
If you're struggle, I'll help.

47
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,360
I used to date a man 4 years older than me.

48
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,040
We broke up after he graduated because we didn't have time for each other.

49
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,680
I like a woman who's 20 years older than me.

50
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,180
At first, I wasn't brave enough to make a move.

51
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,120
But I really like her so, I made a move.

52
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,160
We're together for almost 10 years now.

53
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,240
Dating someone secretly because he's famous.

54
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't want him to lose his fame.

55
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,800
So, I keep it secret.

56
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,020
I was an intern and dated a man in the company.

57
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,280
He broke up with me when others found out about us.

58
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,800
Let's call it a day.

59
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm tired.

60
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Are you?

61
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,360
Umm.

62
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,100
Ok.

63
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,100
Thank you for today.

64
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll close the cafe.

65
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,780
Ok.

66
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,600
Er..we're about to close.

67
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,680
What would you like to order?

68
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,040
I...

69
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,800
Er...I want to share my love story.

70
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,500
But I don't want to share it on FB.

71
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,780
So, I came here.

72
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,240
You can tell us.

73
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,320
We won't share your story on FB and tell anyone.

74
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,800
You guys are so cute.

75
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,420
I'll start.

76
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,040
I like my best friend.

77
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,800
No.

78
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,440
I have a crush on my best friend for 3 years.

79
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,920
I feel so good when I'm around him.

80
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,000
He makes my heart warm.

81
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,280
It's good that you find a person who makes you feel like that.

82
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,940
What's the problem?

83
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,100
The problem is

84
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,300
we're best friends.

85
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm afraid I'll lose him.

86
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,940
I don't know what he thinks about me.

87
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,700
From your perspective, what do you think I should do?

88
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Dream.

89
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,680
If you like someone,

90
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,400
will you tell them?

91
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,040
Why do you ask?

92
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,020
I want to know.

93
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,020
In novel, if a man like a girl and about to tell her

94
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,360
but someone interrupt him, he'll lose his confidence to tell her.

95
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,580
So, I want to know what would you do.

96
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
It takes a long time, huh?

97
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,340
I don't know.

98
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,380
What about you?

99
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,080
Me?

100
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,480
I don't know, that's why I ask you.

101
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Whatever.

102
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,200
It's just a random question.

103
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,920
I think you have to decide carefully.

104
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,040
If you make a wrong decision,

105
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,640
there's a chance you'll lose him.

106
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,340
This is what I'm afraid of.

107
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,800
But if you don't tell him,

108
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,480
there's also a chance someone might like him too.

109
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:15,040
At the end, you'll lose him to others.

110
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,200
That's true.

111
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,220
I don't even give him a chance to choose me.

112
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,340
I've made a decision.

113
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm gonna tell him.

114
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,900
I'm about to graduate.

115
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,900
I have nothing to lose.

116
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,360
Except being hurt.

117
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Right?

118
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,940
Is it clear?

119
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,780
Little bit.

120
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,320
Where are you going?

121
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,180
I'll buy some stuffs.

122
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,300
I'll go with you.

123
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,480
Why? You don't have to.

124
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,480
Go do your work.

125
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,700
It's ok.

126
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,700
You helped me a lot, let me help you this time.

127
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,400
No.

128
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,860
Yes.

129
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,220
Alright.

130
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,820
Wear a helmet.

131
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,680
Ready?

132
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,120
Hold on.

133
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,660
I'll go.

134
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,900
Is it clear?

135
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,360
Umm, yes.

136
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,120
Dream, is there anything I can help?

137
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,340
You find an excuse to not do your work again.

138
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,320
Helping you is better than do my work.

139
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,580
Alright.

140
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,860
Help me.

141
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,860
Move back.

142
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,580
What are you doing?

143
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,960
Thinking how to let you help me.

144
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,020
- Hold on.
- let me do dishes?

145
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,160
I'll do it myself.

146
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,280
Ok.

147
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,140
Here.

148
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,300
Use this to stir custard.

149
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,800
Hurry up.

150
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,360
Yes, chef.

151
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,880
If you hadn't forgotten to close the order, we wouldn't have waited like this.

152
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,220
I know.

153
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,040
Don't scold me.

154
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,040
Mosquitoes are biting me.

155
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,420
Hello?

156
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm waiting at the front of the cafe.

157
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,060
Ok.

158
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,460
Here you are.

159
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,100
Damn.

160
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,300
What's up, Dream?

161
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,960
Wanna play basketball?

162
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,400
We need 1 more person.

163
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,300
He won't play.

164
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,140
He protects his skin.

165
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,740
He's gay, he has to care about his skin, right Dream?

166
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,080
Go play basketball.

167
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,620
Don't bother him.

168
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,960
Why?

169
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,160
Are you his boyfriend?

170
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,980
So what?

171
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,860
- Keep protecting him.
- Let's go, Night.

172
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,160
Don't talk to them.

173
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,440
They're talking sh*t.

174
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,060
- Night!
- Come on.

175
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,120
- Night.
- What the freak.

176
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,380
- Wanna fight?
- Night.

177
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
- I'm not afraid.
- Night, stop.

178
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,320
Enough.

179
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,660
They won't stop bully Dream because you're like this.

180
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,520
Damn.

181
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,900
I'll punch you!

182
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,460
I wanna fight not play basketball.

183
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,140
What a coincidence!

184
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,760
Have you guys still f*cked each other?

185
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,060
There's no way to cure a gay syndrome, I guess.

186
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,620
You've been gay since you were young.

187
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,120
Let me ask you something.

188
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,420
Are you stupid?

189
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,640
What year are we in?

190
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,720
Why someone still bully others?

191
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:53,860
Or you don't do anything except watching your feet that's why you know nothing.

192
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,760
I'll tell you what.

193
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,520
People don't care about gender now.

194
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,840
They care about brain.

195
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,960
Do you know what brain is?

196
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,860
I guess not.

197
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,280
Because you don't have it.

198
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,540
God damn, you got a mouth on you.

199
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,780
Does that bother your father?

200
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,260
Huh?

201
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,680
Damn you.

202
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,440
Dream.

203
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,780
For what?

205
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,560
I didn't protect you from them.

206
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,360
Umm.

207
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,760
I get it.

208
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,920
No, you don't.

209
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
I don't even understand myself.

210
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,520
Dream.

211
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,440
What?

212
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,680
We asked many people about their love story.

213
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,580
You haven't told me about yours.

214
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,420
There's nothing much.

215
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,260
You don't have to know.

216
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,240
Come on.

217
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,420
Tell me, I wanna know.

218
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,080
I just

219
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,620
have a crush on someone

220
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,520
who warms my heart

221
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,040
when I'm around him.

222
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,700
I want to see his smile.

223
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,200
I want him to be happy.

224
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Just that.

225
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,240
You must really like him.

226
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,260
Does he know you like him this much?

227
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,560
Maybe.

228
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,240
Or maybe not.

229
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,780
I must ask him if he likes me or not.

230
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,900
How are they?

231
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,200
Are they beautiful?

232
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,400
I think

233
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,220
he likes you too.

234
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,480
Dream.

235
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,480
Dream!

236
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,480
Are you alright?

237
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,260
Damn.

238
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,800
You've been zoning out since morning.

239
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,120
Can you tell customers to wait a second?

241
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,380
I'll tell them.

242
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,780
Are you ok?

243
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,580
What did professor say?

244
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,260
He said I still don't understand love.

245
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,360
Nut.

246
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,300
Hmm?

247
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,600
What is your definition of love?

248
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,120
That's a tough question.

249
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,240
My definition of love is

250
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:44,780
if I lose someone and that makes me hurt,

251
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,220
that means I love them.

252
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,640
Have you felt this way with anyone?

253
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,840
I have to go.

254
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,780
You guys will miss me a lot.

255
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,340
But don't worry, I'll visit you.

256
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,880
You're full of yourself.

257
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,920
Thank you for everything.

258
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,320
Never mind.

259
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,320
Take care of yourself.

260
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Don't keep things to yourself.

261
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,020
You can call me.

262
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
But first, reply my text!

263
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,600
- You don't reply my text.
- I know.

264
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
What?

265
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,220
I want to hug too.

266
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,220
Don't be lazy or else your mom will scold you.

267
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,780
And you don't cry because you miss me.

268
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,340
I don't have time for that.

269
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,000
When I start my job, I'll be so busy.

270
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
Busy boy?

271
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,080
- Of course, I have a job.
- Me too.

272
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,100
Enough.

273
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,860
Get home safe.

274
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,520
Let's hug.

275
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,980
- I've to go.
- Have a safe trip.

276
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,900
- See you.
- Bye bye.

277
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,020
Hello?

278
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
What's the matter?

279
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,380
I have something to talk to you.

280
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,380
Are you busy?

281
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,960
No.

282
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,420
About the lease agreement,

283
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,300
like I said your agreement lasts only for 2 years.

284
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,980
The term is about to end.

285
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,800
Do you want to continue the lease agreement?

286
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,600
If not, I'll let others make a deposit.

287
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,920
I'll call you back.

288
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,960
Are you hiding me because of that night?

289
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,480
I think the person I like

290
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,740
is you.

291
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,880
Wanna tell me something?

292
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,780
Let's start over.

293
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,180
We'll be friends

294
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,460
like you wanted us to be.
