1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,120
I must ask him if he likes me or not.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,900
What is your definition of love?

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,040
if I lose someone and that makes me hurt,

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,960
Thanakrit Chiamchunya

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,120
Krittawat Suwanich

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,440
Thanchanok Sanguansitthikul

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,080
Wongrapee Krusong
Thammasiri Umpujh

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,800
Napatsakorn Pingmuang

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,040
Nathadej Pititranun

10
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,040
Dream.

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,700
Night.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,200
Are you hiding me because of that night?

13
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.

15
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,500
Let me ask you honestly.

16
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,840
What are we?

17
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,480
Won't you say something?

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,960
I don't want to imagine things.

19
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,060
I get it.

20
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,540
If we can still be friends,

21
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm at the cafe.

22
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,320
I'm gonna tell him.

23
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,780
I'm about to graduate.

24
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,780
I have nothing to lose.

25
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,660
Except being hurt.

26
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,560
Right?

27
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,220
Dream.

28
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:16,980
Dream.

29
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,300
Hey!

30
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,200
Are you alright?

31
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,760
You look exhausted

32
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,460
Little bit.

33
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,180
It's good that you're here.

34
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Please help me clean up.

35
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,980
Alright, I'll do it.

36
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
Go take some rest.

37
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,460
Put this inside.

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Thank you.

39
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,700
You didn't ask me to listen to your sigh, right?

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,700
Stop messing with me.

41
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,380
Say something.

42
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,940
I've been thinking

43
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,740
I think the person I like

44
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,020
is you.

45
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,920
What makes you think that?

46
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,340
I'm happy when I'm near you.

47
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm happy when you smile.

48
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,780
I'm happy that you say what's on your mind.

49
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,400
But believe me, you don't like me like that.

50
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,960
If 2 people are standing in front of you right now,

51
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,540
the person who makes your heart trembling is not me.

52
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,420
It's Dream.

53
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,560
My feeling for you is real.

54
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,640
I didn't say it's a lie.

55
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,400
But it's a feeling for a friend

56
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,240
not a lover.

57
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,200
I can date you now.

58
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,720
But it means you're lying to yourself.

59
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,520
And I want to be friends with you.

60
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,420
I don't want to be in another person's shadow.

61
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,020
Night.

62
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,080
The more you lie to yourself, the more you make others hurt.

63
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
You love Dream, right?

64
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,460
But I'm a man.

65
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,380
How can it be?

66
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,620
I know that the world is open now.

67
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,680
But for someone,

68
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,320
they still can't accept this.

69
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
You mean your dad, right?

70
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,360
Night.

71
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,460
Listen to your heart.

72
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,020
If you care about others, how can you be happy?

73
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
I'll try.

74
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,660
Do you think Dream will wait for me?

75
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,400
Umm, I think he will.

76
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,680
Everything has its timing.

77
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,140
You and Dream too.

78
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,660
I don't want to imagine things.

79
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,280
Let me ask you honestly.

80
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,140
What are we?

81
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
If you can't take it, don't force it.

82
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,700
I told him.

83
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
I confessed to him.

84
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,340
He might not want to see me.

85
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,780
He might not want to be here.

86
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,880
Let him be.

87
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,420
If he won't come here, I will.

88
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,280
Stop thinking about him.

89
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,720
He's dumb for hurting you like this.

90
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,520
He's not dumb.

91
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,580
He just doesn't love me.

92
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,960
Poor you.

93
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,720
Still protecting him even though he rejected you.

94
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,680
I think I need to be alone.

95
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,100
You don't have to come.

96
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,260
Ok, I'm fine.

97
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,560
Day!

98
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,580
By the way,

99
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,160
Is there a mini pancake roll in Japan?

100
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,600
I looked for it around Tokyo but couldn't find it.

101
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,620
That's weird.

102
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,260
How can Japan don't have a mini pancake roll?

103
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,160
Will you stay here permanently?

104
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,860
I think so.

105
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,860
I need to work in a Thai branch.

106
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,580
A company that you once told me they were hiring?

107
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
Yes.

108
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,280
Wow, that's great.

109
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,260
You're so talented.

110
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,320
Do you have anything to tell me?

111
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,960
Are you ok?

112
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,280
Of course.

113
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,520
I'm fine.

114
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,080
Won't you go home?

115
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,900
I can be alone.

116
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,680
Just need to sleep.

117
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,900
It's late, I'll sleep here.

118
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,240
You said you need to get home.

119
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,220
I told my dad I'll be home in the morning.

120
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,480
Then, I'll sleep here.

121
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,160
Get up.

122
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,300
Go make a bed.

123
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,940
Do it for me, please.

124
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,380
- I can't.
- No, you can. Please.

125
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Do it yourself.

126
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,760
Night: Can I...still go to your cafe?
Dream: Um...yes.

127
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,960
Night: We...we're still friends, right?

128
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,400
Night: You and me.

129
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,160
Night: Can we be the same?

130
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:08,120
Dream: Yes.

131
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,480
Night: Thank you so much.

132
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,560
Dream.

133
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,420
I'm sorry.

134
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,640
I didn't mean to.

135
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,700
Damn, you meant to, Night.

136
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,000
Dream.

137
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,900
I'm sorry.

138
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
Let bygones be bygones.

139
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,360
Forget about it.

140
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,300
Forget?

141
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,100
I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.

142
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,300
Let's start over.

143
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,840
We'll be friends

144
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,940
like you wanted us to be.

145
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,660
- But I'm --
- Dream!

146
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,520
If there's anything you want me to help, you can tell me.

147
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Sure.

148
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,560
Night.

149
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,440
What did you say?

150
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,040
Nothing.

151
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,500
Do you know each other?

152
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,140
Dream and Night are friends.

153
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,560
Do you know Night?

154
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,120
Wait.

155
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,740
Day.

156
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,740
Night.

157
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Don't tell me.

158
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,960
Night is my brother.

159
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,560
Really?

160
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,320
That's why you guys look alike.

161
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,400
I know Night has an older brother.

162
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,160
But I didn't think it's you.

163
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,900
Why we haven't met each other before?

164
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,720
Night doesn't want me to know his personal life.

165
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,320
But I know one of his friends.

166
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,640
Namwan, I guess.

167
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,860
She used to visit our house.

168
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,540
Ah, Namwan.

169
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,820
Actually, she's our friend too.

170
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,700
What a coincidence!

171
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,100
Do you want to eat anything?

172
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,460
I'll make it.

173
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,020
No.

174
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,340
I've errands to run.

175
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,100
Please help me clean up.

176
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,840
Day, water.

177
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,840
Thank you.

178
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,780
Night doesn't want to be home.

179
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
He said he's uncomfortable.

180
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,100
I know that he doesn't like me.

181
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,520
Night barely talks since mom left.

182
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,340
He might think his dad doesn't understand him.

183
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,140
He studies in a faculty that his dad doesn't like.

184
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,460
He also said his dad loves only his brother

185
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,720
because his brother is so talented.

186
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,000
He knows that's not true.

187
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,220
Dad loves him so much.

188
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,580
He doesn't try to understand dad.

189
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,620
I think you need to talk to him.

190
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,100
He might listen to you.

191
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,560
I hope so too.

192
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,140
You know he's not open up.

193
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,920
Who let you in?

194
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
I want to get in.

195
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,800
Get out!

196
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
I don't have anything to talk to you.

197
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,060
Go talk to your dad.

198
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,400
He's in a factory.

199
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,100
He'll be here for dinner.

200
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,340
His beloved son is here, of course, he has to be here for dinner.

201
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,560
Where are you going?

202
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,340
I asked you.

203
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,700
I won't be here to disturb him.

204
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,600
Stay for dinner.

205
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,500
We haven't met for a long time.

206
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,020
Please.

207
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,740
Eat more.

208
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,840
I think you're slimmer.

209
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,140
Thank you.

210
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,880
Are you gonna start your work soon?

211
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,060
Yes.

212
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,580
My company has a Thai branch

213
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,460
so I'll work here.

214
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,020
Which position?

215
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,700
Manager.

216
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,040
Same as when I was in Japan.

217
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,600
That's good.

218
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,100
What about you?

219
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,040
Don't you be ashamed that you can't graduate?

220
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,720
If you can't graduate, just work with me.

221
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,600
How about that?

222
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm asking you.

223
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,100
Where are you going?

224
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,060
How was Japan?

225
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,780
Was it good?

226
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:53,760
Dream: Night, where are you?

227
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,680
Dream: Day worries about you.

228
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,440
About the lease agreement,

229
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,960
like I said your agreement lasts only for 2 years.

230
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,140
The term is about to end.

231
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,940
Do you want to continue the lease agreement?

232
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,720
If not, I'll let others make a deposit.

233
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,320
Dream.

234
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,200
What's wrong? You seem stressed.

235
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,500
I've been thinking about the cafe.

236
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,320
The cafe?

237
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,260
The owner asked me if I wanted to continue the lease agreement.

238
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,620
What's up?

239
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,700
Dream.

240
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,480
About the cafe,

241
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,980
Did Namwan tell you?

242
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,360
Why didn't you tell me you'll close the cafe?

243
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,300
Where will you open the new one?

244
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,560
Have you found a place?

245
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,460
Night, relax.

246
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,460
I haven't made a decision yet.

247
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,440
You have to tell me where you will go.

248
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,020
You made me a promise.

249
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,440
- You --
- Dream.

250
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,540
I bought you your favorite congee.

251
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,480
Hey, Night.

252
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,140
You're here?

253
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,620
Are you hungry.

254
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,980
I've bought so much congee.

255
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,280
Wanna eat?

256
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,820
Night, let's talk about the cafe later.

257
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,060
Let's eat together.

258
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,380
This is your congee with 2 eggs, no ginger.

259
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
Do you still remember?

260
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,280
How can I forget?

261
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,520
I remember everything about you.

262
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,980
About what we discussed, don't forget to give me answer.

263
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Of course.

264
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,200
But give me some time.

265
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,600
You'd better hurry.

266
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,060
Think carefully before giving me an answer.

267
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,500
Is this yours?

268
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,160
What's inside?

269
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,980
Minced pork and no ginger.

270
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,740
Minced pork and no ginger?

271
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,700
You seem happier since Day came back.

272
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,620
I've never made him proud.

273
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,040
And he has to disappoint in me because of this too?

274
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,640
I don't know what to do.

275
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,640
You've never succeeded in anything.

276
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,840
Don't teach me!
