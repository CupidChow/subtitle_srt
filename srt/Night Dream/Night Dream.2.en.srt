00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,460
Hello, aunty?

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,300
Hello, it's Dream, right?

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,800
Yes.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,000
Dream, your parents had a car accident.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,800
Car accident?

Nathadej Pititranun

13
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,220
I'm sorry, they're both passed away.

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,660
May I be excused?

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,220
Dream.

16
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,600
I have no one left.

17
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,140
I feel guilty for making them worried about me.

18
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
They just cared me.

19
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,400
Is anything wrong?

20
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,660
I saw that you're busy

21
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,120
so, I want to help.

22
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,300
If you want to help me, wash your hands first.

23
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,980
Do you still remember how to do it?

24
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,080
Of course.

25
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,000
Never forget.

26
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,780
I must be here a wrong day.

27
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,140
I was gonna talk to you.

28
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,600
Umm.

29
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,500
Sorry, today was so busy.

30
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,360
If you hadn't helped me,

31
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,360
I would have died.

32
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,320
Thank you.

33
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,760
How was today?

34
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
You skipped your work.

35
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm exhausted.

36
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,040
It's because of Zone.

37
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,280
He was slow.

38
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
I have something to tell you.

39
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,320
Next week, we have to close the cafe for 2 days

40
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,700
because we're going to the beach.

41
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Wow, you're going to travel!

42
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,960
Do you want to join?

43
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,000
Can I?

44
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,120
Of course, the villa is huge.

45
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,060
He's so lucky.

46
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,240
This pool villa is sponsored by his professor.

47
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,740
I can't believe it.

48
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,280
I told you, I'm his favorite.

49
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,720
I want to go.

50
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,820
Can you go with me?

51
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,220
Please.

52
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,980
You have no excuse, Dream.

53
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
This trip will be Koon's farewell.

54
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,520
If he graduates, he has to go back home.

55
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
Please go.

56
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,560
I want to.

57
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,000
Ok.

58
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,240
Yay.

59
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,980
We'll go with you.

60
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,960
The more people, the more fun.

61
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,340
I think...I like you.

62
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,100
What do you think of me?

63
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,900
Finally, we get to travel.

64
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,980
True.

65
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,880
I've waited for so long.

66
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,760
Hey, Dream, we'll go there first.

67
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,540
I'll check in and prepare for the food.

68
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,060
Are you ok going with Night and Namwan?

69
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,000
If you're not, we can wait for you.

70
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,260
You can go ahead.

71
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,580
It might take me noon to finish the orders.

72
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,820
Are you sure?

73
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,520
Are you ok with that?

74
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
Please put yourself first.

75
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,140
We can get late check in.

76
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,860
Yeah.

77
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
I'm ok.

78
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,400
They're also my friends.

79
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,800
Ok.

80
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,060
Why do the customers want the pancakes today?

81
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,020
You can't blame them.

82
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,780
They've ordered in advance.

83
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
Anyway, I need to make the orders now.

84
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
Alright.

85
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
Let's go
See you.

86
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,600
So beautiful.

87
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,280
The atmosphere is nice.

88
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,600
I love it.

89
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,720
I stayed up all night for my thesis

90
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,400
and got the highest score.

91
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,300
This is what I deserve after what I've been through.

92
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,440
If one day I build my own house, can you help design it?

93
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,080
Sure.

94
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm good too.

95
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,740
Good that I graduate.

96
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,880
You're good too, Koon.

97
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,460
You just didn't pay enough attention.

98
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,240
Why did I have to since I have you?

99
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
How do we share the room?

100
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,780
So, I can get my stuff in it.

101
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,040
We have 3 rooms.

102
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,060
Me and Zone will be in the first room.

103
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,780
Then you and Night.

104
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,360
Namwan gets the other room.

105
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,280
Is it ok with you?

106
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,420
You can be with Namwan.

107
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,980
It's ok.

108
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,880
I can sleep with you.

109
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,120
I can sleep alone.

110
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,020
If I can't, I'll go to your room.

111
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,960
Ok, let's put the stuff in and change to swimsuit.

112
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,320
Yes.

113
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,240
Let's go

114
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,660
Hurry up.

115
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,560
My bag is so heavy.

116
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Hurry up.

117
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,940
Dream.

118
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,620
Can you help me with something?

119
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,100
What is it?

120
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,980
About Night.

121
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,040
About Night? Why?

122
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,340
I'll be honest with you

123
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,300
I want to know what are me and him.

124
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,380
I think I like Night.

125
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,380
Really?

126
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,620
Be quiet.

127
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm happy for you.

128
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
You're the only person I told.

129
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,800
Don't tell him.

130
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,380
Umm.

131
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,880
Promise?

132
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,100
I promise.

133
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,340
You can tell me anything.

134
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,920
I was uncomfortable,

135
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,920
just wanted to tell someone.

136
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm afraid to tell him.

137
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,780
What do you think he will think of me?

138
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
I don't know.

139
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,360
Why don't you ask him?

140
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm afraid I'll lose a friend.

141
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,160
You might think we're couple, right?

142
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Actually,

143
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm not sure.

144
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,180
He's never said we're couple.

145
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,200
I want to know what we are.

146
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,080
Can you help me?

147
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,220
What do you want me to do?

148
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,760
Well

149
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,880
help me to set a romantic atmosphere with him.

150
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,680
Maybe we get used to being together.

151
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,040
If he's in a nice place, he might be in a good mood.

152
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
So, I can ask him about it.

153
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,460
Please help me.

154
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,720
Please.

155
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,200
Promise me that you'll help me.

156
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,280
Dream, Namwan, let's do a water fight.

157
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,280
The loser one have to drink the whole bottle.

158
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
Nah
Why?

159
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,500
I'll follow you later.

160
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,660
Ok, let's go, Dream.

161
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,600
Alright.

162
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
You're wet.

163
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,920
You take a shower first.

164
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,960
Up to you,

165
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,120
if you want to freeze to dead.

166
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,860
Umm.

167
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,340
What's wrong?

168
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,320
Act like you've never seen it.

169
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
I always take my shirt off when swimming.

170
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
It's been a long time.

171
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,880
I forget it.

172
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,880
Dream.

173
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,840
When you moved and didn't contact me,

174
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,300
were you really that busy?

175
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,580
We've been friends for 5 years.

176
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,900
Isn't that enough for you to think of me?

177
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,660
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,580
Never mind.

179
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,600
Next time, you have to tell me if you'll go somewhere.

180
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,380
Ok?

181
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,980
Go take a shower.

182
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,440
You're gonna get sick standing here wet.

183
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,460
I'm going.

184
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
help me to set a romantic atmosphere with him.

185
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,540
So, I can ask him about it.

186
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,440
Promise me that you'll help me.

187
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,160
Dream.

188
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,640
You're here because Namwan and Night can have a romantic moment?

189
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,800
Really?

190
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,260
Why didn't you tell me?

191
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm good at this.

192
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,880
If you had told me, I would have made them a very romantic night.

193
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,900
Don't tease him.

194
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,000
Look at him.

195
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,560
Standing here with a glum face.

196
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,700
Don't look at me like that.

197
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,380
We can tell.

198
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,000
What else I can do?

199
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,220
She asked me for help.

200
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,680
And they like each other,

201
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,520
Night is just not a romantic person.

202
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,720
I think he just plays dump.

203
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Namwan.

204
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,520
Wanna have dinner?

205
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,480
Look at my dress, is it pretty?

206
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,860
Well, you look extraordinary.

207
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,260
I've never seen you wearing this.

208
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
Do you like it?

209
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,800
I..it's pretty.

210
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,780
Where are the others?

211
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,840
I haven't seen them.

212
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,280
This place is nice.

213
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,760
Don't you think?

214
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,100
So romantic.

215
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,520
If I have a wedding, I want it to be at a beach.

216
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,980
What about you?

217
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,040
I don't know.

218
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,500
I've never imagined about my wedding.

219
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,160
Why is everyone not here?

220
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,320
I'll call Dream.

221
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,860
Why did you ask me to be here?

222
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,180
Well...I...

223
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,720
I think I like you.

224
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,120
What do you think of me?

225
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,820
I'm not sure.

226
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,180
Can you give me a chance?

227
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,820
We can try.

228
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,280
If one day you feel certain, you can tell me.

229
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,880
I'll wait.

230
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,880
Hey!

231
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,560
Hey, why are you so late?

232
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,700
I had a diarrhea.

233
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
Wow Namwan, you look stunning.

234
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,260
Thank you, Koon.

235
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,620
So cute.

236
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,760
If you dress like this every day, you must have so many guys flirt with you.

237
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm one of them.

238
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,780
What?

239
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
Let's eat.

240
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,580
I've waited for you till I'm starving.

241
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,020
Ok, let's eat.

242
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,120
This meal is on me.

243
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,000
If you're not full, I have more.

244
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,380
Especially Namwan, please eat a lot.

245
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,060
Enough.

246
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,020
I'm rich.

247
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,140
You can't eat too much.

248
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,620
Let's try Tom Yum.

249
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,860
You try this, it's shrimp.

250
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
You try it first.

251
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm already full.

252
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,080
I saw you eat so, I'm full.

253
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,280
Here you are.

254
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,540
So convenient for you.

255
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,460
Of course, I have you peel the shrimp for me.

256
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,320
What to eat next?

257
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,660
This one.

258
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,700
I'll be lazy next time.

259
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,620
I can't peel it.

260
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,800
What if I get a wound from peeling the shrimp?

261
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,100
Thank you.

262
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
I can do it myself.

263
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,480
Namwan would be upset that you did this.

264
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,980
You're a couple.

265
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,460
You should take care of her.

266
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Don't worry about me.

267
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,680
I've learned how to peel the shrimp.

268
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,840
Hey, Koon.

269
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,020
You have to drink bottom up.

270
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,480
Because you lose.

271
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,960
You too.

272
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,560
Hey, Night, it's me or yours?

273
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,500
If you're not ready, this one is mine.

274
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,700
It's yours then.

275
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Let me eat first.

276
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,200
Here you are.

277
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
Cheers!

278
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,620
Bottom up!

279
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,500
Bottom up?

280
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,620
Of course.

281
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,520
Night.

282
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,980
Night!

283
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,040
Aren't you gonna wash your face?

284
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,780
Me and Namwan are not a couple.

285
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,720
You're not a couple?

286
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,200
Listen to this.

287
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,820
The way I see you with Namnam

288
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,040
is that you two sit together,

289
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,120
feed each other, hold hands,

290
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,560
take care each other,

291
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,900
and come to my cafe together.

292
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,180
How come you aren't couple?

293
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,080
Why are you so stubborn?

294
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,260
She just wants it to be clear.

295
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
I just can't.

296
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,520
Why?

297
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,360
I miss you, Dream.

298
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,180
You've grown up a lot.

299
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,460
You're drunk.

300
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,380
Don't do this.

301
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,380
Please.

302
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,080
Then,

303
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,720
can I do this?

304
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,600
I want to know what your love looks like.

305
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,080
You're so cruel, Night.
