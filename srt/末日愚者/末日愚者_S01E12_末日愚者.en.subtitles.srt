00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:18,184
52 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION
JANUARY 1, 2026

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,057
No, that's not it.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,061
Why are you speeding up?
You have to follow my hands!

4
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,979
-You were too quick.
-Jang-beom, Dae-han!

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,856
I was looking at the lyrics.

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,401
-What is this?
-What? Mi-ryeong!

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,988
I heard this ragtag bunch was at it,
so I had to show support.

8
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,948
So what if we're a ragtag bunch?

9
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,867
You sounded good from outside.

10
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
Hear that?

11
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,037
We're not hearing from those who left.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,790
It was frustrating to stay at home,
so we came here.

13
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,666
And it's nice.

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,921
I heard singing is good for your lungs
and your brain too.

15
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,674
You and your wife should keep coming.
Use this chance to sing your heart out.

16
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,218
You bet we will!

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,598
Hey, you're good!

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,309
No need to applaud her.

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,061
Go on. Sorry, Sister.

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,063
Singing makes all your worries go away!

21
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,482
-Yeah.
-You all lack confidence.

22
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,900
-Right.
-Sing louder!

23
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,485
-Okay!
-Jang-beom, Dae-han.

24
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,070
-What?
-I saw you mouthing along.

25
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,738
-I wasn't!
-Put in some effort.

26
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,782
-I put effort into mouthing--
-Be serious.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,200
Ready, go.

28
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,577
Are we starting from the top again?

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,745
Oh, okay.

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,498
Here we go.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,090
I felt like coming back.

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,136
After three days with my family,
I was tired of them.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,515
Are you back for good?

34
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,724
For now.

35
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
But I quite liked traveling around.

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,188
Play a game of soccer before you go.

37
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,940
Sounds good.

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,459
Wait.

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,463
Do they know I'm coming?

40
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,675
-No.
-Wait…

41
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,726
Get the scarf off of me. Everything.

42
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,223
Father!

43
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,307
What is it?

44
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,060
Goodness.

45
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,396
-Hello, Father.
-Hi.

46
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,613
Okay, that's enough.

47
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,825
-Will you be okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,630
He said he wanted to come,
so I brought him here.

49
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,883
I didn't know
so many of you would be here.

50
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,430
What's going on?

51
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,100
Don't worry.

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,943
Thank you

53
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
for greeting me

54
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,949
with such reverence.

55
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,830
I am thankful to the Lord

56
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,043
for his grace and lofty will.

57
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,882
Now that Christmas has come,
let us reflect on…

58
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
He's not in his right mind.
Christmas was days ago.

59
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,054
…our foolishness, which led us to doubt…

60
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,972
Just wait.

61
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,726
…and neglect his intricate plan
that we couldn't dare fathom.

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,563
Do repent for such mistakes in your past.

63
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,111
We are here on earth
while the Lord is high above us…

64
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,577
Wait, where are the altar boys?

65
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,414
And why are there
no liturgical objects here?

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,458
Heavens.

67
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,753
Who's reading the Bible today?

68
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,222
-Man, it went out again.
-Don't worry about it.

69
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,685
Yun-sang, why don't you take
Father Baek and leave?

70
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,771
You'll catch a cold, Father.

71
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,439
Yeah, hurry up and go.

72
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,734
It's cold here even with the heater on
because the ceilings are high.

73
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,902
Take him home.

74
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,321
Patients are extra vulnerable this winter.

75
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,365
With no medicine,
there's little we can do.

76
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,992
Yeah, we don't want him
to get terribly ill.

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,702
Go.

78
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,457
My wife beat COVID.
Now she might die from a simple cold.

79
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,458
Come on!

80
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,126
Why is it so noisy outside?

81
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:23,091
I heard the prisons have failed.
Are the rioters here?

82
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,719
Someone go and take a look outside!

83
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,890
Father, let's go.

84
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,308
Okay.

85
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,979
I mean, what's all the commotion?

86
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,204
I heard the prisons have been destroyed.

87
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,790
Are the rioters barging in?

88
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,958
Goodness, Father.

89
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,627
-Call Mr. Cho, the chief of staff.
-Okay.

90
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,965
Tell him to maintain the security
of Woongcheon, okay?

91
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,844
Where on earth is Mr. Cho right now?

92
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,346
Call him right away.

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,600
Tell him to secure the safety
of Woongcheon, okay?

94
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,686
-It's a mess here right now!
-Okay!

95
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:23,192
END OF THE WORLD
ASTEROID COLLISION IN 200 DAYS

FLOATING BUNKER PRESENTATION

107
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,424
Dear citizens of Woongcheon,

108
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,094
there are only 20 days left
until the asteroid collision.

109
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,223
Though it cannot be confirmed

110
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,142
and we hope it is not true,

111
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,688
the kidnapping and trafficking
of children and adolescents

112
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,857
appears to be occurring again.

113
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,819
It may be best to refrain from
going outside at night, and…

114
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,707
The asteroid will arrive…

115
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,211
in 20 days.

116
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,381
May you find happiness

117
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,259
in the remaining days.

118
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,386
Thank you.

119
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,152
Great job, ma'am. You were amazing.

120
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,159
So that was our last broadcast.

121
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,160
I know.

122
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,998
See you on the outside.

123
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,378
Damn, I'm done with this now.

124
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,737
APPLICATION FOR BIOGRAPHY

125
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,040
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

126
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,833
Hey, this is private information.

127
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,213
I won't look, okay?

128
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,532
By the way, have you moved in for good?

129
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,495
Yeah. We have a bunch of stuff
we need to do together.

130
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,126
You mean this? Your bucket list?

131
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,962

You're gonna be really busy.

136
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,682
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

137
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,226
What should we do first?

138
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,938
Not sure.

139
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,204
Thank you.

140
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,748
I didn't know what to do.

141
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,251
They won't even think
to look for you here.

142
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,962
No one looks twice
at the neighborhood nutcase now.

143
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,507
Um…

144
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,968
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

145
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,221
Do you have any meat?

146
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,139
Meat?

147
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,184
Well, Jin-seo can't eat meat.

148
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,269
Why not?

149
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,478
Because you quit meat.

150
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,314
He ate it all, so there's none left.

151
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,316
I'll get some the next time you visit.

152
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,277
Careful. It's hot.

153
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,075
Is it okay?

154
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,119
I haven't tasted it yet.

155
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,413
How is it?

156
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,915
-Not bad, huh?
-Good.

157
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:42,928
TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE

158
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,704
Goodness.

159
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,666
Goodness me.

160
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,629
We are never going to…

161
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,383
end our lives this way.

162
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,434
Oh dear!

163
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,144
Hey, why did you come out?

164
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,901
You said we should starve ourselves
and wait until we die.

165
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,156
Well, it's harder than I thought.

166
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,576
Bibim-guksu.

167
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,912
What?

168
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,333
I want to eat bibim-guksu.

169
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,346
They probably went somewhere safe, right?

170
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,982
-Should we pile it up?
-Yeah.

171
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,401
-It's hard now.
-Hard.

172
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,863
You can't expect me to send them away
to some strangers.

173
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,823
I know.

174
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,617
I know, but…

175
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,333
This city is getting
more and more violent.

176
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,129
It's more dangerous for them here.

177
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,720
We don't know what it's like there.

178
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,308
No one has been there.

179
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,943
What if they're forced into labor
or sexually assaulted…

180
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,034
What if they experience
something terrible?

181
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,665
And, honestly,
I don't know if they'll agree to go.

182
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,920
Hae-chan, Woo-chan, aren't you cold?

183
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,129
-No!
-No.

184
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,008
You have to play together, not alone.

185
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes, that's it.

186
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,845
I'll scold them if they bully you.

187
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,267
Don't bother the others like that, okay?

188
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,149
Only authorized personnel
are allowed here!

189
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
You should go!

190
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,446
They've got to be kidding me.

191
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,284
Ms. Jin, you can't come here. Go!

192
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,702
Okay.

193
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,083
Men and women alike,
they are crazy over these chickens.

194
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,965
It's cold, huh?

195
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,967
Somehow, this thing kind of feels warm.

196
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,635
-Although it isn't.
-Yeah.

197
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,387
We have no fuel.

198
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,305
-There you are.
-You startled me!

199
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,890
I was just in the area.

200
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
What, this works?

201
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,394
-No. The military ran out of gas too.
-No.

202
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,688
I'll give you my warmth.

203
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,775
So how did the candidates react?

204
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,487
Well,

205
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,740
they're not exactly thrilled.

206
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,705
We're trying to send the kids away
since it's dangerous.

207
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,082
But, Se-kyung,

208
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,961
I've been informed
that the terms have changed.

209
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
They've gotten stricter.

210
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,430
So I was hoping
Capt. Kang could make it public

211
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,682
and help us in this matter.

212
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,935
People here listen to you
more than they do me.

213
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,648
Is anyone in our neighborhood eligible?

214
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,359
From our neighborhood,
Woo-chan and Hae-chan.

215
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,569
Woo-chan and Hae-chan.

216
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,238
Let's do it.

217
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,949
Let's send them.

218
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,828
We might be letting our own fear
make us worry over nothing.

219
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,790
They could actually be sent
to a good place!

220
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,421
We can't let them live like this,
waiting for death.

221
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,345
Young-ji, I said
you don't have to help out anymore.

222
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,805
14 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

223
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,976
Goodness, it's cold.

224
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,073
Sister.

225
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,535
What would you do if you were to die
tomorrow and not in two weeks?

226
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,579
I'd do the exact same thing.

227
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,998
The same thing? And what's that?

228
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,294
Well, all I know how to do
is pray and serve.

229
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,671
Come on, that's just church stuff.

230
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,760
Would my life be any different
if I died tomorrow?

231
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,347
I'll just have to do what I can.

232
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,732
What's wrong?
You don't want to go to volunteer work?

233
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,651
You're being really strange today.

234
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,369
The weather is cold, and so is my heart.

235
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,632
Hi there.

236
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,052
Where did you come from?

237
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,306
You can't eat that. You're hungry, huh?

238
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,561
It's a good thing
you didn't get eaten by people.

239
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,439
They say that if dogs love you,
that means you're a good person.

240
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,024
If I die first,

241
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,777
I'd love for this dog to eat me.

242
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,822
What an audacious thing to say.

243
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,200
But I don't have the courage to die
and be your food right now.

244
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,288
If you really die,
the scarier dogs will come for you.

245
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,209
Don't you hear
the asteroid coming to get us?

246
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,796
That kind of joke isn't funny at all.

247
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,133
Let's go.

248
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,602
Let's play soccer!

249
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,314
Why are you here alone?

250
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,607
Se-kyung overslept.

251
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,445
Let's play, guys!

252
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,906
Ma'am!

253
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,199
Mess unit, get in there.

254
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,784
We have no one left to…

255
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,453
-Feed anyway!
-Feed anyway!

256
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,246
Let's go!

257
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,708
Here we go! We're playing soccer!

258
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,389
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,642
I know it's meaningless at this point.

260
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,435
Captain.

261
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,481
In-a.

262
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,525
They probably won't send a replacement.

263
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,902
I'd like you to take over.

264
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,823
I hope nothing happens,

265
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,785
but keep an eye on the troublemakers
so they don't cause any trouble.

266
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,290
You'll find live ammo in there.

267
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:32,958
SNACK STORAGE

268
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,210
It's enough to arm all the soldiers.

269
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,462
All thanks to Mess Sergeant So.

270
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,381
The missing ammunition incident--

271
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,590
It's a long story.

272
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,385
But don't worry. The ammunition is clean.

273
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:47,931
I'm sorry

274
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,475
for dumping all this on you.

275
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,942
You're the commander of this unit now.

276
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,447
So do a good job.

277
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,786
Captain!

278
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,678
Please work.

279
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,519
Hang in there.

280
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,446
In-a.

281
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,907
You look different today.

282
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
Where's Se-kyung?

283
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
"This is goodbye."

284
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,217
In-a, what are you…

285
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,562
You seemed to like running into operations
and shooting guns.

286
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,523
Why didn't you become a soldier or a cop?

287
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,194
I don't like the uniform.

288
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:33,912
After venting on my mom,
I came to a decision.

289
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,795
Where do you get the energy?
From all the squats you do?

290
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,296
Come on!

291
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,382
Just listen. I'm serious.

292
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,351
I realized that I've lived
a dull life until now.

293
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,942
Why are you looking back
on your life all of a sudden?

294
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,194
I wanted to get recognized so much.

295
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,867
That led me to think I had to
take responsibility for everything.

296
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,205
Please stop. What are you trying to say?

297
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,540
And I…

298
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,880
did get overprotective
and overanxious about you at times.

299
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,216
You're not apologizing, are you?

300
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,051
As if.

301
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,556
Instead…

302
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,737
You have the gun, right?

303
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:33,949
Yeah.

304
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,043
You do the protecting.

305
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,370
I hereby report
that I was formally discharged

306
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,998
on February 8th, 2026.

307
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,296
In-a!

308
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,805
You've done well…

309
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,394
this whole time.

310
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,878
10 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

311
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,652
Not that.

312
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,905
You crazy-ass junkie!

313
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,077
You said you knew some kids, right?

314
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,621
This is your last chance.

315
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,667
Three kids for one boarding pass.

316
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,585
Okay.

317
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,669
What's it gonna be?

318
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,964
Just three kids, right?

319
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,882
Of course.

320
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,181
You crazy bastard.
Your eyes look ridiculous!

321
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,144
Three will do.

322
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,690
-Hey, let's go to the den.
-Yes, sir.

323
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,608
Good job.

324
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,067
Good work.

325
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,780
It looks like those bastards
are putting kids in containers

326
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,033
and shipping them off again.

327
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:57,253
Since this is their last job,
they're just bent on hitting the number,

328
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,797
so they might be careless.

329
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,093
It's the last ship they will send
before the asteroid hits.

330
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,983
Woo-chan, what should we pack?

331
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,069
This and this.

332
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,070
Let's see.

333
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,906
-Okay.
-The penguin?

334
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,659
-You'll take the penguin too?
-Yeah!

335
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,078
-And the dinosaurs.
-Okay.

336
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,456
Let's pack everything for now.
Bring them here, Woo-chan.

337
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,214
Woo-chan…

338
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,966
Hae-chan, do you need help?

339
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,845
So-min, I don't want to go.

340
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,055
I'm scared.

341
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,938
Don't worry too much.

342
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,817
There'll be lots of food there,
and it won't be cold.

343
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,738
You and Woo-chan will make
a lot of good friends.

344
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,660
Hae-chan.

345
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,250
You and Woo-chan need to go
and live a happy life there.

346
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,877
But why only us?

347
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,463
What about So-min? What about you?

348
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,884
You know what?

349
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,263
I'll come visit you two no matter what.

350
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,806
Liar.

351
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,480
Hae-chan, let me hug you.

352
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,984
Let me hug you. Woo-chan, you too.

353
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,945
Let Auntie give you a hug!

354
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,827
And my daughter. Come here.

355
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,167
That's my girl.

356
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,798
The world falls into ruin,

357
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,301
but with you by my side,
I'd sacrifice everything--

358
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,970
Just go and move our stuff.

359
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,889
What shall we eat for dinner?

360
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,485
Don't know.

361
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,486
Really?

362
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,907
HI, THIS IS SUPERMAN AND WONDERMART
THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO CLOSE UP SHOP

363
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,172
I'll carry that.

364
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,427
It's okay, but thank you.

365
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,388
Are you doing okay?

366
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,684
Yeah.

367
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,605
Are you going out to work again?

368
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,525
No, I'm taking the older ladies
for a drive.

369
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,821
Do you want to come too?

370
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,327
Should I?

371
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:04,584
Goodness, I guess our soccer team is done
now that Ji-eun and Mi-ryeong are leaving.

372
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,420
Come on, they're not leaving for good.

373
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,089
Don't you worry.
When the time comes, they'll all return.

374
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,174
Isn't that right?

375
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,384
Yes, that's right.

376
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,511
I'll come back again.

377
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,808
But will you really be okay
when you're with child?

378
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:24,979
Yes.

379
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,524
But

380
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,028
there's a chance we won't come back.

381
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,698
Where are you heading? Take me with you
if you're going someplace nice.

382
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,366
It's nothing like that.

383
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,454
Sister, there are no nice places
left in this world.

384
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,374
This church is the best place to be
to find your way to heaven.

385
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,919
Yes, that's true.

386
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,337
What is all this?

387
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,755
Oh, Father.

388
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,592
I brought some stuff here
after cleaning out the supermarket.

389
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,846
Sister, you're leaving again?

390
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,687
Sung-jae.

391
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,607
Oh my.

392
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,610
Were they that close?

393
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,740
Mi-ryeong!

394
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,667
Mi-ryeong!

395
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,378
You should call him "Father."

396
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,923
Dae-han.

397
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,260
Keep lying to yourself, and you'll go
to hell alone when the world ends.

398
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,096
You do have a face
that's well-suited for hell.

399
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,516
Let's go to heaven.
I'm leaving this guy behind.

400
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,741
I'm off to see Ms. Kim.

401
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,661
Need a ride?

402
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,873
I'll keep the chatter short.

403
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,179
Is In-a going to come back?

404
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,274
Why is the door open?

405
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,861
For ventilation while I'm cleaning.

406
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,696
Have a seat.

407
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,198
Is Se-kyung going somewhere?

408
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,450
She's going to visit Bo-ae.

409
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,912
So she went out to work.

410
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,000
Too bad. I came to offer some prayers
for you newlyweds.

411
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,801
You brought out the homemade liquor.
Shall we drink it all tonight?

412
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,139
You know, a while back…

413
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,057
Yeah?

414
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,561
You said

415
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:17,151
that I only saw Se-kyung
as a cheerful and generous person, right?

416
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,820
Did I?

417
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,743
I think I did see her that way
at the time.

418
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,205
And it's true I liked her for that.

419
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,375
But it's different now.

420
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:40,591
I don't feel like I need to be by her side
or I need to protect her.

421
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,179
She's just…

422
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,558
someone I'll be with to the end.

423
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,312
That is very special.

424
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,988
We'll all die together in ten days.

425
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,157
Does that mean…

426
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,287
we're all special to each other?

427
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,878
Help me if you want to be special!

428
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,422
Why, yes, sir.

429
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,841
I'll take special care in cleaning.

430
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,389
How much have you cleaned so far?

431
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,142
Can't you tell?

432
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,393
Following you, sir.

433
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,811
Follow my lead, sir!

434
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,073
I don't want this.

435
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,867
Please stop it.

436
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,035
You're pretty.

437
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,665
Ms. Jin.

438
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,377
I don't want to get married.

439
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,422
Then you don't have to.

440
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,510
But, Ms. Jin, you got married, right?

441
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,805
I did get married,

442
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,892
but I can't say that it's great.

443
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,606
If you got married,
why are you telling me not to?

444
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,359
I know, right?

445
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,623
Why did I tell the kids
not to do so many things?

446
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,086
Are you crying, Ms. Jin?

447
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,547
Don't cry.

448
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,717
I know why you're being like this.

449
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,806
No.

450
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,976
No one knows. No one.

451
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,941
Even I don't know anymore.

452
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,989
If I had killed your son,

453
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,743
would things have turned out differently?

454
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,705
What if I followed my students
after they had died?

455
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:21,001
No, what if I pursued my studies
like my boyfriend did?

456
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,428
For both you

457
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,013
and me…

458
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,269
if this is the result of our choices…

459
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,314
I imagine a world…

460
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,361
where we make different choices.

461
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,239
Even though it's meaningless.

462
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,452
I don't want that.

463
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,037
I don't want that.

464
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:14,680
These are the only things I have left.
The ones you can actually use.

465
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,643
You know how to use them, right?

466
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:28,110
Those guys are badasses.
They have no mercy.

467
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,030
I know. But I brought this on myself.

468
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,991
But the end is near. Why bother…

469
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,527
It was you?

470
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,279
Why are you so surprised?

471
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,951
Where's Ha-yul?

472
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:27,878
Ha-yul…

473
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,471
Ms. Jin.

474
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:43,227
Did you see any rough-looking men
on your way here?

475
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,730
Do you see men like that out there?

476
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,482
It's crazy these days.

477
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,068
We're so scared
that we can't even go outside--

478
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,740
You didn't see…

479
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,536
Sergeant Kim nearby, did you?

480
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,289
I didn't.

481
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,057
SERGEANT KIM

482
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,272
You guys can live if you leave.

483
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,441
I'll treat you nicely
and give you a gun too.

484
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,776
Jeong Ha-yul, bring both of your friends.

485
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,282
Don't do anything dangerous, Ms. Jin.

486
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,619
You'll really die if…

487
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,541
Why would I die?

488
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,046
I'm not going to die, okay?

489
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,050
If I have to die, I will die…

490
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,638
after I see you guys

491
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,766
grow up into adults.

492
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,476
Then…

493
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,065
I don't want to become an adult.

494
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,753
I didn't know.

495
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,089
Everything kept passing by,

496
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,800
but I didn't even realize it.

497
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,183
Take me there.

498
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,478
To my grave on the mountain ridge.

499
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,199
Wait.

500
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,286
Goodbye

501
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,289
to this world.

502
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,962
Goodbye, my neighborhood.

503
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,133
Goodbye now,

504
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,054
mothers and fathers.

505
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,351
The spontaneous musical clock.

506
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,779
And the garden we all tended to, farewell.

507
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,951
The delicious food and coffee.

508
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,584
The freshly ironed clothes
and bathhouses steaming with hot water.

509
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,549
Falling asleep

510
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,969
and waking up.

511
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,476
Dear Earth,
that no one knows the true value of

512
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,522
for it is so beautiful and magnificent…

513
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,360
goodbye.
