FLOATING BUNKER PRESENTATION

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,652
Hey, why isn't your teacher coming?

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,239
Did she abandon you?

15
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,535
Stop.

16
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,746
-What are you doing?
-Ms. Jin!

17
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,247
-Speak of the devil.
-Move.

18
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,711
We could use your help. She won't listen.

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,547
Ms. Jin, I really wasn't trying
to do anything bad.

20
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,383
Help with what?

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,387
She's not paying her maintenance fee.
I know her business is thriving.

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,307
I told her we accept ration tickets,
but she won't pay up.

23
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,355
Ration tickets.

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,946
Take all you want. This is all I have.

25
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,241
So-min, come here.

26
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,121
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,038
I'm okay.

28
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,581
Good.

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,836
I want that.

30
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,217
Are you sure you're okay?

31
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,219
-Yes.
-You must be scared.

32
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,554
Yes.

33
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,721
-It's okay.
-Hey, lady.

34
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,225
He said you should buy a new bike.

35
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,312
"Just you wait.
I'll make things fun for you."

36
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:37,407
JUST YOU WAIT
I'LL MAKE THINGS FUN FOR YOU

37
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,834
When the time stands still
You're asleep, I come to you

38
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,005
The world gets in my way
But I end up by your side

39
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:57,343
My long journey's finally over
And now I go back

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:02,056
Back to you, my home
Again, I'm on my way back home

41
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,856
The world might end tomorrow,
but today I dance!

42
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,733
I'm gonna dance!

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,739
Sister! Great moves!

44
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,365
You used to party back in the day!

45
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,537
It's just like a drawer

46
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,207
That keeps opening by itself

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,334
You fly high up to the sky

48
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,836
But you always come back to me

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,422
Leaving you was never easy

50
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,008
Everything's how we left it

51
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,887
All together now!

52
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,974
You said she'd be right back.

53
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,393
She's on her way. It was nothing serious.

54
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,897
Here's a gift!

55
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,066
A gift?

56
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,484
Thank you!

57
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:59,822
These are the last two bottles I have,
so my heart is breaking.

58
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,034
Go have fun.
Enjoy the wine somewhere else.

59
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,037
Go. I'll clean up here. Go!

60
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,171
You…

61
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,841
Do you really want to see your mom dead?

62
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,842
Who, you?

63
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,346
I doubt that would happen.
You said you wanted to live!

64
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,430
What was that?

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,433
So-min, stop it. Go inside.

66
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,944
My baby.

67
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,324
Ms. Jin, this child is so immature.

68
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,410
Why do I have to be mature? You aren't.

69
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,370
-You brat!
-Hey.

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,128
Yeah, your mother is ignorant,
uneducated, and immature.

71
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,629
It must be nice to be smart.

72
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,840
Where was she?

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,800
Gye Hyang, it's late. Go inside.

74
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,094
-I'll leave this here.
-Bye.

75
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,929
-Bye.
-Se-kyung, I'm really sorry.

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,097
Good night, Gye Hyang.

77
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,057
Se-kyung!

78
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,977
Hey.

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,897
Are you okay?

80
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,108
Yeah. The car ran out of gas, that's all.

81
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,404
I dropped the car off at the church
and walked here.

82
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,072
Let's go.

83
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,909
Let's go!

84
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,329
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

85
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,830
-Don't touch me.
-I touched you?

86
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,711
When was the last time
we took a night walk together like this?

87
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,339
I know, right?

88
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,050
It feels like ages ago.

89
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,011
-So you have butterflies?
-What?

90
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,514
That's what you said earlier.

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,103
No, I'm just wondering
if Yun-sang is okay.

92
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,648
What about you?

93
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,610
Are you really okay?

94
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,032
Cheers.

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,376
This stuff is so good!
I should've drank more of it when I could.

96
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,753
A guy once said
he didn't get drinking wine

97
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,963
because it was distasteful yet expensive.

98
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,549
Now, who was that guy?

99
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,551
-Me?
-That's what you said.

100
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,720
Then you called Sung-jae "pretentious."

101
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,641
What an act of blasphemy.

102
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,185
Truly blasphemous.

103
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,148
I wish we could spend
our last moments like this too.

104
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,858
Did we finish it?

105
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,819
Yeah, it's empty.

106
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,487
We drank it all.

107
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,571
Yes, we did.

108
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,367
Still, it feels good.

109
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,080
When did you get those?

110
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,750
Well-prepared as always.

111
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,337
Congratulations.

112
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,757
Big congratulations in advance!

113
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,719
Save the dance, please.

114
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,179
-Se-kyung.
-Yeah?

115
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,722
You still do soccer these days?

116
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,396
-Sung-jae!
-What?

117
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,816
Those aren't soccer cleats.
They are for mountain biking.

118
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,484
Try to catch up, Father!

119
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,905
Did you say "do soccer"?
Are you trying to sound dumb or what?

120
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,657
Or is that a way of sounding humble?

121
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,621
Drink more.

122
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,417
Someone's gonna get tipsy.

123
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,881
It's getting late.
Let's finish Se-kyung's glass and leave.

124
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,049
No, you should leave when the curfew ends.

125
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,759
-I have more drinks.
-It's okay.

126
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,596
-I have more drinks. Come.
-You do?

127
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,431
-"Go."
-My grandma made it.

128
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,557
Have a taste.

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,225
-In-a, you should try it.
-What?

130
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,103
Yeah, let's have a little taste.
What do you say?

131
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,606
Yun-sang, you remember this, right?

132
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,858
She made this
a month before she passed away.

133
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,693
Yeah, I do remember.

134
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,572
But I also remember
that it was made for a different occasion.

135
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,867
She wanted us to keep it
and drink it at our wedding.

136
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,036
When will the four of us
drink together again?

137
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,204
Let's have one more--

138
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,748
-No, we have somewhere to go.
-Just one more drink.

139
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,041
-Come on!
-Shall we?

140
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,459
-Hey.
-We're leaving!

141
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,879
Are soldiers and priests allowed
to break curfew and wander around?

142
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,173
What? No, we are going on a patrol.

143
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,925
Sung-jae, we talked about this.

144
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,968
He's exempt tonight
since he's my assistant.

145
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,220
How admirable!

146
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,137
I opened the lid.

147
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,639
-Thanks for your service.
-In-a.

148
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,641
Have another drink before you go.

149
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,267
-We'll get going.
-We should hurry…

150
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,852
Off you go.

151
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,312
-Bye.
-Good night!

152
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,695
Isn't it a miracle?

153
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,449
Yun-sang and Se-kyung being together
in that warm, loving light.

154
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,453
Seriously, please.
Stop being so sentimental.

155
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,455
This is the Martial Law Command.

156
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,873
-In-a.
-What?

157
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,792
-Capt. Kang.
-What?

158
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm exempt, right?

159
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,296
Is it really okay for me
to be out during curfew?

160
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,799
It is.

161
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,300
Yeah?

162
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,431
You offered that up so easily.

163
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,393
She made that for our wedding.

164
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,945
You want to have a wedding?

165
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,701
That's the reason I came back.

166
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,497
That's all I have left now.

167
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,503
To give you the best moment of your life.

168
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,651
It still does that.

169
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,488
I find it funny how it goes off randomly.

170
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,338
For now, let's clean up before we sleep.

171
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,719
For now?

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,721
Yeah.

173
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,314
Easy.

174
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,320
Why are you trying to carry
all those in one hand?

175
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,031
I don't know why,
but I've always wanted to try this.

176
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,993
-It looks cool, you know.
-Be careful.

177
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,750
Are you okay?

178
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,840
Serves me right.

179
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,759
Don't you think?

180
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,011
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
Se-kyung…

182
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,144
It's okay, Se-kyung.

183
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,813
Wait just a sec.

184
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,815
-I said it's okay.
-No, Yun-sang.

185
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,483
-Let me.
-Se-kyung.

186
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,527
-I'll do it. What's with you today?
-No!

187
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,787
-I'll put the Band-Aid on after I wash it.
-Fine.

188
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,900
Why this neighborhood of all places?

189
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,197
To ensure public safety around here.

190
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,827
And I also remembered that you know
a few people in this part of town.

191
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey, I only know a handful of people.

192
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,999
It was Father Baek who had the big shots
in the palm of his hands.

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,256
The apocalypse doesn't seem
to affect this place.

194
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,217
Doesn't the curfew start in 30 minutes?
In-a, watch out.

195
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,513
He should not be riding in a narrow alley.

196
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,478
Father! What brings you here at this hour?

197
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,730
Have a seat. I'll make you some noodles.

198
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,191
No, thank you.
My friend here just got a little lost.

199
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,360
There's still no news
on Father Baek, is there?

200
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,529
Unfortunately not.

201
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,741
Oh no! I'm so worried about him!

202
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,370
The thing is, he appeared
in my dream and said, "Stella!"

203
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,247
He called me by my baptismal name.

204
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,833
"Stella, confess your sins!"

205
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,751
Hyeon-sik.

206
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,254
Hey, Kim Hyeon-sik.
You with the long hair, what's your deal?

207
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,589
Come here.

208
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,091
-Come over here, kid.
-Okay.

209
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,804
Hey, this is chicken.

210
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,722
Have it all for yourself.

211
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,224
Thank you, sir.

212
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,141
Sergeant Kim?

213
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,060
-Yes?
-Come here.

214
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,022
-Hey, give me one of those.
-Yes, sir.

215
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,943
This will take you to another world.

216
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,528
No, thanks.

217
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,780
-It's a new product.
-What?

218
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,323
-This stuff is strong.
-I'm okay.

219
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,242
Just take it, kiddo.

220
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,787
I'm just saying you'll end up dead
if you take it all at once, boy.

221
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,706
Thank you.

222
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,041
Go jerk off like crazy.

223
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,292
Yes, sir. Thank you.

224
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,170
When can I go to confess?

225
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,675
I have to confess all of my sins
before the asteroid comes.

226
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,262
What do I do?

227
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,890
-I'll be able to go to heaven, right?
-Yes.

228
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,309
I mean, this is the only way
I can make a living.

229
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,531
The brothel and the gambling house
are connected.

230
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,161
It might look like First Sergeant Park
is running them with discharged soldiers,

231
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,206
but the escaped convicts
are managing everything.

232
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,959
I've sent countless anonymous reports,

233
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,128
but the Joint Investigation Unit
won't budge.

234
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,214
Are you saying the JIU is protecting
the escaped convicts?

235
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,425
I think there's someone above the JIU.

236
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,428
There's a rumor going around

237
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,431
that the money from this area
is being funneled into one place.

238
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,559
By the way, Capt. Kang,

239
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,354
the JIU is still looking for
the missing ammunition.

240
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,442
Will it be okay for you
to take part in this operation?

241
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,290
197 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

242
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,959
Greetings, citizens of Woongcheon.

243
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,628
This is Deputy Mayor Im Seon-ju.

244
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,214
All supplies are running short,
including daily necessities.

245
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,594
And the city is rampant
with various frauds promising escape.

246
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:35,267
We declare that Woongcheon City will take
strong action against all crimes.

247
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,771
By joining hands
with the Martial Law Command…

248
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,028
-Yun-sang.
-Oh God!

249
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,446
-Sorry.
-Se-kyung.

250
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,865
I'm taking off.

251
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,867
I wanted to give you a ride.

252
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,203
But I just can't fix this thing.

253
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,956
No, it's okay. I'll see you tonight.

254
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,958
Okay.

255
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,042
-Se-kyung.
-Yeah?

256
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,003
Your bike isn't here.

257
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,005
It's at the city hall.

258
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,927
Bye.

259
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,972
See you tonight.

260
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,484
We were born as men

261
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,487
Of all the things men must do

262
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,948
You and I lived for the honor…

263
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,965
Don't go this way. Go to the coop!

264
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,802
Ma'am, I have something
to discuss with you.

265
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,390
-Captain.
-Yeah?

266
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,892
I'd like you to attend
the completion ceremony.

267
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,477
The completion ceremony?

268
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,104
Yes, it's right this way.

269
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,439
Fall into formation.

270
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,775
Second platoon returning from night shift.

271
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,985
-Okay.
-Ma'am.

272
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,653
Good work.

273
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,364
Sergeant Kim Hyeon-sik,
when are you leaving the army?

274
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,327
-Good work.
-Thank you, ma'am.

275
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,753
All right.

276
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:31,258
Our first and last fertility project
will be a success no matter what.

277
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,969
To the chief,
and to the rest of the tribe,

278
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,679
salute.

279
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,014
Salute!

280
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,807
As you were.

281
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,895
Now we will proceed
with the ribbon cutting.

282
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,565
Let's go!

283
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,485
You did a good job.
This will last ten years!

284
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,570
We have 198 days left, sir.

285
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,656
It's 197 days.

286
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,574
Give it up!

287
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,494
Where's Pang? Is he off-duty?

288
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,496
-I'm here, sir!
-Right.

289
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,583
Let's go. Please, just go!

290
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,878
That chicken's killing him.
Hey, take it easy!

291
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,129
Thank you, sir.

292
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,173
I was talking to the chicken.

293
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,928
Climb up, please.

294
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,847
Isn't that the hen?
Why can't they tell the difference?

295
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,765
Sergeant.

296
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,018
I want a one-on-one
with every sergeant in each platoon.

297
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,729
-Let's start with the headquarters.
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,856
Ms. Jin said not to go out and about.

299
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,944
If we pay the collectors,
they give it to the managers.

300
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,279
Who do the managers pay, then?

301
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,031
Any remaining powerful people?

302
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,827
But it's not even in dollars.
The real rich people left a long time ago.

303
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,124
Right at the last moment,
when the government-in-exile leaves Korea,

304
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
they'll be issuing national bonds
in exchange for banknotes.

305
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,253
That's what my dad said.

306
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,048
You sound really smart,
but I didn't understand any of that.

307
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,218
Does that mean
the Korean government is moving?

308
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,139
-To where?
-North Korea will move to western China.

309
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,685
It will become an autonomous region.
China's gonna make some room for them.

310
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,103
I don't care about all that.

311
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,940
I want to make a deal with someone
like Sergeant Kim and buy a gun.

312
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,024
Keep it down.

313
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,777
The kids can hear you.

314
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,824
So are you saying
you're going to make a deal with him

315
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,369
by giving him what he wants?
Dirty, homemade videos or whatever?

316
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,669
Ma'am. Sergeant Kim Hyeon-sik reporting.

317
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,506
Hi. Sit down.

318
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,428
I know you worked the night shift.
Sorry to wake you up.

319
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,433
I heard you offered to work overnight
in place of your subordinates.

320
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,771
The command wants us to discharge
all those who apply, regardless of rank.

321
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,526
But you haven't applied yet
when your discharge is way overdue.

322
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,655
They want fewer mouths to feed
'cause supplies are low.

323
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,244
If you ask me, I'd rather
we stay together until the very end,

324
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:10,542
but… should anyone think it's meaningless
to remain a soldier in this situation,

325
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,629
I will respect their decision.

326
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,716
It's not that I have
no complaints here, but…

327
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,889
If you could enjoy your life in abundance
with like-minded people,

328
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,477
I don't see a reason for you
to maintain your status as a soldier.

329
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,689
I don't really have any plans,

330
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,109
and there's nothing much
I can do out there anyway.

331
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,698
If that's the case, let's try to get along
in the remaining time.

332
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,620
As a member of the army,
if you have any inappropriate connections,

333
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,914
I advise you to cut ties with them.

334
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,043
-Yes, ma'am.
-Come to me if you need help.

335
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,295
I'll be waiting.

336
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,641
Did she fucking see something?

337
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,186
Shit, that was spooky as hell.

338
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,730
Fuck.

339
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,949
Damn it,
are you seriously sleeping right now?

340
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,289
What you gonna do about the bunker?

341
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,874
You scared me. Seriously.

342
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,837
-That's why you're here?
-Aren't you gonna go for it?

343
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,298
Are you just gonna sit here and die?

344
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,052
You can go ahead if you have the money.

345
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,304
For God's sake.

346
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,810
-Why is he always wearing sunglasses?
-Dae-han, is Mi-ryeong here?

347
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,062
-Yun-sang, welcome.
-Hi.

348
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,484
Is that the US guy?

349
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,573
I heard you came from the US.

350
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,659
Yes.

351
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,328
Well,

352
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,581
my daughter, Ha-yul,
used to be Ms. Jin's student,

353
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,750
so I know Ms. Jin very well.

354
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,252
Hi, how are you?

355
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,046
I wish I could say I was good.

356
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,965
So… Watch out!

357
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,804
So I was wondering,

358
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,723
how did you get here?

359
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,266
Excuse me?

360
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,103
If you came here from the US,
you must know a way out of here.

361
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,813
I'd love to hear what you know.

362
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,858
Stop it.

363
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,153
Tell Mi-ryeong that I stopped by.

364
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,404
Don't do it.

365
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,784
-Are you okay?
-He's bleeding a lot.

366
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,285
-Don't cry.
-Poor boy.

367
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,912
Why are you crying?

368
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,538
Did he hurt himself?

369
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,874
He fell while jumping rope.

370
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,461
Hae-chan makes me jump rope all the time.

371
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,838
I don't want to jump rope.

372
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,966
You have to make your legs stronger.
Do as I say.

373
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,887
Woo-chan, here's some water.

374
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,139
Let's put a Baby Shark Band-Aid on it.

375
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,851
Why are you jumping rope so much?

376
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,313
We need strong legs
to run away to a high place.

377
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,523
High place? Where?

378
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,900
I found a place. It's high up.

379
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,946
Hey, do you think you'll survive
if you avoid the tsunami?

380
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,489
Hey, stop.

381
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,491
When the tsunami comes, we'll already be--

382
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,992
Enough, Jeong Ha-yul.

383
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,744
What did I do?

384
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,287
It's okay.

385
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,456
I know all that too.

386
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,167
-All done.
-Let's go.

387
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,839
Don't be mean to the kids.

388
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,133
What? I just told the truth!

389
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,300
-Oh my!
-They're kids.

390
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,136
Why is the house such a mess?

391
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,304
I cleaned up before I left this morning.

392
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:02,524
But it's such a relief
to see you all here in the house.

393
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,860
You just said we made a mess.

394
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,780
I'd rather you make a mess at home.

395
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,409
Do you know how anxious I get
when you're out of my sight?

396
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,958
You'll all eat before you go, right?

397
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,376
-Yes.
-Yes.

398
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,045
Okay, let's make potato pancakes.

399
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,132
Potato pancakes.

400
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,144
With the temperatures rising,

401
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,730
the unidentified bodies
are decomposing so badly.

402
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,526
And there are so many of them.
We'll need to forgo funerals from now on.

403
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,493
Se-kyung, you do have a bike.

404
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,494
-What?
-But…

405
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,829
You said your bike was totaled.
You got a new one?

406
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,830
No.

407
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,582
Oh wow.

408
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,920
Your taste in bikes is a little unusual,
but this is practically new.

409
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,756
I heard it's tough
to even get secondhand stuff.

410
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,841
-Good for you, Se-kyung.
-Yeah.

411
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,428
-Perfect for grocery shopping!
-Who goes shopping these days?

412
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,514
It'd be perfect
for a nice, breezy ride around here.

413
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,598
NO CALLER ID

414
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,768
But who put this pinwheel here?

415
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,316
Do you like the bike?

416
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,819
I'll give you the key in person.

417
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,295
This is bait, isn't it?

418
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,465
This is the second time.

419
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,719
He used So-min to feel me out yesterday,
and now he's making his move.

420
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,516
He would want to get rid of me
since I'm bad for his business.

421
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,482
You know what?

422
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,152
I can't handle this on my own.

423
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,408
I've been getting threats
since the day Yun-sang got back.

424
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,703
He called me out
during the welcome party too.

425
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,499
I guess he thinks
that I killed Bae Jong-su.

426
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,460
Text him to say you'll meet him.

427
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,088
Okay.

428
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,960
You all right?

429
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,132
I don't think…

430
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,887
Se-kyung will tell me
everything that happened.

431
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,307
She'll keep a few things secret.

432
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,812
We've all been through a lot.

433
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,940
Not the stuff you've all been through.

434
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,030
Here's some more advice.

435
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:41,034
We all want to enjoy the short time
we have left as best we can.

436
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,663
But to do that, we must resolve the issues
that have piled up in our lives.

437
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,498
The same goes for relationships.

438
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,792
What are you trying to say?

439
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,627
You were wrong from the beginning.

440
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,379
You said you fell for her

441
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,048
because she was cheerful
and generous, right?

442
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,092
But that's just the way you see her.

443
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,220
People are more complicated than that.

444
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,431
All the advice you give me

445
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,768
really seems like good advice
when I listen to it,

446
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,646
but it has no substance.

447
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,272
That's true.

448
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,608
That's my weakness.

449
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,028
Call me Mr. Good Advice.

450
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,823
-Father!
-Yes?

451
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,243
The phones must not be working again.
I tried to call you so many times.

452
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,244
You did?

453
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,498
You should go
and call the bishop's office.

454
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:33,002
Those old folks keep calling for me
when I don't even know much.

455
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,172
Don't call them old folks.
The Lord won't be happy with that.

456
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,010
I see a couple of slackers here.

457
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,263
This is no time to be playing tennis!

458
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,309
Hey, I'm getting scolded because of you.

459
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,310
Get going!

460
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,645
Okay.

461
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,192
Maybe they want you
to perform a memorial Mass?

462
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,110
What?

463
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,112
No way.

464
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,073
Take this, asteroid!

465
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,251
-Ma'am.
-Hey.

466
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,714
Ma'am.

467
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,133
-Sergeant.
-Yes.

468
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,969
Please handle
the shift inspection tonight.

469
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:05,887
Okay.

470
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,431
The platoon leader's heading out too.

471
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,390
So?

472
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,232
Understood, ma'am.

473
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,655
Special Missions Unit, begin operation.

474
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,881
Are you going to apply
for discharge this month?

475
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,800
I have nowhere to go,
and there's nothing for me to do.

476
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,345
Hey, you should go out and do
what you wanna do before the world ends.

477
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,263
That's true.

478
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,783
The subway stations will be shelters
when the asteroid hits?

479
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,829
That's freaking hilarious.

480
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,998
Oops, sorry.

481
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,591
I dropped the keys
on the Platform 2 tracks.

482
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,010
They'll be easy to find.

483
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,227
Be careful on your way.

484
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
RESTRICTED AREA

485
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,209
WOONGCHEON CITY
SHELTER NO. 3 CONSTRUCTION SITE

486
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,002
Did you think
you were a hero or something?

487
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,588
Look at you,
following orders because of a stupid bike.

488
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,427
Don't worry, Ms. Jin.

489
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,097
I'll take good care of the kids
until the very end.

490
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,774
What the hell?

491
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,755
Bae Jong-su.

492
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,591
Did you kill him?

493
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,011
Walk straight.

494
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,777
Go get it.

495
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,694
Just shoot me.

496
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
Just fucking shoot me!

497
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,294
You fucking…

498
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,758
Don't move!

499
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,643
We found the survivors.

500
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,855
Transport the survivors
to the city hospital for now.

501
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,940
Director Ri, please check inside.

502
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,193
Yeah.

503
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,777
Yes, go inside.

504
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,908
Capt. Kang mobilized
her old SMU teammates.

505
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,992
Let me go!

506
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,745
The isolation and safety
of the survivors are our priorities.

507
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,663
Man, this is total chaos.

508
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,207
I know we are short-staffed.

509
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,459
Request emergency volunteer workers.

510
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,795
Go up there and check things out.

511
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,380
-The JIU is here.
-Go with him.

512
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,050
I'll call you back. Yeah!

513
00:36:59,133 --> 00:36:59,967
Hello!

514
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,347
I didn't expect to see you at this hour.

515
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,515
Isn't the Special Missions Unit amazing?

516
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,186
They found out about the depraved activity
that was going on here.

517
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,106
It looks like
everything's been taken care of.

518
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,442
Hey, don't push!

519
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,902
Don't push me!

520
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:22,114
The JIU will be handling everything,
from the perpetrators to the victims.

521
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,825
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,036
Just take the perpetrators!

523
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,414
The teenage girls are clearly the victims!

524
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,043
No, they are survivors
under our jurisdiction.

525
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,628
Right, Lieutenant?

526
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,129
Is Capt. Kang behind this?

527
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,965
I'll give her a call.

528
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,468
Capt. Kang did give us the order.
You don't need to call her.

529
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,264
Take the victims to the health center
and return to your unit.

530
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,265
Understood.

531
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,600
Excuse me,

532
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,061
don't just investigate the perps.

533
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,189
Make sure you put them
behind bars this time!

534
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,567
To hell with your nonsense!

535
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,198
Report to Mr. Song.
Keep First Sergeant Park's mouth shut.

536
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,039
Team Bravo, mission accomplished.

537
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,084
People keep coming out.

538
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,277
We are

539
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,279
accomplices now, right?

540
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,047
In-a.

541
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,511
I only performed my duty as a soldier.

542
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,972
A citizen was in danger, so I saved her.

543
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,474
Nothing more.

544
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,352
So you should stop now.

545
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,148
Do you think that gang will give a hoot
about a few dead minions?

546
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,075
Why are you standing there? Let's go.

547
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,577
I'm not sure.

548
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,290
What are you on about? Get it together--

549
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,137
You said you would live to the end.

550
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,598
So why are you putting yourself in danger?

551
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,106
I don't know.

552
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,729
Leave with Yun-sang.

553
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,444
Get over here!

554
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,947
Come on!
