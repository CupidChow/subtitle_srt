1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,128
Yun-sang, come here.

2
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,629
Huh?

3
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,298
What is it?

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,639
It's okay.

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,308
I'm okay.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,644
Did you hear that?

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,605
Hear what?

8
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,566
No, never mind.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,693
It's nothing.

10
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:24,250

The next glass is for all the people
who loved Café Moira.

23
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,673
When the asteroid hits,
pretty much everyone will die.

24
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,091
They will all die anyway.

25
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,140
It's the express train to death.

26
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,058
Okay, everyone.

27
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,478
First, we're going to give you
a health checkup here at the hospital.

28
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,938
And then… You're here!

29
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,981
Evening, Father.

30
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,775
-Then we'll let you rest and play.
-Are you okay?

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,487
So listen to the doctors,
and be good during the checkup.

32
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,156
-Hi.
-Hello.

33
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,700
-Let's go inside.
-Young-ji!

34
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,285
Just follow the doctor.

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,953
Se-kyung.

36
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,289
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,457
Thank you.

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
I'll get my brother examined.

39
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,961
Se-kyung.

40
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,884
Please look after Yun-sang.
In-a and I are a bit busy.

41
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,719
-Stay in line.
-Okay.

42
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,514
This way.

43
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,143
No, you have to go inside.

44
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
-Director Ri.
-Yes?

45
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,900
I know you'll do well, but if the parents
or the investigators show up,

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,318
please call the base.

47
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,487
Their safety comes first.
I'll keep an eye out.

48
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,404
Thank you.

49
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,077
Things are pretty much wrapped up here.

50
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,791
How on earth did those punks
find out so quickly?

51
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,715
It doesn't look like you're hurt.

52
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,716
Capt. Kang.

53
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,593
Come with us.

54
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,221
Bring Private Na Hyeon-jae too.

55
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,932
Also, she's an accomplice,

56
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,393
he's a witness from the scene,
and the shooter--

57
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,310
Excuse me.

58
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,355
Can we do this tomorrow?

59
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,732
Why do you think
we're here in such a rush?

60
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,279
Do you seriously think
they're gonna run away?

61
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,947
-Ma'am.
-I mean, you--

62
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,408
I'll handle this.

63
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,582
Private Na is receiving treatment
right now.

64
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,169
And these two civilians
have no involvement in this incident.

65
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,087
Well, whatever.

66
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,632
You stay here.
Keep an eye on the one who got shot.

67
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,260
You can come alone, then.

68
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,345
I'll wait out front.

69
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,684
In-a.

70
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,313
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,156
Did you find the gold bars?

72
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,575
What?

73
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,079
I can't disclose that to you, Sister.

74
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,205
I'll see you later.

75
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,854
If Father Baek was still here,
he would've called them and said,

76
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,358
"I heard some of the members
of my church are being investigated."

77
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,692
"Will it take long?"

78
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,990
Just one call would've helped us.

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,920
Who are you?

80
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:32,975
You.

81
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,727
Who are you?

82
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,481
Put down the gun, or I'll open fire!

83
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,816
Who the hell are you?

84
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,367
Na Hyeon-jae?

85
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,035
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,080
Where exactly were you hurt?

87
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,129
You shot someone.

88
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,841
A man involved in the case
was aiming at a civilian--

89
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,925
"Involved"?

90
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,513
How did you know he was involved at all?

91
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,140
It seemed so, given the situation.

92
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,562
Did your captain order you to shoot?

93
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,480
That's not…

94
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,564
I see.

95
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,941
So you shot him for no reason.

96
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,628
MARTIAL LAW COMMAND, WOONGCHEON
JOINT INVESTIGATION UNIT

97
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,129
The curfew has been lifted.

98
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,383
The current time and date
is 5 a.m., September 4th, 2025.

99
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,809
Due process?

100
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,772
As it was an urgent situation,
it required an ex post facto approval.

101
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,900
The circumstances
of child confinement and abuse--

102
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,236
So you decided to trespass
onto private property.

103
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,154
On top of that, a civilian was shot.

104
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,865
In what universe would that be approved?

105
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,954
The gravity of the situation
called for an investigation.

106
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,039
A report was made by a victim,

107
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,625
and Clause Three, Section Two
of the martial law says--

108
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,669
That's not why martial law exists!

109
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
Capt. Kang.

110
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,638
Reverted to the national treasury.

111
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,685
If one person had that much, there must be
a lot more where that came from.

112
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,354
Funds for the escape, I guess?

113
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,149
I wonder how much the total cost would be

114
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,819
for a chartered plane,
investment, and settlement.

115
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,572
I did my own calculations.

116
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:38,494
Since it was a pyramid scheme,
I have no idea how many people signed up.

117
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,000
But most of those people
must've been scammed, don't you think?

118
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,836
In-seong was so handsome.

119
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,047
According to the kids,

120
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,510
Capt. Kang brought the military
to the scene and helped Ms. Jin,

121
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,512
which is why they were able to escape.

122
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,226
Since they were kids, In-a's always
been there to help Se-kyung when needed.

123
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,144
Right.

124
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,480
By the way, is your daughter okay?

125
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,398
Yes.

126
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,943
I felt like my heart had stopped.

127
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,738
But you know how kids are.

128
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,073
They're just playing
as if nothing happened.

129
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,576
Goodness, that's a relief, then.

130
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,496
With the way things are now,
you never know what's going to happen.

131
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,998
Oh my, careful!

132
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,251
Well, even so,

133
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:32,298
who could've guessed that the kids
would do something like that on their own?

134
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:41,515
Anyway, the kids said they saw gold bars.
Have you heard anything from the church?

135
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,603
I knew there was a reason
you suddenly volunteered to help.

136
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,687
No, it's…

137
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,939
Don't get me wrong.

138
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,902
The church was burned,
and the extension funds disappeared,

139
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,904
but now there's talk of gold bars, so…

140
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,575
Well, Sister Regina seemed curious
about that too.

141
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,493
Hey,

142
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,913
if we had just one of those gold bars,

143
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,374
we could all escape--

144
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,335
Start wiping.

145
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,503
-Okay.
-Careful.

146
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,798
How do they manage the gold?

147
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,800
What has the Board of Audit been doing?

148
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,803
Where did the gold found
at the training center come from?

149
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,431
I'm curious as to how the gold exchange
is viewing this situation.

150
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,599
So, usually,

151
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,937
gold ETF operators are supposed to have
gold in their actual possession.

152
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,732
They pay a fee and store it
in the vault of a trust bank.

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,612
This is insurance for any contingencies,
but it's only partially guaranteed. Why?

154
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,157
Because no thief would be able
to carry it all out anyway.

155
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,703
It is the responsibility
of the Board of Audit

156
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,248
to check if the gold ETF operators
have gold regularly.

157
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,791
So how did this happen?

158
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,004
All the money that disappeared
from the church was turned into gold,

159
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,257
but I don't find that surprising. Why?

160
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,344
When the stock markets are volatile,
people prefer safe assets like gold.

161
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,637
But here's the problem.

162
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,891
How on earth did they manage
to amass the massive pile of gold

163
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,310
that was found at the training center?

164
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:13,482
Gold is meant to be thoroughly managed
by ETF operators and the gold exchange,

165
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,444
yet a pile of it has just been found.

166
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,779
There's only one way to explain all this.

167
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,324
That all of this was planned in advance!

168
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,617
Eternal life!

169
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,123
This plot was in motion
a year before the asteroid was announced.

170
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,293
The gold management regulations
are already a mess.

171
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,795
I am deeply concerned

172
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,924
about the impact this situation will have
on the global economy in the future!

173
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,887
But don't forget, everyone.

174
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,055
I say we're stronger than gold.

175
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,933
We're stronger than gold!

176
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,685
We're stronger than gold!

177
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,811
Eternal life!

178
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,979
Eternal life!

179
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,983
When the asteroid hits,
eternal life begins!

180
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
Do not doubt.

181
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,280
Our future selves are waiting for us.

182
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,491
-Do not doubt.
-Man, what the heck?

183
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,660
-A new, inextinguishable sun burns.
-I thought he was onto something.

184
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,831
Though the asteroid might end the world

185
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,627
Walk toward the center of the light

186
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,130
You will find no death or extinction

187
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,467
The theory of promise is forever true

188
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,597
There's this woman I know.

189
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,266
She says she's pregnant.

190
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,563
And she's not sure
whether to keep the baby or not.

191
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,442
But if the baby's born now,
it won't make it to its first birthday.

192
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,360
Hey.

193
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,029
Who is this woman?

194
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,032
Is it Se-kyung?

195
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,327
It's not Se-kyung!

196
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,329
It's just

197
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,748
someone I know.

198
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,799
Meanwhile, here we are
just digging spinach!

199
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,762
And some bastards out there
are planning on escaping with gold.

200
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,389
Right?

201
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,267
I hope the gold bars are
a good sign for the new baby.

202
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,688
Those darn gold bars.
I wish I could just have a look at them.

203
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,442
Maybe we'll find some if we keep digging.
Is that never going to happen?

204
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,111
You're a greedy woman!

205
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,288
Se-kyung told me
to get you to sleep before leaving.

206
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,333
It's just as you said.

207
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,251
What?

208
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,671
Every day, I'm learning new sides
of Se-kyung I never knew about.

209
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,801
All the things I didn't know about her.

210
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,850
The way you see her is finally changing.

211
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,020
She's not just a cheerful girl, you know.

212
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,689
I didn't have to know all this.

213
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,816
If it wasn't for the end of the world,

214
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,736
you wouldn't have found out.

215
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,244
In a world like this…

216
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,540
do we all just end up becoming fools?

217
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,420
Se-kyung, me.

218
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,882
All of us.

219
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,675
The end of the world…

220
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,138
and the fool.

221
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,116
As you may know,

222
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,787
I'm a famous media figure

223
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,958
who spent many years
hosting an eponymous program

224
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,751
for an influential media outlet.

225
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,714
For your migration plan
to progress smoothly,

226
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,634
you need to turn
the public's eye elsewhere.

227
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,263
If you were to put me to good use…

228
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,891
Excuse me, ma'am.

229
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,267
Director? Chairwoman!

230
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,731
We don't want anyone's devotion.

231
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,151
Devote yourself to your family instead.

232
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,289
If they come with you voluntarily,
touched by your devotion,

233
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,417
then I'll reconsider.

234
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,672
That's not hard at all.
I'll come back with my family!

235
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,881
So you approve, right?

236
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,718
There was a slight hiccup,

237
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,472
but our migration plan
will go ahead as planned.

238
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,894
After completing payment for the plane,
we will board on the scheduled date.

239
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,897
I think you should show us proof.

240
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,486
I will give you proof
as long as you make a pledge of secrecy.

241
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,157
If this gets out,
the children may be in danger.

242
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,828
It could also provoke the public
and lead to a second riot.

243
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,835
-I'll make that pledge.
-Me too!

244
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,253
Yes, I pledge too!

245
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,254
So do I!

246
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,882
We…

247
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,137
will be flying
with the leaders and officials

248
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,431
of the shadow cabinet.

249
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,933
Here they are.

250
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,351
That's…

251
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,562
-Right?
-Yes!

252
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
Show us too!

253
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:47,983
In other words,

254
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,737
the entire process of our migration plan

255
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,741
is top secret
and is being meticulously supervised.

256
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,870
Code blue.

257
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,955
Surgical critical care unit, second floor.

258
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,165
Doctor.

259
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,333
Make way.

260
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,168
Code blue.

261
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,837
Surgical critical care unit, second floor.

262
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,014
Manager Im died while receiving treatment.

263
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,726
One, two, three.

264
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,353
One, two, three.

265
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,855
Nurse Kim, bring me the LUCAS.

266
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,023
Yes, Doctor.

267
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,866
What are you doing without notice?

268
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,496
All the children from the training center,
including Chae Young-han, are witnesses.

269
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,289
I'm following orders--

270
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,167
From whom? Who gave those orders?

271
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,503
You're just repeating the same words!

272
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,421
The JIU investigation is the priority.

273
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,339
But

274
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,385
I'm Young-han's family, so please.

275
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,512
Family visits are also not allowed.

276
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,305
"Not allowed"?

277
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,391
Under whose authority are you doing this?

278
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,935
No, Manager Im. From the training center.

279
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,688
He's dead!

280
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,159
Yeah.

281
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,744
Cardiac arrest?

282
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,080
Just as expected.

283
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,833
They have no creativity at all.

284
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,380
Those are for you. Eat up, okay?

285
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,470
Hey, pass me the ball!

286
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,432
-It's coming.
-Salute!

287
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,354
Good work.

288
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,986
-Get some rest.
-Yes, ma'am.

289
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,868
-Are you okay, ma'am?
-I'm fine.

290
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,495
Manager Im is dead.

291
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,875
Yes, Ms. Deputy Mayor.

292
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,544
They banned all visitations
for the children.

293
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,712
Yes, out of the blue.

294
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,049
-Yes.
-Hey.

295
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,056
Young-han meant to tell you this
during his counseling session.

296
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,852
It's about Father Baek.

297
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,063
Young-han saw him.

298
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,816
Young-han did?

299
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,527
He saw Father Baek?

300
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,156
-Yes.
-When? Where?

301
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:47,162
He went to the place where Father Baek was
a few times to perform.

302
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,874
The training center owns
several prayer houses.

303
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,587
The place Young-han went to
was probably one of them.

304
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,553
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER OPENS

305
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,767
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

306
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,567
ACCESSORY BUILDINGS - ADDRESS

307
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,196
Someone saw Father Baek…

308
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,242
at one of these addresses.

309
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,452
Let's go…

310
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,875
FATHER WOO SUNG-JAE
CAPTAIN KANG IN-A

311
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,463
Do not be deceived,

312
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,382
not by the wiles of someone
who hides in the--

313
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,926
Father!

314
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,013
Perhaps you should reconsider.
If this goes wrong…

315
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,140
I'll take responsibility, no matter what.

316
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,148
Did you hear that?

317
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,197
Why didn't you turn the lights on?

318
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,883
You should get some rest.

319
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,517
The more desperately I want you…

320
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,147
the more I seem to ruin things.

321
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,985
No.

322
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,989
It's my fault.

323
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,431
I should've thrown it out.

324
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,163
I found the real deal.

325
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,164
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

326
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,376
This is a safe organization
that prioritizes the value of family.

327
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,296
This time, it's for real.
I don't intend to drag you there.

328
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,631
Ha-yul.

329
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,009
I'll be good to you, okay?

330
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,846
I'll lead by example
so you can trust me and…

331
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,847
Yes.

332
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,724
I'll do this. How's this?

333
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,770
-What's up with this?
-The power's out.

334
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,189
-Huh?
-The power is out.

335
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,106
Really?

336
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,401
Okay, then.
Ha-yul, anything you want to eat?

337
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,820
I'll get you whatever you want. Like…

338
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,572
Seriously, what is wrong with him?

339
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,033
We've got instant noodles!

340
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,204
Packet or cup?

341
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,001
When a person changes too much,

342
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,045
it's creepy.

343
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,554
You know my younger brother,
Seok Tae in Pyongyang?

344
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,721
Yeah.

345
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,558
His family was dragged to Chŏngju
to mine for gold.

346
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,060
My other sibling in Dandong told me.

347
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,855
Pyongyang is a mess right now.
It's completely empty.

348
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,985
Everyone's been taken away to mine
for gold, zinc, and rare-earth elements.

349
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,697
They work 12-hour shifts
so all the rare minerals can be mined

350
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,448
before the asteroid hits.

351
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,535
It's just like the Chollima Movement.

352
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,328
Don't even talk about that stuff.

353
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,293
They're not being fed,
and I only get word that they are dying.

354
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,713
Hey, just eat up.
Don't think about anything else.

355
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,798
Okay? Eat your fill.

356
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,972
The engineering building is empty.

357
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,183
All the guys in the lab are…

358
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,060
They left.

359
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,022
I get to have the lab all to myself,
which is nice.

360
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,484
It's good to see you again.

361
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,488
For me…

362
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:02,162
it feels a bit awkward
to even ask how you've been.

363
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,710
So… why did you come back?

364
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,712
Why didn't you leave?

365
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,675
Young people are the useful ones.

366
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,304
Who'd want a withering old man like me?

367
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,850
-Professor.
-Yes, Gi-pyo.

368
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,270
I was able to get hold of the dissertation
you mentioned last time.

369
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,275
You should come with us
and see Yun-sang win the Nobel Prize.

370
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,028
There will be good news soon.

371
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,447
Dr. Ha.

372
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,784
The director of the lab
would really like to see you.

373
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,411
Stop by before you leave, okay?

374
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,958
Gi-pyo came looking for you
multiple times, right?

375
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,343
I don't know
what Gi-pyo has in store for you,

376
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,473
but, as for me, I feel bad for you.

377
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,726
At my age,

378
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:13,566
it doesn't seem like a bad idea
to witness the end of the world firsthand.

379
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,068
But

380
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,946
you're different.

381
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,452
Designing genetic variation
will be a key project in the safe zones.

382
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,830
You can't let it go to waste.

383
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,794
From what I heard,

384
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,254
apparently…

385
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,468
this will be the last opportunity
to get out of this country.

386
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,356
STATEMENT
NAME: NA HYEON-JAE

387
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,077
Fuck.

388
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,413
Hey.

389
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,499
Hey!

390
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,712
Hey, I heard you killed someone.

391
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,174
You're a murderer. A freakin' psychopath.

392
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,804
I can't sleep at night
because of you, you damn psychopath!

393
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,722
Kim Hyeon-sik.

394
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,433
Look at you!

395
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,061
I'm genuinely surprised
at the crap you just said.

396
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,688
Hyeon-sik.

397
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,649
You see, the real psychopath

398
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,318
is me.

399
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,652
Come here.

400
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,155
Come here. It's okay.
I'm not gonna bite you.

401
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,533
This is a great spot. A VIP seat.

402
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,660
Sit.

403
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,621
Cackle?

404
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,874
Why don't you give this bastard
a peck on the lips?

405
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,793
One, two, three!

406
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,378
Fuck!

407
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,132
Rip out his snout!

408
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,885
That idiot is dumber than a chicken.

409
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,263
Man, I'm tired.

410
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,932
-Ma'am!
-Hi.

411
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,767
Ma'am!

412
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,395
-Captain!
-Yeah?

413
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,481
Hey, guys! Hurry!

414
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,983
They laid eggs.

415
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,568
-They did it.
-They laid eggs.

416
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,906
Good job, Cackle!

417
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,956
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,542
You were only carrying out your mission.

419
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,877
Now focus on your duties here.

420
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,672
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's right!

421
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,257
You went through a lot.

422
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,967
-Hey, Ji-su.
-Yes, ma'am?

423
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,218
Take a break with him.

424
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,511
Come on.

425
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,267
And how would you know
that he went through a lot, Sergeant?

426
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,396
Bang!

427
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,649
Someone's been busy.

428
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,611
Ma'am.

429
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,490
Sergeant, the JIU is here looking for you.

430
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,413
-They're looking for her?
-Yes.

431
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,417
Please excuse me.

432
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,544
Ma'am.

433
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,216
Ma'am.

434
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,013
-Bye, ma'am.
-Ma'am.

435
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,309
-Understood, sir.
-This way.

436
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,187
-Does this go here?
-Yeah.

437
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,610
Hey, bring that one here.

438
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,611
Sir.

439
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,362
Is Capt. Kang getting canned?

440
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,781
Stop picking on the others and leave now.

441
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,450
I'll put you on the discharge list.

442
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:51,910
Sorry?

443
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,748
The disciplinary action isn't an issue.
It was internal anyway. I won't stop you.

444
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,878
Nothing but a load
of oxygen thieves here anyway.

445
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,795
Bunch of duds.

446
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,922
Shut it!

447
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,341
I'll leave now.

448
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,092
Check all the firearms.

449
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,179
Seize all the ammunition,
including that used for guard duty.

450
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,430
Yes, sir.

451
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,849
Hey, you don't want to mop?

452
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,935
Then get discharged, asshole!

453
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,771
Yeah, that mop smells like shit.

454
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,523
Fuck this shit!

455
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,859
That bastard's pissed off.

456
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,611
-He's pissed.
-Stupid morons.

457
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,196
Kim, you poor bastard.

458
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,449
-I have better places to be.
-Seriously, I want him gone.

459
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,910
-What's on the menu today?
-When is he going to leave?

460
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,954
Hey.

461
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,957
-First Sergeant Park, sir.
-What is it?

462
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,875
This is Sergeant Kim.

463
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,962
-I'm deleting this too.
-Everybody's busy talking about gold.

464
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,548
They don't even care that Capt. Kang
and Ms. Jin saved the kids.

465
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,969
Well, it's exciting news.

466
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,638
It wasn't a whole ton,
but it's still 500 kg of gold.

467
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,140
With that, any country would accept you.

468
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,477
Do we have to live like this
until the very end?

469
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,396
Deleting disgusting videos.

470
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,272
I'm so sick of this.

471
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,485
Yeah, the asteroid
will wipe all this stuff out anyway.

472
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,577
Gross!

473
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,419
It's a tragedy that I'm reminded of my dad
every time I do this.

474
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,962
I think I'm going crazy!

475
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,298
Now he wants to talk to us.

476
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,718
Whoa.

477
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,553
Is that even possible?

478
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,805
What do you think?

479
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,529
Father.

480
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,283
How did you come out of there?

481
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,869
Did you know about this passageway?

482
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,497
No, I just found out now.

483
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,291
The footage showed me.

484
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,220
The church extension funds
must be in those suitcases, right?

485
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,440
Where have I seen that driver before?

486
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,654
The man stood next to him is Manager Im,
the man who died of a heart attack.

487
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
Isn't this shocking?

488
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,755
I mean, where was Father Baek going
with all of that?

489
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,132
Abandoning us too?

490
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,843
You're glad, aren't you?

491
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,637
Father Baek might actually be alive.

492
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,434
Father,

493
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,437
can you send this to your phone?

494
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,315
It doesn't work on mine.

495
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,235
My phone's too old.
It won't work, no matter how hard I try.

496
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,946
So I was about to rip this out and--

497
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,532
Where are you trying to send this?
To whom?

498
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,659
Don't tell me you're…

499
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,953
Don't you worry.

500
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,459
I may talk a bit too freely sometimes,
but I'm not that thoughtless.

501
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,719
Give me your phone.

502
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,900
Dear Lord…

503
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,487
today,

504
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,992
I couldn't help but think of this quote
from the Book of Psalms

505
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,247
that Father Baek would often cite
and give us as topics for contemplation.

506
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,418
"Remember…

507
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,258
how frail…

508
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,933
the sons of man you have created."

509
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,536
-Why are you coming so late?
-I'm sorry!

510
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,038
-Oh no, we're late!
-Yun-sang!

511
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
Hi there!

512
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,709
Look here.

513
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,877
Say cheese! One, two, three!

514
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,131
Eat now.

515
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,717
Don't spill your food!

516
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,724
-Hey, that's mine.
-Get out of here!

517
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,977
-Don't do that.
-Seriously, Ji-eun!

518
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,562
Take this!

519
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,732
-Leave them be. They're in love.
-Having fun?

520
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,485
So you're not closing
the supermarket for good?

521
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,654
Of course not. We have Ji-eun here.

522
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,657
And Sister Gye Hyang over there
is about to bite the dust…

523
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,828
I mean, since her days are numbered,
she said she wanted to try something new.

524
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,663
But you're going to keep Moira open?

525
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,583
I love coming here
and listening to music once in a while.

526
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,879
Of course, madam!
Of course we'll keep it open.

527
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,090
But why isn't Sister Chae-hwan here yet?

528
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,509
Speaking of which,

529
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,846
why isn't our dear In-a here yet?

530
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,514
-Stop it.
-Hey.

531
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,434
Isn't In-a dating anyone these days?

532
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,186
-Zip it now!
-But why not?

533
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,855
Hey, Se-kyung! Yun-sang!

534
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,024
Listen, the two of you.

535
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,360
Go to the bishop
and have your nuptial Mass.

536
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,196
-That's right! Yeah!
-Yeah, do it already!

537
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,448
-Do it now!
-Do it now!

538
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,949
When will you do it?

539
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,368
I'm leaving soon!

540
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,119
Hey, wait.

541
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,040
-Take our picture. Do it now.
-Oh my!

542
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,626
-Take our picture. Do it now.
-Me too!

543
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,794
-Go away!
-Hey!

544
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,796
-This is our picture.
-Let's take it!

545
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,381
Smile and say cheese!

546
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,133
Cheese!

547
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,885
Yeah, this is great.

548
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,805
-Did it come out good? Not yet?
-We have to wait!

549
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,390
Right, next up,

550
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,768
a parting word from Mi-ryeong!

551
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,978
I hate you!

552
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,148
All right, then.
We'll hear two words from her!

553
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,567
Go on, say it.

554
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,238
This is so embarrassing.

555
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,739
Come on, now.

556
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,992
Please don't cry!

557
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,666
This country is about to go down,

558
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,586
and our end is drawing near anyway,
so why am I doing this?

559
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,842
I guess I just want to do something
I wouldn't usually do.

560
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,510
Gee, I don't know!

561
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,428
Come here.

562
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,764
-Hey, why me? What?
-Just…

563
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,017
So, ever since

564
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,105
we came to Woongcheon together,

565
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,776
we've been running Wondermart and Moira.

566
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,948
Well, as for Wondermart,
Ji-eun will take good care of it.

567
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,578
And I'm sure you'll all keep
cherishing Moira, right?

568
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
As for me,

569
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,042
since this man right here says
he'll stay by my side…

570
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,839
I really didn't want to cry.
What's wrong with me?

571
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,386
-I really didn't…
-Don't cry.

572
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,891
-Don't cry!
-Mi-ryeong!

573
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,059
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry!

574
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,396
Don't cry.

575
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,483
Myeong-ok, come here.

576
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,528
-Let me get a hug from you.
-Yeah.

577
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,655
Oh dear.

578
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,160
Don't go! Just don't!

579
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,953
Don't go.

580
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,831
Goodness, they're all crying.

581
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,083
-Stay healthy.
-I'm telling you not to go.

582
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,090
Hey!

583
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:54,178
Let's take a group picture
for the Woongcheon FCC, okay?

584
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,764
-Come here.
-Let's not cry, okay?

585
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,265
FFC. It's "FFC."

586
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,517
The camera is ready!

587
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,352
-FFC.
-Yeah, the F whatever.

588
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,604
-You have to come together.
-Gather around.

589
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,439
-Woongcheon FFC.
-Got a war cry?

590
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,359
Fine, then. Forever Woongcheon!

591
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,654
-Woongcheon!
-Woongcheon FFC!

592
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,324
This must be the last picture
we'll take together before we die.

593
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,371
Together to the end!

594
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:27,461
TOGETHER TO THE END!
D-154

595
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,733
You got discharged? Bastard!

596
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,569
Hey, when did you get here?

597
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,237
Wait. Get out of the way.

598
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,509
You haven't eaten, right? Let's eat.

599
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,303
Come here, kid.

600
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,847
Say hi. You'll be working together now.

601
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,266
Sit.

602
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,602
Sit down.

603
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,522
Forget the army chow. Let's eat real food.

604
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,983
You know Manager Jeong's boys, right?

605
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,818
You'll be in charge of them.

606
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:37,114
You said you'd hook me up with a broker
who would get me to the US.

607
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,035
Drink up.

608
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,621
Wait, what are you doing?

609
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,872
Wait just a second!

610
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,717
There is no gun.
He doesn't seem like the one.

611
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,219
Why do you keep looking for a gun on me?

612
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,512
This fucking sucks.

613
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,895
-Hyeon-sik.
-Sergeant Park.

614
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,148
Aren't these supposed to be sent
to the Special Missions Unit?

615
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,399
So Ju-yeon.

616
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,402
A soldier must do what they're told.
Keep your mouth shut.

617
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,030
-See? I told you.
-Hyeon-sik, take this.

618
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,157
God, I'm exhausted.

619
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,578
-Did you check that?
-Of course we did.

620
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,756
The ammunition we had hidden there
disappeared without a trace.

621
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,301
It wasn't you, and it wasn't So Ju-yeon.

622
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,264
Sucks for you, eh?

623
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,600
Well, it sucks for me too.

624
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,854
Of the boys who played
with the guns, one's dead,

625
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,898
one's gone missing,

626
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,983
and one's had a heart attack.

627
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,199
Anyway, be careful.
Things aren't looking good.

628
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,453
For whatever shady stuff they did,
they want us to lay low.

629
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,956
Fuck, we have to make a score somehow.

630
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,333
Hey, call Manager Jeong.

631
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,586
Hey, good job.

632
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,464
-Same food for the late-night snack?
-Yeah.

633
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,011
Hyeon-sik, the food's getting cold.
Hurry up and eat.

634
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,518
Man, you're one hopeless grunt,
wearing that uniform around.

635
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,104
We got big rooms up on the second floor.

636
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,188
Pick one and use it.

637
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,958
You look even uglier without your uniform.

638
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,377
Shut up.

639
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,587
What do you want?

640
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,466
I have to ask you something.

641
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,052
What? If I have a girlfriend?

642
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,680
Snap out of it, dude.

643
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:11,935
Well…

644
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:18,358
can you get me a gun
or something like that?

645
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,320
Hey. What are you talking about?

646
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,738
You were a soldier.

647
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,033
I'm sure you didn't leave empty-handed.

648
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,368
Not even the officers
can do stuff like that.

649
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:33,999
But instead…

650
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,713
Get over here.

651
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,261
What?

652
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,727
Give it some thought, okay?

653
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,071
Where did everyone go?
They didn't even eat their meals.

654
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:07,950
What is that?

655
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,620
Goodness, that little…

656
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,191
Father.

657
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:44,945
Father.

658
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,280
Father, open…

659
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,782
Father Woo Sung-jae.

660
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:53,912
-Let me.
-Okay.

661
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,334
Damn!

662
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,752
Hey, Sung-jae!

663
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,548
Fasting won't change anything!

664
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,680
You have new data in your head,
so come out and start utilizing it.

665
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,559
Are you praying again?

666
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,687
Does praying change anything?

667
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,942
Woo Sung-jae, open the door!

668
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,571
We should make a plan together!

669
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,577
Woo Sung-jae!

670
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,372
Open the door, Woo Sung-jae!

671
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,251
Sung-jae.

672
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,087
Sung-jae.

673
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,041
We have to find the link.

674
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,877
Like how Father Baek is connected

675
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,922
to those people.

676
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,885
As you know, my hands are tied right now.

677
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,513
If I do anything, I bet…

678
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:39,643
Just focus on feeding your soldiers.
Yun-sang, let me use your car.

679
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,228
Where are you going?

680
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,397
Yun-sang, I brought the director with me.

681
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,606
Dr. Ha.

682
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,070
I heard you came by a few times
but never once visited us.

683
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,571
How could you do that?

684
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,573
Well, I'm sorry.

685
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,742
He's not blaming you, okay?

686
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,705
Of course not.
Now's not the time to be nitpicky.

687
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,873
Dr. Ha.

688
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,210
I happened to get my hands on
a bottle of fine liquor.

689
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,962
Using this as an excuse,

690
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,549
I came to you first
to settle any bad feelings.

691
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,467
What do you say?

692
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,053
I'll come visit you at the lab.
Right now, Se-kyung is--

693
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,597
Right, she's welcome to join us too!

694
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,682
Yeah, how about it?

695
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,309
I'm really sorry, sir.

696
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,770
-Yun-sang!
-Dr. Ha!

697
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,313
Is he…

698
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,399
He still doesn't understand the situation.

699
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,901
The kid's too naive, you know.

700
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,903
Yeah, right. He's not naive.

701
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,613
Come on!

702
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,076
Se-kyung! Hey!

703
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,078
Kang In-a!

704
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,831
Se-kyung!

705
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,904
This is Ha Yun-sang.

706
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,672
Well…

707
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:43,850
Mr. Song.

708
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,197
Well…

709
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,627
Here. It's a bulletproof vest.

710
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,754
Put it on first.

711
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,299
I'm going solo this time for real.

712
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,138
What are you saying? Just put it on.

713
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,890
It'll only take a minute.
You don't even have bullets.

714
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,853
Soldiers have a duty to protect civilians.

715
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,275
I'm just going to check
and come right back.

716
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,489
Se-kyung.

717
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,327
Do you believe that finding Father Baek
will lead you to a solution?

718
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,913
I wish.

719
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,166
We all saw the video on the dashcam.

720
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,667
Father Baek ran away and--

721
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,836
No, he's still here.

722
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,758
Young-ji's little brother saw him
at some kind of country house.

723
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:00,760
What?

724
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,055
I thought there was nothing I could do

725
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,641
after the church had burned
and the money had vanished.

726
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,726
-But--
-Se-kyung.

727
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,729
In the end, we're all going to--

728
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,814
But there are things we can still do now.

729
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,149
If I find him,

730
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,861
I'll beg him if I have to.

731
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,778
Beg him?

732
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,867
To send the remaining kids to a safe zone?

733
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,039
You should all join me, then.

734
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,042
Yun-sang, Sung-jae, you.

735
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,252
Everyone.

736
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,008
Me alone won't be enough.

737
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,641
Don't worry. I'm just going to check
and come right back.

738
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,481
At least wear this while I can see you.

739
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,900
It's an older model, so it's a bit heavy.

740
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,527
But it's the least you can do
to reassure me.

741
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,196
Hurry.

742
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,783
I'm really busy right now,
but I'm putting this on for you.

743
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,867
Hey!

744
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,619
Waiting won't kill you.

745
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,704
-I put it on.
-But a bullet will.

746
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,623
Or an asteroid will?

747
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,167
Seriously, that mouth of yours.

748
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,462
Don't worry. I'll be back, okay?

749
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,017
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

750
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,019
-You promised. Okay?
-Yeah.

751
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,396
Yeah, I promise.

752
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,033
You're doing well for yourself.

753
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,453
All the other shops closed down
because they couldn't get the ingredients.

754
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,539
The nightclub managers provide it all.

755
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,874
Where do they get it?

756
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,875
Who knows?

757
00:54:56,626 --> 00:55:00,130
Heck, they charge me too much.
I might as well quit doing this.

758
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,552
They say the ration will be increasing,
so at least I won't starve to death.

759
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:13,893
Do you happen to know the managers here?

760
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,439
Everyone is a manager here.

761
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,691
Manager Lee, Manager Kim.
It's all bullshit.

762
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,777
Well, this guy doesn't work in this area.

763
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,697
He oversees the accounting
for an organization.

764
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,451
And it seems like
he's close to the people here. Wait.

765
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,911
This man is Manager Im.

766
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:32,996
I heard he died.

767
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,915
So you know him.

768
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,543
Whenever Father Baek visited,

769
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,421
he'd lecture Im
about becoming a better man.

770
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,256
Bae Jong-su, Manager Lee, Manager Im.

771
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,302
I don't get why those nightclub managers
tried to pay him off.

772
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,720
What were they hoping to get?

773
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,226
Sergeant.

774
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,025
-Please step out of the car.
-Sir!

775
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:03,860
Sir.

776
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,198
Well, well. Nice to see you here.

777
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,663
What's going on?

778
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,624
Huh?

779
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,169
I'm going on.

780
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,545
Will you be okay?

781
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,091
Yes, thank you. Can you leave now?

782
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,550
Sure.

783
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,263
You should close your window.
There are still mosquitos.

784
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,768
You know someone in the JIU?

785
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,190
He said to call if I needed help.

786
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,777
I can't let you meet him alone.

787
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,157
Close the window.
There are already mosquitoes in here.

788
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,784
Oh, okay.

789
00:56:59,165 --> 00:56:59,999
First,

790
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,962
we should ask him what happened.

791
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,006
See if he admits
to the things we already know.

792
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,345
Take care.

793
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,019
And I'm driving.
