1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,009
"It is acceptable

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,264
for the owner of an empty supermarket
to carry a gun and protect it."

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,559
In this kind of world,

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,186
law and common sense
aren't what's important.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,190
It's about how you enjoy your life.

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,862
But is this a world

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,032
that's worth living in?

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,540
So what you're saying is,
since the asteroid's gonna kill us anyway…

9
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,669
it'd be better to just do it ourselves?

10
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:50,717
When the asteroid hits,
those scumbags will die with us,

11
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,635
and I can't stand that.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,641
We can't let the asteroid
take away our chance, you know.

13
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,643
No, we can't. No way.

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,230
Drink this.

15
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,858
Slow down. You're scaring me!

16
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,373
Bae Jong-su.

17
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,878
It wasn't me.

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,342
It was you, wasn't it?

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:07,335

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,464
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,507
Good morning!

35
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,844
You're out of food. Wait here--

36
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,763
Hey, I just

37
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,058
came to say good morning.

38
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,145
That's silly.

39
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,522
What are you on about?

40
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,654
Never mind!

41
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,073
Se-kyung!

42
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,658
Yeah?

43
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,121
I'm leaving. I'm going home.

44
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,403
When was this?

45
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,447
What is all this?

46
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,451
What's with all the pictures?

47
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,374
I wanted to archive our lives as data.

48
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,794
For the aliens to see?

49
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,171
That's right.

50
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,592
Wait, does that mean stuff like our fights
and breakups will be in it too?

51
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,636
I won't put stuff like that in.

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,888
I'll take your word for it.

53
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,893
I was looking at
my old research materials,

54
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,147
and I didn't want my work
to be the only thing I left behind.

55
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,402
Off to city hall?

56
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,820
-Yeah.
-I'll drive you.

57
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,946
Are you heading out?

58
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,990
I'm meeting Prof. No.

59
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,912
In the US, I would listen to this
every day while thinking of you.

60
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,540
I found this track still in my files.

61
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,460
So I downloaded it.

62
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,213
-I did good, right?
-Yeah.

63
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,519
Yun-sang.

64
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,604
Yeah?

65
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,774
They want you back, don't they?

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,401
What do you mean?

67
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,944
The lab.

68
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,698
Go and save yourself.

69
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,993
They're offering you a chance.

70
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,204
There's no reason to refuse.

71
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,623
-Se-kyung, that's--
-Let's…

72
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,585
Let's talk later.

73
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,546
No, the thing is…

74
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,091
Thanks for the ride. I'll get going.

75
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,260
Bye.

76
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,637
Se-kyung…

77
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,599
Bye.

78
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,937
Okay.

79
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,616
It's done. It's over with.

80
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,202
Get it together, Se-kyung, okay?

81
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,287
We had nothing to do with it.

82
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,707
Under no circumstances
should an army officer and a teacher

83
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,877
be involved with those kinds of people.
Do you understand?

84
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,033
Mornin'.

85
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,368
Sister.

86
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,662
What?

87
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,707
When was the last time we saw Father Baek?

88
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,838
The night he was arrested by the soldiers
and came back unscathed,

89
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,467
I saw him heading into this hall
to pray by himself like you just did.

90
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,640
The administrator stopped
coming to work that day.

91
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,808
So I think

92
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,395
they both disappeared of their own accord.

93
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,481
They might be hiding out somewhere.
That is my assumption.

94
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,649
No, not assumptions.

95
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,487
Just tell me the facts.

96
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,782
Someone's being uptight.

97
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,203
Anyway, I've told you everything I know.

98
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,913
I really have.

99
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,589
They are all signed,
so you can give them out.

100
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,969
JEONG SU-GEUN

101
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,682
I heard you don't just deal
with floating bunkers here.

102
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,937
You offer special consultations for people
with the right qualifications, right?

103
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,565
About escaping.

104
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,402
So you know.

105
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,946
Escaping isn't the important part.

106
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,198
Escape is a given.

107
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,161
But the big shots want to be
big shots over there too, you know?

108
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,747
So the cabinet is all going to leave Korea

109
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,666
right before the asteroid hits.

110
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,002
Here.

111
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,091
The global capital wants to utilize
Korea's technology and resourcefulness

112
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,843
and make investments
in other parts of the world.

113
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,097
So these big shots are waiting
for the right moment, okay?

114
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,183
I smiled too broadly here.

115
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,110
You have to weigh it on a scale
before you mix it in the water.

116
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,905
The recipe says 500 grams of curry powder.

117
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,700
Girl, my hands are the scales.

118
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,078
-It's been ages since I had a full meal.
-Is the meat cooked?

119
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,247
Yes. It smells good, doesn't it?

120
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,416
-We're finally having meat.
-Yay!

121
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:56,632
Once again, thanks to Ms. Kim,
we are making our daily bread today.

122
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,384
-Thank you, ma'am.
-I know.

123
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,053
Everyone was so down
after the church caught fire.

124
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,891
Remember what the voice
from the speaker said?

125
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,520
About the account
where the money was sent.

126
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,233
I heard it belonged
to some kind of company.

127
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,401
Is it famous?

128
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,948
You're burning the meat.

129
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:21,907
Right.

130
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,202
The meat smells amazing.

131
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,168
A priest wouldn't suspect a fellow priest.

132
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,839
If there was a tournament
to pick the most indecisive person,

133
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,048
I'd be the winner.

134
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,345
Such a tournament would never take place

135
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,391
as indecisive people wouldn't even
be able to decide whether to apply or not.

136
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,562
I'm so frustrated with myself.

137
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,065
Sung-jae.

138
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,281
Know what my research was on?

139
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,078
I studied genetic variations,

140
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:13,751
and it was on how to fix genetic defects
at the embryonic stage.

141
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,837
People who survive
would be interested in that.

142
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,508
You want to go.

143
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,052
To the US.

144
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,560
I want to finish what I started.

145
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,023
Is this about Se-kyung?

146
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,090
SURVIVOR COUNSELING REPORT

147
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,888
I was with my family
when I entered the facility, but…

148
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,307
I was sent there from the facility…

149
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,520
I'm not sure what happened
after I entered the training center.

150
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,315
I TRIED TO ESCAPE BUT COULDN'T
BECAUSE THE MANAGERS KEPT A CLOSE WATCH

151
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,826
TRAINING CENTER MANAGER IM

152
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,293
The number you have called does not exist.

153
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,589
What is this training center?

154
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,345
-Hello.
-Hello.

155
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,930
-Hello.
-Hi.

156
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,640
Come in.

157
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,268
-Let's go in.
-It's a kitty!

158
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,021
-Tae-mi.
-Tae-mi!

159
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,693
Tae-mi.

160
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,863
People have been taking
cats and dogs lately.

161
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,282
-Let me.
-I thought they were all gonna get eaten.

162
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,867
Young-ji.

163
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,619
Can we feed this to Tae-mi?

164
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,206
We found a couple of cans left
at the supermarket.

165
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,791
They haven't expired yet.

166
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,170
Yeah, she's never had this one before,
but I think it'll be okay.

167
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,383
I have Tae-mi in my arms.

168
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,301
-Thanks. You can leave it there.
-Okay.

169
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,554
I heard you've lived in this apartment
for a long time.

170
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:13,973
Yeah.

171
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,143
I went to high school and university
outside Woongcheon.

172
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,522
I met Ms. Jin for the first time
when I came back.

173
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,399
I was never home, not even on weekends.

174
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,277
I guess you did really well in school.
You went to a good university, right?

175
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,781
I just chose the one
that had the best dorms.

176
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,451
That's what people
with good grades always say.

177
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,497
You had choices.
That means you had good grades.

178
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,415
True.

179
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,001
Young-ji.

180
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,795
Is the boy in this picture
your little brother?

181
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
Yeah.

182
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,679
You two look alike.

183
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,348
Your dad's face is…

184
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,060
Is your family…

185
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,937
No, they're all alive.

186
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,481
They're just somewhere else.

187
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,817
Hey, he looks familiar.

188
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,199
Chae Young-han.

189
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,536
He went to an alternative school
after the first term of our first year.

190
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,954
You know Young-han?

191
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
-The one who escaped school!
-I remember him.

192
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,376
He played an instrument very well.
Was it the cello?

193
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,211
That's right.

194
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,629
Where did the kids go?

195
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,798
-She's following us.
-Hae-chan. Woo-chan.

196
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,677
We're with the cat.

197
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,262
She's staring at us.

198
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,893
Young-ji.

199
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,146
Where is Young-han right now?

200
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,025
With our mom. He's…

201
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,740
Anyway, it's nice to meet you all.
Thanks for remembering my brother.

202
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,366
Before Young-han left school,

203
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,369
he told me to come to this training center
during summer break.

204
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,996
He even gave me a pamphlet.

205
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,083
Well, my dad said no, so I couldn't go.

206
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,421
Young-han, let's go home together.

207
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,425
Mom will go mad if we both disappear.

208
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,594
She might do something crazy.

209
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,681
I'll get out of here first.

210
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,976
Mom won't suspect you.

211
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,644
You're doing well.

212
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,983
I'll find people who can save us
and come for you right away.

213
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,651
You still have your phone, right?

214
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,404
Yeah.

215
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,377
Where is this place?

216
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,759
Hello?

217
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,971
Yeah, I'm on my way.

218
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,849
What?

219
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,102
What do you mean, today won't work?

220
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,479
I'm almost there!

221
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,318
Well, I'm at…

222
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,862
Yeah, I'm nearly there.

223
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,780
Tomorrow?

224
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,657
She'll see me tomorrow?

225
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,827
How would I know what your dad's thinking?

226
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,787
Not that I want to.

227
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,998
What if he causes trouble again?

228
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,793
If he causes trouble?

229
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,964
I'll be the one to leave this time.

230
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah, right.

231
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,848
I'm scared when he's in my sight

232
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,517
and when he's out of sight.

233
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,982
I'm craving crazy hot tteokbokki.

234
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,651
The glory of eternal life

235
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,571
It brims within my heart

236
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,533
O, eternal life
We shout with all our might

237
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,371
Let us sing our praise
For a new world

238
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,206
Eternal life is science!

239
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,165
Eternal life!

240
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,285
Mom.

241
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,080
What if the asteroid doesn't come?

242
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,541
What?

243
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,712
I mean, it might just go away
like how it appeared out of nowhere.

244
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,986
I want to live at our home
with Mom, Woo-chan, and Ga-eul.

245
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,907
Woo-chan worked hard on jumping rope.

246
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,744
Now we can easily go up to the 24th floor.

247
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,084
When will Mom and Ga-eul come back?

248
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,254
I miss them.

249
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,183
When Asteroid Dina hits,

250
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,603
pretty much everyone will die.

251
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,065
They will all die anyway.

252
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,360
Comrades.

253
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,695
Another day has gone by.

254
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,199
What can we do with the time we have left?

255
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,955
The arson at the church
and the disappearance of the funds.

256
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,543
Don't you wonder if the two are connected
by causality or correlation?

257
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,506
Will the truth ever be revealed?

258
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,132
Hyeon-jae!

259
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,967
Yes, sir.

260
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,804
It's hot today, huh?
Want me to get you some water?

261
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,888
I'm fine, sir.

262
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,392
Don't you find these chickens funny?

263
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,436
I don't know if they planned this,
but before we knew it,

264
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,064
they started living here anyway.

265
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,069
When I look at them,

266
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,823
I feel like everything's going to be okay.

267
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,283
All you gotta do is…

268
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,995
eat well and keep moving.

269
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,624
The chickens are…

270
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,252
It's fine. They love chili peppers.

271
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,629
Is it okay to feed them spicy food?

272
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,464
Apparently,
chickens can't taste spiciness.

273
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,969
That's why Bok-sun feeds her chickens
water with gochujang to provide energy.

274
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:49,970
Bok-sun?

275
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,556
From the cartoon.

276
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:12,868
Hello?

277
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,038
Hello?

278
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,877
Young-han, is that you?

279
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,546
Young-han.

280
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,632
Young-han!

281
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,845
Chae Young-ji.

282
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,813
Quit wandering around and come back.

283
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,941
Please…

284
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,238
please send Young-han to me.

285
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,284
Don't keep him locked up
in that crazy place!

286
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,664
I'm busy. Goodbye, now.

287
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,721
Tae-mi--

288
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,643
Young-ji, are you okay? Are you sick?

289
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,980
My little brother called…

290
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,983
-Is something wrong?
-No, I…

291
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,487
I didn't want to cry
until I could rescue him.

292
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:21,997
Ms. Jin!

293
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,667
Help Young-ji.

294
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,590
What's wrong? What is it?

295
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,217
Sit down. You're okay.

296
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,679
Why? What's wrong?

297
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,847
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

298
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,601
Young-han called from the training center.

299
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,687
-Please calm down.
-He couldn't say a word, and I tried to…

300
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,732
What did you just say?
The training center?

301
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,612
-My little brother called--
-Your brother's at a training center?

302
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,200
Were you at this training center too?

303
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,244
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

304
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,623
Tell me more.
Tell me more about this training center.

305
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:18,470
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

306
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,309
In-a.

307
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,648
Do you know about the training center
Chae Young-ji was at?

308
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,565
What?

309
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,318
Three of the girls
who were rescued during the mop-up

310
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,279
said they were from a facility.

311
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,115
I thought they were talking about
a children's home.

312
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,118
But there's more to it.

313
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:47,082
I was too distracted by the church fire,
so I couldn't think about anything.

314
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,250
I shouldn't have missed it. I just…

315
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,587
Please try to explain
in a way I can understand.

316
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,880
Just slow down, okay?

317
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,257
-Make yourself clear.
-Okay.

318
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,681
The girls I counseled,

319
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,433
those who were held captive
by Bae Jong-su and Lee Jae-min,

320
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,268
were initially at a facility

321
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,772
that grew by running
health and education businesses.

322
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,359
I think they're offering
to help people escape the country now.

323
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,486
That's why whole families
are joining them.

324
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,739
Once admitted,
they are separated by age and gender.

325
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,661
Some children escaped
because they couldn't stand it,

326
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,163
and then they fell into the hands
of those scumbags!

327
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,667
What if the place they were at
is the same place Young-ji came from?

328
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,461
You have to donate
all of your assets to be admitted.

329
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,466
That's the price for guaranteed migration
for the whole family.

330
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,556
I was with my family
when I entered the facility, but…

331
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,474
Young-ji had to escape too.

332
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,685
She even had to leave her brother behind!

333
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,020
No. You're…

334
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,773
you're imagining horrible things--

335
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,275
I'm not imagining this!

336
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,156
I mean, you're a military commander.

337
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,658
Sure, I get it.

338
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,495
I get that your unit doesn't have
any power right now, but still,

339
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,123
you can start an investigation, right?

340
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,001
Don't tell me there's nothing you can do.

341
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,920
Martial law gives you the power to!

342
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,551
I mean, what could have made her
run away in that state?

343
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,428
-What if you're wrong?
-What?

344
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,388
Looking into it on our own is one thing.

345
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,807
You can't just use martial law
whenever you want!

346
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,517
-What if I'm right?
-What?

347
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,019
What if I'm right?

348
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,896
I saw a name.

349
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,982
Among the names connected
to Bae Jong-su and Lee Jae-min,

350
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,568
there was this name.
"Training Center Manager Im."

351
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,738
In-a.

352
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,408
Please. Help me.

353
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,803
-No. I said no.
-Please!

354
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,304
-Go home. No.
-Just this once.

355
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,306
-No means no.
-Young-han is our friend.

356
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,224
We have to save him.

357
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,142
-Ms. Jin.
-I'm sorry.

358
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,729
Go home. Get home safe. Hurry up.

359
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,400
Bye.

360
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,629
You know you can't go in there anyway.

361
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,758
I just don't know what I should do.

362
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,760
I feel you.

363
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,096
I know you're worried.

364
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,730
I'll contact you when I get there.
But if you don't hear from me,

365
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,900
go to Capt. Kang.

366
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,868
Hey. I was about to head down.

367
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,455
-Where are you going?
-Can I get your car keys?

368
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,332
I'll drive you.

369
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,876
Don't worry. I'll drive safely.

370
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,505
My eyes will be on the road,
the rearview, and the side-view mirrors.

371
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:07,842
Jin Se-kyung.

372
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,177
Yeah?

373
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,264
You're lying, aren't you?

374
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,981
Come in for a minute.

375
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,493
Guys, hurry up.

376
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,838
What are you hiding from me?

377
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,132
No, it's not what you're thinking.

378
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,347
You're making me nervous, okay?

379
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,315
It's about work, I'm telling you.

380
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,363
This really sucks, you know,

381
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,992
that I have to interrogate you.

382
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,504
You saw what happened.
Ms. Jin got caught by Yun-sang.

383
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,548
So we're leaving her behind.

384
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,675
Then we're on our own?

385
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,051
This is what Young-han gave me.

386
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,136
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

387
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,805
He said with this,
I could visit him anytime.

388
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,266
Young-ji, how did you escape?

389
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,977
Her mom runs the place. She's the boss.

390
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,229
Still, we have to tell Ms. Jin before--

391
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,106
-Hey.
-It says right here.

392
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,275
"Training center for youth.
Always welcome."

393
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,111
We'll say that we want to be admitted,

394
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,697
and then escape with Young-han
using the secret passage.

395
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,093
This is Manager Im.

396
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,013
Manager Im. It's Young-ji.

397
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,413
I'm on my way there with Yun-sang.
Please help me.

398
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,085
Ma'am.

399
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,101
See if there's a training center
near Woongcheon Dam.

400
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,602
I'll take a look, ma'am.

401
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
I've located one training center.

402
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,031
It's called…

403
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,951
"Wooyang Training Center."

404
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,714
Guys!

405
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,618
Get discharged.

406
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,163
Don't do it.

407
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,748
Do it.

408
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,585
Don't do it.

409
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,337
Fuck.

410
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,006
Do it?

411
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,633
What the fuck?

412
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,052
He should be on chicken duty.

413
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,387
Fucking bullshit.

414
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,848
Hey!

415
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,435
Hey, you!
You're supposed to guard the chickens!

416
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,353
Go guard the chickens, asshole!

417
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,981
Hey! Guard the chick--

418
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,650
Fuck! What in the fuck…

419
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,945
Shoo!

420
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,709
What are you gonna do?

421
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,044
Well…

422
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,883
Se-kyung, Yun-sang, ride with me.

423
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,551
Let's go.

424
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,433
Are you really making a move?

425
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,893
Yeah, I confirmed it.

426
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,147
I'll send an accurate location
once I get there, so head that way.

427
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,857
Perhaps you should reconsider.

428
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,402
-If this goes wrong--
-I'll take responsibility, no matter what.

429
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,906
Yun-sang, get in.

430
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,991
Sure.

431
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,171
It's so big.

432
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,173
Hey, look at that. It's crazy!

433
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,426
Awesome. That's a training center?

434
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,347
Hey, why are you grabbing my hand?

435
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,599
Just let me hold it.

436
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,297
Welcome back, Ms. Chae.

437
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,727
Young-han's friends are here.

438
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,644
Okay.

439
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,438
Quite spacious, right?

440
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,064
She's here.

441
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,569
This is Mr. Jeong Su-geun.
I told you about him.

442
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,280
Have you taken a look around?

443
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:48,034
I could tell from the driveway.
This place is in a class of its own.

444
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:53,164
It must have cost a fortune
to build this place.

445
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,332
I'll show you around.

446
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,375
Please.

447
00:38:59,045 --> 00:38:59,879
Young-han.

448
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,796
Young-ji.

449
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,924
Hey, I'm Park Jin-seo. Do you remember me?

450
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,636
Hey, you've gotten taller.
We used to be the same height.

451
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,388
How have you been?

452
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,140
Good. How about you?

453
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,184
You look good.

454
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,480
The food must be really good here.

455
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,027
I'll show you guys around.
You'll like it here.

456
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,488
We can do that, right?

457
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,449
Follow me.

458
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,121
That's the secret passage
that Young-ji used to escape.

459
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,334
It gets dark faster in the mountains.
We have to hurry.

460
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:48,969
But…

461
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,389
Take good care of it.

462
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,766
Ammunition, clear.

463
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,029
Sorry, Yun-sang. Can you let go?

464
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,366
Se-kyung.

465
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,869
I'll go instead. This isn't right.

466
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,163
Hush now. I'm memorizing the route.

467
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,836
Plus, you stand out too much,
so it wouldn't work.

468
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,596
Se-kyung!

469
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,856
Please stay inside.

470
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,624
Here.

471
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,964
Se-kyung.

472
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,135
Come back if you can't find Young-han.

473
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,187
Support unit arriving in ten minutes.

474
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,024
This is Alpha.
On standby at the target location.

475
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,324
Once Lt. Kim gets here,
I'll go to the training center with her.

476
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,659
Stay alert and protect this civilian.

477
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,036
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,581
Don't worry too much.

479
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,125
Support is on the way.

480
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,608
Come, have a look.

481
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,113
The facilities here are just amazing.

482
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,741
-Right?
-I mean, a performance hall?

483
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,786
As they say, regardless of your trade,

484
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,372
you have to be able to play
an instrument, right?

485
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,667
That is a basic level of refinement.

486
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,293
Yes, of course.

487
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,881
He has a young daughter.

488
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,259
He might be useful.

489
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,269
That man's never gonna leave us.

490
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,564
Young-han,
I heard you play the cello well.

491
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,649
-Play for us.
-What?

492
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
Should I?

493
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,659
Can Young-han play the cello
for his friends?

494
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,417
And if you take that picture…

495
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,693
-What do we do?
-Young-ji?

496
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,500
Can I…

497
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,295
I want to see my mom.

498
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,297
Where is she?

499
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,777
Excuse me.

500
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,695
Not yet.

501
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,689
They were just here.

502
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:37,276
Check the control room right now
and see where the children went.

503
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,404
And close off the main locations.

504
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,253
Ma'am, practice has been suspended.

505
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,131
That'll be it for today.

506
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,231
All Wooyang family members in the center,
please gather at the main hall.

507
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,483
I repeat.

508
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,821
All Wooyang family members in the center,
please gather at the main hall.

509
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,744
It's okay.

510
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,332
Do you see that ladder?
Climb down the ladder.

511
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,875
Careful. Watch your step.

512
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,335
This is the secret passage?

513
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,045
Yeah, you have to be careful.

514
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,674
Watch your step.

515
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,848
CAN'T FIND YOUNG-HAN

516
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,933
NO SERVICE AREA

517
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:44,945
We must follow the principles
of the universe to return to our roots.

518
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,950
Even if the asteroid comes,
Earth will not be destroyed.

519
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,817
But all life on Earth will cease to exist.

520
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,694
-Yes, this way.
-Okay.

521
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:29,281
-You will safely board the ark.
-I'm getting no signal here.

522
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,741
Come on. This way.

523
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,576
We have to hurry.

524
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,249
Is something wrong?

525
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,460
You are standing
in the dominion of salvation.

526
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,171
No.

527
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,715
This is the safest place there is,

528
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,845
for it is where we prepare to leave
with the children that we love.

529
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,097
-Excuse me--
-Hey, come on!

530
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,016
What are you doing?

531
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,561
Am I not allowed to leave?

532
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,148
…where there is no death or pain,
we will find a land.

533
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,818
You're here for a consultation.
I thought you had a lot of questions.

534
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,197
-Take good care of him.
-Wait--

535
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,200
Let's continue your consultation.
Go on, take him.

536
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,117
That's it!

537
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,789
Get moving.

538
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,123
Yes, ma'am.

539
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,044
Get out there and find them!

540
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:38,809
LOVE, FAITH, SALVATION
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

541
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,394
You can't just barge in--

542
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,521
I'm Cpt. Kang In-a
of the Combat Support Company.

543
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,523
We're here for an investigation.

544
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,400
Damn it!

545
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,751
Martial law allows military commanders
to lead an investigation in an emergency.

546
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,130
-Move in.
-Yes, ma'am!

547
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,883
The day of judgment is coming.

548
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,055
The system of order on Earth
has been destroyed.

549
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,058
We must follow
the principles of the universe…

550
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,560
You have no right to be--

551
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,603
Who is that man on the screen?

552
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,063
I ask for your cooperation.

553
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,068
We may initiate an investigation
at our own discretion.

554
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,822
Noncompliance will be punished
by immediate execution.

555
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,701
If you find any minors,
report to me right away.

556
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,746
Bring everyone you find here.

557
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,663
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,457
You're going to take our children?

559
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,627
They are being protected
in the best facility there is!

560
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,254
-Start searching!
-Let's go!

561
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,172
Yes, ma'am!

562
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,049
Stop the soldiers.

563
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,634
Stop them!

564
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,512
Excuse me! Over here!

565
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,141
Kim A-jin's parents, are you here?

566
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,642
Kim A-jin's parents!

567
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,062
Let go! Kim A-jin's parents!

568
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,396
Yes, that's me.

569
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,774
Do you know where A-jin is?

570
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,526
Yes, she's in the meditation room.

571
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,195
It's 10 p.m.

572
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,696
She was rescued a while ago

573
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,699
from an adult entertainment business
in downtown Woongcheon.

574
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,828
She's currently receiving treatment
at a public health facility.

575
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,246
That's nonsense!

576
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,332
You're lying through your teeth!

577
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,334
Who is that man on the screen?

578
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,086
I'd like to see him now.

579
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,087
How dare you!

580
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,548
He is the one
who offers us guidance from afar!

581
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,929
You don't even know where he is,

582
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,431
yet you entrust him
with the safety of your children?

583
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,600
Start searching!

584
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,268
Yes, ma'am!

585
00:51:54,861 --> 00:52:01,201
Before that day arrives, we must make
thorough preparations and be ready.

586
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,954
Now let us all pray together.

587
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,086
Shit!

588
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,390
-That's gold.
-Let's go!

589
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,977
Let's go. Hurry!

590
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,733
Ms. Deputy Mayor. For now,
I'll bring the kids who want to leave

591
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,486
and those who are without a guardian.

592
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,990
Yes, please make those preparations.

593
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,246
Can't we do anything about the other kids?

594
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,292
Their parents are here.

595
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,088
They offered up everything they had
in hopes of leaving this country.

596
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,174
What can we do?

597
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,223
Let me quickly go and relieve myself.

598
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay.

599
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,823
You must stay in the car!

600
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:23,867
Kids.

601
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,119
Young-ji.

602
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,123
Guys, get in the car! Quickly!

603
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:36,630
Se-kyung.

604
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,466
Se-kyung.

605
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,476
Who are you?

606
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,731
Who are you?

607
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,401
-Put down the gun, or I'll open fire!
-Who the hell are you?

608
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,370
Everyone is on board.

609
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,416
Escort the transport vehicle.

610
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,001
Check on the gunfire.

611
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,419
Yes, ma'am.
