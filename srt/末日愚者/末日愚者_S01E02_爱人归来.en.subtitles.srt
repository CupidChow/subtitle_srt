FLOATING BUNKER PRESENTATION

13
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,431
Yun-sang.

14
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,601
I'm heading down for some coffee.

15
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,541
Ms. Jin.

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,542
DO NOT ENTER

17
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,793
No one lives there.

18
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,634
I'm only half awake.

19
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,138
I smelled coffee in my dream, so…

20
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,560
That's right. No one's here.

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,061
-Right.
-Ms. Jin.

22
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,729
Well,

23
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,649
Bae Jong-su is dead.

24
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,758
Delivering news to fellow comrades
as the end draws near,

25
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,427
this is Pirate Radio!

26
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,431
Here's today's first news
that I, Oktokki, have gathered.

27
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,349
The guy who broke out of prison

28
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,768
and committed the unspeakable
against children,

29
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,438
that bastard Bae Jong-su, is dead.

30
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,943
According to the Joint Investigation Unit,
he put a bullet through his own eye.

31
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,865
Whether he did it to himself,
or it was someone else, we can't be sure.

32
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,036
When that bunch of scumbags
were roaming the streets freely,

33
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,205
the JIU didn't even bat an eye, then boom!

34
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,541
Down comes divine punishment!

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,752
Are you all done? Let's go.

36
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,009
Hold on.

37
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:38,927
Let me see it.

38
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,901
Those scoundrels broke out of prison
amid chaos, kidnapped and sold students,

39
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,654
and left the rest of them
to die in a container.

40
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,489
Another well-deserved end.

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,491
-This is so good.
-Doesn't this feel great?

42
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,576
I don't care how he died.

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,828
What matters is that our enemy is dead.

44
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,665
The asteroid will crash into Earth
in 200 days.

45
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,916
MIN-HO, SO-MIN
HA-YUL, JIN-SEO

46
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,794
Even if you get to the safety zone,
there's no guarantee you'll survive.

47
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,128
Yeah, we all know that.

48
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,798
It pisses me off
that we live in fear of those jerks!

49
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,009
I hope someone would get rid of
the rest of the gang too.

50
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,761
If only I had a gun!

51
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,930
Here comes the punisher!

52
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,307
When asteroid Dina hits,
almost everyone will die.

53
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,225
BAE JONG-SU

54
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,186
-Gross.
-So they will die anyway.

55
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,650
DELETING

56
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,948
Saved up some money?
Your monthly maintenance is due.

57
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,032
KANG EUN-JIN, 3RD GRADE

58
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,492
We're still a little short.

59
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,121
Bae Jong-su might be dead,
but we'll never live in peace.

60
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,456
Maybe we should beg her again.

61
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
I'll butter them up or something.

62
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,253
One, two, three, four.

63
00:04:55,336 --> 00:05:01,342
Born as a valiant son of this nation

64
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,760
Okay, sir.

65
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,057
Hey. They said it was suicide.

66
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,602
He couldn't have shot himself
at that angle.

67
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
The JIU doesn't do its job properly.

68
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,607
They don't care about
some dead jailbreaker.

69
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,397
But why? Tell me why!

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,564
For God's sake!

71
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,734
Sir, please calm down. I'll explain.

72
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,989
As you know, every country has
different conditions for migration.

73
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,076
In the case of the US,
where you were trying to go,

74
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,080
it's part of the International Convention
on Personal Data Sharing. Look.

75
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,499
Those who broke the Youth Protection Act--

76
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,501
Why the hell am I on that list?

77
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:03,089
Maybe you were caught visiting
a business that hired underage workers?

78
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,006
Right.

79
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,095
So your personal and medical records
are all shared between them.

80
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,931
For some countries…
Mr. Jeong, where are you going?

81
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:16,394
You'll need to prove that you have
COVID antibodies and that you're STD-free…

82
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,271
What an asshole.

83
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,189
I feel for his wife and child.

84
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,903
Kid, we have a manager
waiting for that maintenance fee, okay?

85
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,572
That's a terabyte of Korean films.

86
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,408
What the fuck is this?
Some ancient artifact?

87
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,078
I'll pay the rest as soon as the one
I'm working on gets sold.

88
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,288
How do I trust you?

89
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,375
If you think you're off the hook
just because a middleman died…

90
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,793
Just bring the chicks, then.

91
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,546
-Let's have fun together.
-What?

92
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,424
Was it Ha-yul?
Leave her out. Her dad's a wacko.

93
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,092
That girl So-min.

94
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,553
Her mom is scarier though.

95
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,975
Just do as you're told.
I didn't ask for your opinion.

96
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,311
Do not doubt.

97
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,647
Our future selves are waiting for us.

98
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,316
Do not doubt!

99
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,527
A new, inextinguishable sun is burning.

100
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,863
-Eternal life!
-Eternal life!

101
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,948
The asteroid collision is a lie.

102
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,701
The asteroid is fake.

103
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,745
Don't be swayed, everyone.

104
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,831
The asteroid collision
is the beginning of eternal life.

105
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,751
It is a new beginning. Everyone.

106
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,044
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,671
-Are you here alone?
-No.

108
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,926
Don't wander around. Get going!

109
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,843
Okay.

110
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,472
Do not doubt!

111
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,973
Do not doubt!

112
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
Do not doubt!

113
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,437
Even if the asteroid hits Earth,
it doesn't mean we will cease to exist.

114
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,940
An organism can't be
completely exterminated.

115
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,025
This is not a delusion.
I'll tell you why--

116
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,360
My God, sir.

117
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
Please stop. It's boiling today.

118
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
Believe in Jesus.

119
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,076
-A new sun burns.
-Eternal life is not a religion.

120
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,993
Eternal life!

121
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,496
-Eternal life is not a religion.
-Eternal life!

122
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,582
MISS YOU
WE LOVE YOU

123
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,750
So-min.

124
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,585
How did it go?

125
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,088
What did the collectors say?
Did they threaten you?

126
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,758
Same as usual.
They told me to stick to the pay schedule.

127
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,010
You should write something too. Here.

128
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,345
What should I write?

129
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,429
It's D-200 today.

130
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,686
I'M SURE IT'S NICER THERE

131
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,191
All right. Hold on.

132
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,485
Ha-yul, what is it?

133
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,029
Why should we be the only ones
to tell you our secrets?

134
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,739
You should tell us yours too.

135
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,575
She's right!

136
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,287
Something the principal
should never find out.

137
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,122
Just one, please?

138
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,957
Wait.

139
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,960
The principal is my boss at work.

140
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,630
It's too risky. It'll be too sad
if we can't see each other, right?

141
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,550
So, no. Sit down.
Open your books now! Everyone!

142
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,219
-Tell us one!
-Come on, guys!

143
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,387
Tell us one!

144
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,558
Tell us one!

145
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,143
Tell us one!

146
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,227
Draw the curtains!

147
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,771
No class today. We'll skip it!

148
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,109
So you want my secret?

149
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,237
My secret is…

150
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,370
Keep it down, all right?

151
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,955
Just look.

152
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
What is that?

153
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,548
Be quiet. Everybody, quiet!

154
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,760
Do you like butterflies?

155
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,094
Ms. Jin, why butterflies?

156
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,929
She has three butterflies!

157
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,973
I want to get a tattoo too.

158
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,353
Okay. Back to your seats.

159
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,815
You little rascals.
You just want to slack off, don't you?

160
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,733
Sit down.

161
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,323
Now, as I just shared my secret,
I'll make an announcement.

162
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,117
-I'm going to start a soccer club.
-What?

163
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,702
Why?

164
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,204
Any applicants?

165
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,455
-Me!
-Me!

166
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,623
I'll be the manager!

167
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll be the super pretty head cheerleader.

168
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,878
-I'll be the goalie!
-Min-ho!

169
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,254
A lot of you are interested.

170
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,758
-I want to be on the cheer team.
-I guess we'll have a tryout, then.

171
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,093
Open your books.

172
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,846
You little rascals!

173
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,185
-Eternal life!
-Eternal life!

174
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,021
-Do not doubt!
-Do not doubt!

175
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,106
Ms. Jin!

176
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,109
-Yes.
-The deputy mayor is looking for you.

177
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,026
Okay.

178
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,634
It was chaotic early this morning.
Do you all know?

179
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,554
Soldiers swarmed in here.
My daughter, Capt. Kang, as well.

180
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,473
I heard it was a suicide.

181
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,725
But they weren't sure.

182
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,771
It's next door to the house
you're working at.

183
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,731
I know nothing about him.

184
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,902
I just saw some cars parked there
on my way to work. That's all.

185
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,030
Goodness, why would anyone
living in such a fancy house do that?

186
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,033
Those houses even have private bunkers.

187
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,285
I heard they keep you safe
from nuclear bombs.

188
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,787
That's right. Mister!

189
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,704
Yes?

190
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,289
You should know about it.

191
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,959
You drove the mixer truck
when those houses were built.

192
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,044
Those bunkers are sturdy for sure.

193
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,214
We dug ten meters into the ground

194
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,800
and covered it
with a two-meter-thick ceiling.

195
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,137
Where I work, she stocked up
all sorts of stuff in there.

196
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,475
It's probably enough for her
to last three years with her grandson.

197
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,018
Meaningless, that.

198
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,937
It'll all be sunk underwater anyway.

199
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,442
Even those new apartments
will also end up as fancy fish tanks.

200
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,403
I guess you're right.

201
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,073
But we'll probably all burn to death
before the flood hits.

202
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,492
Now that we're done
with the young summer radish,

203
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,704
we should plant napa cabbages
and ponytail radishes for kimchi.

204
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,249
Once we are done making kimchi
to last until next spring,

205
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,084
that will be it for the world.

206
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,838
I won't have to make doenjang
and soy sauce anymore.

207
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,092
It's really sinking in
now that you say it like that.

208
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,386
It really is.

209
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,103
It's going to rain.

210
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:11,911
WOONGCHEON CITY
SHELTER NO. 3 CONSTRUCTION SITE

211
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,671
There is still some water on the railroad.

212
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,093
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

213
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,846
We need to walk down to the very end.

214
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,765
-Over there.
-Right.

215
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,687
Section One, Section Two.
They're already switched on.

216
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,536
What's with that look?

217
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,038
Sorry?

218
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,460
Stop zoning out and give me
an estimation of this shelter.

219
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,463
Are you asking me for an estimation?

220
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,302
Well, who else? You used to teach
technology and home economics.

221
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,724
But now I'm just a volunteer
in charge of children and youths.

222
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,977
And as for the shelters,

223
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,813
I already told you
they're just a mockery for the people.

224
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,148
I know that, okay?

225
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,528
It's absurd that the government
came up with this as a safety measure.

226
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,408
Still, we should at least get a budget
and do something.

227
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,578
Would you rather sit and watch
people getting tricked and scammed

228
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,747
by private bunker companies and cults?

229
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,543
But you know
that no place will be safe in the end.

230
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,965
-Se-kyung.
-Yes?

231
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,050
Let's just… you know.

232
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,639
Let's just pretend
we're building a huge dance hall.

233
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,558
That sounds good.

234
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,477
An end-of-the-world dance party
with the kids. Is that it?

235
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,854
That's it.

236
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,277
Jin Se-kyung.

237
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,281
A dance party!

238
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,284
How about this?

239
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,245
-A dance party!
-You've got some moves!

240
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,083
This is how I used to be,
silly and cheerful.

241
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,336
Hey, I used to be a rational
and reasonable per--

242
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,588
Oh my God!

243
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,799
Capt. Kang?

244
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,010
What's up? Are you here for me?

245
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,472
Or me?

246
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,141
Yeah.

247
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,398
So many people are still missing.
We don't even know if they're alive.

248
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,694
Now only a few people visit this place.

249
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,240
This whole square
used to be crowded, remember?

250
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,829
I guess we're all exhausted.

251
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,132
I'm just gonna say it.

252
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,219
Bae Jong-su, the guy who died.

253
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,889
He was a total scumbag.

254
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,354
Jailbreakers, fake soldiers,
and low-life gangsters.

255
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,069
Under the special law,
they should be executed.

256
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,029
But there is a pattern.

257
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,326
Disguised suicide.

258
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,584
A warning to the remaining gangs.

259
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,877
So it was a punishment.

260
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,379
No.

261
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,884
No matter the reason,
personal revenge is not punishment.

262
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,053
It's a crime.

263
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,059
-If anyone investigated this properly--
-Who is that "anyone"?

264
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,479
Because the JIU would never do its job.

265
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,648
You're right.

266
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,818
And I can't.

267
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,238
A supporting unit has no authority.

268
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,158
But if I were to investigate…

269
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,412
you'd be the prime suspect.

270
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,545
I didn't do anything.

271
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,049
-Why?
-You held a grudge against him.

272
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,135
Who didn't?

273
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,638
If it was you--

274
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,015
You're delusional.

275
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,480
If it wasn't you, don't ever think about
doing something like that.

276
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,442
Sure.

277
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,328
I know things will never go
back to normal.

278
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,460
Still, we shouldn't commit crimes.

279
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:17,174
No matter what I say, you're still
going to have suspicions and worries.

280
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,010
-Say you didn't do it. I'll believe you.
-I didn't do it.

281
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,596
I really didn't.

282
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
I'll get going.

283
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,024
Forget what I said.

284
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,282
From now on, don't go around alone.

285
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,952
Don't be out at night.

286
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,370
But I work late all the time.

287
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,583
Do you…

288
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,089
do you know what those scumbags are like?

289
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,301
They are nasty,
powerful, filthy, and tenacious.

290
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,219
You…

291
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,848
Even if some punisher
takes out a few of them,

292
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,268
they will keep crawling out
and wreaking havoc.

293
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,271
They're sex-trafficking trash.

294
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,029
I'm gonna go.

295
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,483
302 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

296
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,160
The priest came first.

297
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,662
He's dancing like a clubber
in a priest's robes.

298
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,584
I didn't want to be late,
so I didn't have the time to change.

299
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,131
-We can't be late when Se-kyung calls.
-Of course not!

300
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,217
Yun-sang, are you allowed
to call us from the lab?

301
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,304
Do you think I have a choice?
I'm stuck in here all day.

302
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,185
These guys are practically my family.

303
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,189
What? They are so cute!

304
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,112
Oops. Have you ever counted a mouse's fur?

305
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,157
How many strands do you think there are
in a 5 mm square?

306
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,578
Are you working on some hair loss pills?
A special medicine for hair loss?

307
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,955
Ha Yun-sang.

308
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,709
Just leave everything there
and come back, all right?

309
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,462
Have your wedding with Se-kyung
and go back.

310
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,214
Out of sight, out of mind.

311
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,801
That's the only reason
long-distance couples break up.

312
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,094
Says a priest.

313
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:11,098
-Says a good-looking jerk.
-What do you know, Priest?

314
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,976
-Hey, look at me.
-By the way, guys.

315
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,146
-I got a special promotion. See this?
-Dance like me.

316
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,233
Kang In-a, bam!

317
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,611
About our wedding…

318
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,239
Yeah?

319
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,492
Hey, don't look too depressed.

320
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,828
Okay. Then…

321
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,790
let's get it done like it's a quest.

322
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,959
Father Baek's going to officiate, is he?

323
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,420
I hope I'm not bothering him.

324
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,214
You know how much he adores you.

325
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,605
I should go to bed now.

326
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,191
Can I see your match somehow?

327
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,945
In-a is going to record a video.
I'll send it as soon as the game is over.

328
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,120
WE HOPE YOU GROW UP WITH DREAMS
AND HAPPINESS IN YOUR LIVES!

329
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,205
2025 WOONGCHEON'S FRIENDLY SOCCER MATCH

330
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,623
One, two, three!

331
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,126
Let's go, Cheondong!

332
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,045
Let's go!

333
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,677
Woongcheon!

334
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,555
Unbeatable Team Cheondong

335
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,392
Run ahead at full speed

336
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,104
Win the day, Team Cheondong

337
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,272
Show us what you're…

338
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,317
Let's go!

339
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,238
Win it for us! Go!

340
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,449
Go, Cheondong!

341
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,534
Mi-ryeong, keep running! Run!

342
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,830
Let's go!

343
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,127
Come on, Mom!

344
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,546
It's okay. Min-ho, stand up.

345
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,508
Go, Cheondong!

346
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,598
What a shameless man.

347
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,934
Yun-sang would come back from the States.

348
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,851
What was that?

349
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,438
If Yun-sang found out you were here,
Gi-pyo, he'd come back from the States!

350
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,106
That would be great!

351
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,154
Press them!

352
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,156
Press them! Tackle from behind!

353
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,459
Are you okay?

354
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,877
It was a foul!

355
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,571
One more goal!

356
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,282
Hey! Don't go easy on them!

357
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,744
You all let them score. I saw it.

358
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,373
What are you talking about?
It was a clean goal!

359
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,457
Se-kyung.

360
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,876
I wasn't surprised
when you started playing soccer,

361
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,795
but I never expected you to make a team.

362
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,382
You'd understand if you taught kids.
You want them to try all the fun things.

363
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,011
-What's this?
-I bet it's Father Baek.

364
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,597
-Are you two pulling a prank?
-You didn't get anything?

365
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,098
-What is it?
-Why, what is it?

366
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,273
What is this?

367
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,442
-It's a prank, right?
-It must be a scam.

368
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,235
You got it too, right

369
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,697
I'm scared.

370
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,699
What is it? Are we playing or what?

371
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,118
Are you all tired out?

372
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,537
Mom, take care of my stuff.
I got an emergency call.

373
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,372
-Hey, In-a!
-In-a!

374
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,374
In-a!

375
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,752
What is this?

376
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,088
"A global announcement will be made
at midnight tonight"?

377
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,758
Ms. Joo, it looks like
Capt. Kang got an emergency call.

378
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,176
Just another Tuesday for her.

379
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,896
Shit. We're fucked!

380
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,398
Hae-chan, why aren't they playing?

381
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,400
Is it over?

382
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,318
No.

383
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,320
I don't know.

384
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,573
-Let's go.
-Okay.

385
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,689
ASTEROID COLLISION ON KOREAN PENINSULA
THE LAST 300 DAYS

386
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,078
Mom?

387
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,746
-Yes?
-I'm not getting any signal.

388
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,248
Cancel everything for tomorrow.

389
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,125
-Hello?
-What?

390
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,459
My phone has no reception.

391
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,377
Are you there?

392
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,303
What do we do, really?

393
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,973
-Hurry!
-Okay, I'm coming.

394
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,873
199 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

395
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,833
This is Deputy Mayor Im Seon-ju.

396
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,085
Where is the asteroid? I can't see it.

397
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,671
Conspiracies are taking advantage
of our anxieties,

398
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,506
and crimes such as looting, violence…

399
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,758
Hae-chan!

400
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,760
Hi!

401
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,094
SEONJIN STAFFING INC.

402
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:28,516
We declare that Woongcheon City will take
strong action against all crimes.

403
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,937
Dear Woongcheon citizens,

404
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,190
as of today,

405
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,443
the time we have left is 199 days.

406
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,489
-Time to drink water!
-The remaining time is so precious.

407
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,408
Oh boy. You like it, don't you?

408
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,077
Hello, birdie. Thirsty, aren't you?

409
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,749
We have to be there for one another
until the last moment.

410
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,463
-Thank you, all.
-Thank you!

411
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,093
I think these potatoes
and Spam are all we have left now.

412
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,179
Where are the sausages I brought?

413
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,891
Don't even get me started, sir.

414
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,478
Those three boxes of sausages
you took the trouble to get?

415
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,064
When I opened them up, it was just…

416
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,566
I didn't even have the guts to look.

417
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,236
The ice pack had melted,
so there was water everywhere,

418
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,154
and it smelled awful.

419
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,032
And those tiny bugs
that look like peanuts…

420
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,116
Enjoy your meal.

421
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,702
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

422
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,747
Seriously, what the fuck is this bullshit?

423
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,916
We work our asses off,
and this is what we get?

424
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,836
You know what, sir?
I even have guard duty after this.

425
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,838
We don't even get Spam anymore.

426
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,174
I might as well just take her on.

427
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,218
Come on, that's too much.

428
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,931
Hey, if I fought her, ranks aside,
I would waste her in five seconds.

429
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,433
-True that!
-Hyeon-sik.

430
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,438
No matter how messed up the military is,

431
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,233
we never tolerate insubordination,
all right?

432
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,572
Enjoy your meal, sir.

433
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,949
Ignore him, sir.

434
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,452
What do you say we have a little fun
with some money later?

435
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,162
It's collecting day, isn't it?

436
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,875
Well, there is at least something
to look forward to.

437
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,376
Later today, then, huh?

438
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,973
ETERNAL LIFE STUDIES

439
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,558
Man, I'm starving.

440
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:42,609
There are three features that distinguish
quantum physics from classical physics.

441
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,777
The first is quantized energy,

442
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,865
which means that elements like momentum
are determined by a certain value.

443
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,075
The second is wave-particle duality.

444
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,452
On a microscopic scale,

445
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,288
these two properties can be observed
at the same time.

446
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,666
The last is the uncertainty principle.

447
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,879
Some values cannot be measured accurately
at the same time.

448
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:06,382
So does that mean
our bodies will become quantum?

449
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,759
Exactly! Everyone.

450
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,969
Eternal life is not a delusion.

451
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,804
It's cutting-edge medical science.

452
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,390
I'm certain that, beyond the apocalypse,

453
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,311
there is another world created by waves
that have accumulated thus far.

454
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,771
Eternal life!

455
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,693
Gross.

456
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,161
The asteroid collision is
the beginning of eternal life, everyone.

457
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,538
Do not doubt.

458
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,291
Our future selves are waiting for us.

459
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,543
-Eternal life.
-Eternal life.

460
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,089
Though the asteroid might end the world

461
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,384
The glory of eternal life

462
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,469
-I hope they have cream buns.
-Bread!

463
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,553
There isn't any.

464
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,056
No, it's a shock wave!

465
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,475
A storm. A big earthquake.
Lots of shaking.

466
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,729
Then a tsunami and a great flood.
What will happen to the fallen asteroid?

467
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,147
I think you owe me a…

468
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,565
-A ration ticket?
-Yeah.

469
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,401
The asteroid will get smashed.

470
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,153
The debris will go up in the air

471
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,491
and then fall down like shotgun shells.

472
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,576
Or it could float and block the sunlight.

473
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,496
-You mean like impact winter?
-That's it.

474
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,583
Temperatures will drop, plants will die,
then so will animals, one by one.

475
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,878
Just like the dinosaurs that went extinct,
it'll be goodbye for us.

476
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,755
-Two packs of ramyeon, please.
-Ramyeon?

477
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,090
-Yes!
-Plain noodles too.

478
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,925
You can't have both.

479
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,094
-What?
-That's not a rule!

480
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,847
We're low on supplies.
You should think about others too.

481
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,267
Where are you going?

482
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,773
To renew my gun license.
Yeah, I think it's almost expired.

483
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,235
-Not up to anything stupid, are you?
-Don't worry.

484
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,863
Out of the way.

485
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,747
Let's have some peace before we die. Okay?

486
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,249
I'm not the same man I was before.
I'll be back.

487
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,884
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

488
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,263
If he comes back
with some weird contract again,

489
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,015
I'll kick him out right away.

490
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,184
He is such easy meat for scammers!

491
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,651
How can he

492
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,322
be like that after he lost his child?

493
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,453
I'll take over, okay?
Go inside and have some rest.

494
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,583
Good morning.

495
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,501
Hi.

496
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,924
She must miss Min-ho.

497
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,425
I guess so.

498
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,346
Why are all the dads so stupid?

499
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,890
How would I know? I never had one.

500
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,267
-Is that a good thing?
-Yeah!

501
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,271
-Thank you!
-We're leaving.

502
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,357
-I left some Netflix shows.
-Okay, see you.

503
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,858
-Have a good day.
-Goodbye.

504
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,492
THE LATE KIM MIN-HO
SEPTEMBER 1, 2011 - MAY 10, 2025

505
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,411
This is where you get info
on leaving the country.

506
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,206
Hey!

507
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,291
What's this? It's a gambling place.

508
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,209
It's been a while.

509
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,545
You must be insane.
Why did you bring me here?

510
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,046
I shouldn't be here.

511
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,132
Hey, wait up.

512
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,843
Just follow me. Come on.

513
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,220
Can you stop?

514
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,142
This floating bunker, does it really work?
How much is the down payment?

515
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,977
Get over here, man!

516
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,145
Give me a sec.

517
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,062
I got it.

518
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,106
Place the blinds, please.

519
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,650
Hey, the floating bunker's the real deal.
Listen to me.

520
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,902
We don't even have to go through a broker.

521
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,113
50,000 bucks up front,
100,000 after we get off.

522
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,658
Tell them to prepare
our entry permits first.

523
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,994
We can't pay without a guarantee.

524
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,371
Did you get your money back last time?

525
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,584
You know, the commission you paid
for your departure clearance.

526
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,919
He ran off, goddamn it.

527
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,920
Exactly.

528
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,632
That just proves
private services are all scammers.

529
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,217
How much did you lose?

530
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,056
Quite a lot.
I need something cheap and efficient now.

531
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,058
I don't know if this is efficient,

532
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,187
but if you want something cheap,
it's worth looking into.

533
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,146
Have a look.

534
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,981
-Hell, I don't wanna drown.
-All in!

535
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,817
That won't happen.
This was designed by scientists.

536
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,819
Even a tsunami won't topple it over.

537
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,154
Right on!

538
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,531
That's it!

539
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,704
I'm in a great mood today.
You want me to share some hot intel?

540
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,289
-Yes!
-Please!

541
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,459
Let's say this asteroid
crashes into the earth.

542
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,129
What are the chances of everything
being destroyed? High or low?

543
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,339
-Low!
-Low.

544
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,840
Not very high.

545
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,927
So let's say
we stayed alive for two weeks.

546
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,346
The chances of us
surviving after that are?

547
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,514
Definitely high!

548
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,849
Was that too easy?

549
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,017
Is he right?

550
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,478
But even then,
we would have many problems. Why?

551
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,439
There are just too many people
in this world.

552
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,609
I mean, look at all these people here.

553
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,027
Take a look around…

554
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,571
Wait. You…

555
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,492
you're Jeong Su-geun.
The YouTuber with a million subscribers!

556
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,743
-You are!
-It's him!

557
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,329
See, everyone recognizes you!

558
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,331
Nice to meet you!

559
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,832
It's an honor.

560
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,334
Where was I?

561
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,545
Anyway, there are too many people. Right?

562
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,676
We've built civilizations
and made scientific breakthroughs, right?

563
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,930
We stopped wars, cured diseases,
and tackled all our misfortunes

564
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,517
until we ended up
with this overpopulated mess of a world.

565
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,018
Wouldn't you like to see

566
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,022
the new world of the chosen ones,
the ones who survive?

567
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,608
-I would!
-Wouldn't you?

568
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,110
Yes, I would!

569
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,612
Then let the chosen ones
play another round!

570
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,491
-Go get chips.
-We can trust him, right?

571
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,375
-Looks like she's about to die.
-She's lost it.

572
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,043
She's dying.

573
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,589
YOU DIED

574
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,676
Why do you always die at that stage?
You were so close.

575
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,512
Hey, you try it. It's super hard to clear!

576
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,764
-I did last time!
-I'm the best player here.

577
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,849
You were the worst.

578
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,018
-What are you on about?
-You got 15 points!

579
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,103
I was just taking it easy.

580
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,355
Hey, I would score over 50 at least.

581
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,318
What?

582
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,527
Blackout again?

583
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,988
I hate this defective country!

584
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,740
The lights will be back on shortly.

585
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,993
-Kid, this one is hilarious.
-Do you have anything else?

586
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,578
-Bring some more next time.
-Sure.

587
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,164
-Yeah, something like music shows.
-Okay.

588
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,252
Something up with you again?

589
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,755
My dad is hopeless. You can't fix him!

590
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,173
I feel you.

591
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,175
What's up with you?

592
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,010
My dad is no better.

593
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,472
Hey, your dad might embarrass you,
but he didn't do anything dirty.

594
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,851
-The lights are back.
-It's back on.

595
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,186
Okay!

596
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,104
-Are you gonna play more? Wait!
-Wait up!

597
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,740
You're pretty good.

598
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,826
Hey, watch and learn.
Aim for the center and…

599
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,788
Great!

600
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,815
Don't go.

601
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,829
Are you Ha-yul?

602
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,247
Yes.

603
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,998
Why do you ask?

604
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,836
You look nothing like your dad.

605
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,213
She really doesn't.

606
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,090
You're cute.

607
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,009
Hey, stop it. You're scaring her.

608
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,639
I have something to show you.

609
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,563
Here.

610
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,611
Keep watching.

611
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,696
Look at her face.

612
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,791
That's your dad, right?

613
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,632
Don't go.

614
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,015
Summer will come,

615
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,894
then fall and winter will follow.

616
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,354
And when spring comes…

617
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,319
I can't believe
we only have one of each season left.

618
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,737
Stop being so depressing.

619
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,197
But it's true.

620
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,452
A woman like you
should just whistle your life away.

621
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,580
Make me some coffee.

622
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,873
As if we have any.

623
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,880
Can you please not make that face
when you talk to Ha-yul?

624
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,965
This is just what I look like!

625
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,635
Try to tuck your lips in.

626
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,722
You look so condescending
that it makes me feel like I'm stupid.

627
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,723
Your eyes scare me.

628
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,602
That's because you say stupid things,
just like now.

629
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,770
Is that you, Ha-yul?

630
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,440
Where the heck have you been?

631
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,192
None of your business.

632
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,860
That little…

633
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,446
How long are you going to act
like a spoiled brat?

634
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,365
For 199 days?

635
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,244
I know what you're thinking.

636
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,621
You're happy about the asteroid, huh?

637
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,122
What do you even mean?

638
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,167
-You were going nowhere with your grades.
-Don't start this again!

639
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:29,088
I went to a distinguished tech university
despite my miserable mother.

640
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,758
I've done everything you asked,
sending you abroad every school break

641
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,594
and getting you the latest phones
right as they are released!

642
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,762
What did you do?

643
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,222
Stop it!

644
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,225
I'm sick of your nagging.
Are you out of your mind?

645
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,560
Why are you venting on her?

646
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,979
You have to stop sticking up for her!

647
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,897
You are all crazy.

648
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,365
At least we got some snacks.

649
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,828
That's right.
Hardtacks, but they taste pretty good.

650
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,665
There are still so many people leaving.

651
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,752
Actually, no.
They're looting gas from abandoned cars.

652
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,634
Yes, Sergeant Yoon.

653
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,096
For now, we need to check inventory

654
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:23,142
and find out what and how much we need
before coming up with another plan.

655
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,396
All right.

656
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,524
-Captain.
-Yeah?

657
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,693
I think a city shuttle bus
has broken down.

658
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:43,704
INSPECTION UNDERWAY
HALT

659
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,219
SHUTTLE BETWEEN WOONGCHEON CITY HALL
AND SEOUL CITY HALL

660
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,971
Please get it fixed quickly.

661
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,892
What if we can't get there?

662
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,894
This bus won't be moving anytime soon.

663
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,563
-What do we do?
-Oh no!

664
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,902
It might be uncomfortable,
but you'll have to get in our snack truck.

665
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,405
Please get in the truck
in an orderly manner.

666
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,323
Thank you.

667
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,908
-Thank you!
-Take your time.

668
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,326
It's better than nothing.

669
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,327
In-a!

670
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,747
Hi. Hello?

671
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,924
In-a.

672
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,759
Fill the seats from the inside.

673
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,177
Kang In-a.

674
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,935
Hello, Father.
I guess you've been out of town.

675
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,063
-Yes, I was summoned by the bishop.
-I see.

676
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,608
All done?

677
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,776
-Wait.
-Oh, right.

678
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,945
Thank you!

679
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,325
This is ridiculous.

680
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,745
They made a talented officer like you
go beg for potatoes and onions?

681
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,374
Don't get me wrong.
Potatoes and onions are important, but--

682
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,046
I am on duty, Father.

683
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,798
Don't talk to me!

684
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,467
Okay, I won't. Let go of this.

685
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,054
-Tie it up.
-Yes, ma'am.

686
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,850
Thank you for your hard work.

687
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,020
Hey.

688
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,273
We're finally going. Thank you.

689
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,317
Stop the vehicle.
Halt for a moment, please.

690
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,076
What is this?

691
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,084
Sergeant.

692
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,587
What's going on over here?

693
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:04,386
No passport, and this English certificate
is the only identification he has.

694
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,014
-Go. I'll take care of him.
-Yes, sir.

695
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,599
Please step out of the vehicle.

696
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,107
Thank you for the ride.

697
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,632
What the…?

698
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,675
Maybe it's not four digits!

699
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,470
Damn. I'll break this open!

700
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,513
No!

701
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,224
The alarm might go off!

702
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,895
What am I supposed to do, then?
I don't know if it's five or six digits!

703
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,074
That's going to take forever!

704
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,763
I get to see you thanks to the father.

705
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,099
Why aren't you coming to Mass?

706
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,309
Are you going to face the end like that?

707
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:39,439
Your mother, no, Sister Myeong-ok said
you were a devout Catholic as a kid.

708
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,026
Back then, I came here
for delicious treats.

709
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,029
Father Baek used to have
all sorts of things in his room.

710
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,614
He still does.

711
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,783
In the secret storage basement.

712
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,952
Oh, is that so?

713
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,329
Then I guess
I should raid the place sometime.

714
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,042
Were you being serious?

715
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,547
But I don't know the passcode.

716
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,426
If I just knew how many digits it was.

717
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,921
You're saying that he is their VIP?

718
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,674
WOONGCHEON CITY MARTIAL LAW COMMAND
JOINT INVESTIGATION UNIT

719
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,092
Let's go in.

720
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,267
Did you enjoy the meal?

721
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,394
I can see that you did.

722
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,855
Do you smoke?

723
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,524
No, I don't.

724
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,612
Your identity's been verified,
but since your travel route was unusual,

725
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,614
the JIU will need to check
a lot of things.

726
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,951
From now on, you'll be monitored
by Deputy Head Song over here

727
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,411
and the investigation team leader, myself.

728
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,539
It's almost like I'm a wanted man.

729
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,380
Right.

730
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,340
In a way, you are.

731
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,310
Please make your daily report
at 5:00 p.m. every day

732
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,479
on things like your location
and current state.

733
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,897
There's no special reason.

734
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,983
Given your profession,

735
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,819
there are some sensitive issues
we need to watch out for.

736
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,529
Thank you…

737
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,157
for your cooperation today.

738
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,494
Remember, 5:00 p.m.

739
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,919
Well, it would have been much safer
to stay where you were.

740
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,841
I don't know who this friend of yours is,
but I truly envy them, you know.

741
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,093
I mean, everybody is dying
to leave the country.

742
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,472
City hall will contact you.
Report to them you aren't missing anymore.

743
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,020
This man will take you home safely.

744
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,938
He must be very tired now, okay?

745
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,109
So take the shortcuts to his home
as quickly and safely as possible.

746
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,653
-This way.
-Please get in.

747
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,709
Mr. Ha, your seatbelt.

748
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,091
Go. Let's go!

749
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,697
-Ms. Jin.
-Goodness!

750
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,618
Why are you so scared?
Making me feel awkward.

751
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,207
I told you to go home early.
Why are you still out at this hour?

752
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,750
You're out late too.

753
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,126
I'm a grown-up.

754
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,878
And I'll never be one.

755
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,009
Are you okay?

756
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,553
-Go home now.
-Okay.

757
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,182
You know, So-min is worried.

758
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,185
She's worried about me?

759
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,270
So you should go home early too.

760
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,633
Good evening.
Did you all arrive home safely?

761
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,636
It's time for the scumbags
to roam the streets, you know.

762
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,930
Comrades, let's stay together to the end.

763
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,768
I'm sure you remember the incident
where missing and kidnapped children

764
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,187
were tragically found dead in a container.

765
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,773
Oktokki has found out why that happened.

766
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,987
Once they survive the asteroid collision,
what would the king of survivors need?

767
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:42,242
Slaves to rebuild a capitalist system,
an obedient working class,

768
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:46,163
labor force of the future,
and at the core of the force, children.

769
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,000
That is why children keep disappearing,
even as we speak.

770
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,255
The scumbags kidnap children
and offer them up to the king.

771
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,593
What they receive in return
is a ticket to the safety zone.

772
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,262
Ticket to safety zone!

773
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,935
Trashy bastards.

774
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,121
Look at you all grow.

775
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,972
Calling me himself, huh?

776
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,976
-Yes.
-Why haven't I heard from you?

777
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,896
Did you sort out the goods?
What about the safe?

778
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,023
I took everything and left right away.

779
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,528
But Jong-su's phone was missing
along with some of the goods.

780
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,240
You should talk to Manager Im.

781
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,408
About what?

782
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,910
We can't let her be.

783
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,245
Not again, you punk.

784
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,538
Don't do anything rash.

785
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,008
Fucking JIU assholes.

786
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,387
What bullshit are they up to now?

787
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,363
When I'm told not to do something,
it makes me want to do it more.

788
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,034
Just you wait.

789
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,999
KIM JAE-U

TRAINING CENTER MANAGER IM

794
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,226
TRAINING CENTER MANAGER IM

795
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,981
"Manager Im."

796
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,569
"Manager Im."

797
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,447
Not here.

798
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,699
TRAINING CENTER MANAGER IM

799
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,868
Zero-seven-two-three.

800
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,211
Who is it?

801
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,048
In-a, is that you?

802
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:30,887
Mi-ryeong?

803
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,247
Who is it?

804
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,209
In-a, it's you, right?

805
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,114
Too late at night for a surprise, huh?

806
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,315
I forgot the passcode to my place,

807
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,983
so I came here instead.
