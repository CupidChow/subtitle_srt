14
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,205
Come on, don't make me regret
bringing you here.

15
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,249
It's so random. Just like you, Yun-sang.

16
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,126
What? That's not true.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,211
You dummy.

18
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,463
Keep this up, and I'll throw you out.

19
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,550
Don't get so upset and just be nice

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,636
if you're going to keep it.

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,721
I was going to throw this out anyway.

22
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,723
Not that thing over there.

23
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,850
This thing here!

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,310
-Grandma!
-"Ah."

25
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,479
Say "Ah."

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,231
There you go.

27
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,649
Yun-sang!

28
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,651
-Come down already.
-Hello.

29
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,653
Why is he taking so long?

30
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,780
Yun-sang!

31
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,532
I'm coming!

32
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,369
-Your grandma's calling you.
-Hello.

33
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,789
-Such a handsome kid.
-We should stop eating.

34
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,041
Watermelon's here!

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,209
Hello.

36
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,670
Oh, you went to buy watermelon?

37
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,297
Why are you always eating here?

38
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,550
Because I'm a good cook.

39
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,177
I told you not to carry heavy things.

40
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,595
It was nothing.

41
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,348
Have a bite. "Ah."

42
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,979
This saury paste is good!

43
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,607
My hands are so strange.

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,569
They always pick out
the most flavorless fruits.

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,572
That's fine because you raised
such a fine grandson.

46
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
-"Ah." Try it.
-Okay.

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,034
-How is it?
-It's sweet!

48
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,619
-Sweet.
-It's sweet?

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,038
-Cut some up for the kids.
-Okay.

50
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,418
Hey, you two should move out
and get your own place.

51
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,419
-What?
-What?

52
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,338
So the two of us grannies
can live through thick and thin

53
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,008
and enjoy a lovely life together.
How does that sound?

54
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,093
-Like it?
-Sounds great!

55
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,512
We didn't have
the best husbands or children.

56
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,848
-But we raised our grandchildren well.
-Yeah.

57
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,267
Now we should go and have some fun.

58
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,810
Yeah! You and I.

59
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,769
You and I?

60
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,521
You and I…

61
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
They're dating.

62
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,191
Yeah.

63
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,817
You and I…

64
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,735
Love it!

65
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,446
All day and all night

66
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,532
I cry because I miss you

67
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,034
-Love it.
-Spin around.

68
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,478
151 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

69
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,564
Se-kyung.

70
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,484
Yeah?

71
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,619
Let's go switch out with Sung-jae.

72
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,256
Ms. Jin Se-kyung,

73
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,676
you're under arrest for the murders
of Bae Jong-su and Lee Jae-min.

74
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,930
You have the right to an attorney
and the chance to state your case.

75
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,934
You have the right to challenge
the legality of your arrest.

76
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,560
-You can't do this.
-Let's go.

77
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,230
-You can't just take her away.
-Yun-sang!

78
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,148
-Se-kyung!
-Yun-sang.

79
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,316
-Se-kyung!
-Ms. Jin!

80
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,819
Se-kyung!

81
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,654
Let go of me! Se-kyung!

82
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,031
Se-kyung.

83
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,910
Been a while, huh?

84
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,791
We're just going to safeguard
your girlfriend for a little while.

85
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,628
To prevent any reckless acts.

86
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,964
Hand her over to the team leader.

87
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,426
Since she's such an important person.

88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,179
Se-kyung!

89
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,349
Damn it!

90
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,710
ETA at rally point one hour, over.

91
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,029
Father, Sung-jae!

92
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,946
Hi, Yun-sang.

93
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,408
They took Se-kyung.

94
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,743
Se-kyung? Why?

95
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,827
The JIU…

96
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,123
My phone isn't working!

97
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,541
Just wait.

98
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,754
Capt. Kang,
the JIU took Se-kyung early this morning.

99
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,755
What?

100
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,425
A guy named Song came and said
it was to prevent any reckless acts.

101
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,094
To prevent reckless acts?

102
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,887
He told me to wait just a little--

103
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,808
Yun-sang.

104
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,310
Can you hear me?

105
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,980
Call the JIU control room.

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,483
We haven't been able to reach them
for a while.

107
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,323
NO SIGNAL

108
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,076
He said to pack as lightly as possible.

109
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,370
I'll come back to get you.

110
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,746
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,582
Please use this phone from now on.

112
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,918
I'll contact you.

113
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,093
Grandma, what did he say?

114
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
I'm not sure.

115
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,639
I mean, is he really coming to get us?

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,768
No signal? Why isn't it going through?

117
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,355
Damn it.

118
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,358
Seriously, what's happening right now?

119
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,698
Father!

120
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,660
I found out that Kim Bo-ae,
the chief of staff's mother,

121
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,788
was told that she'd be picked up
this morning.

122
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,291
That means the chief of staff is also…

123
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,710
But something is a little strange.

124
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,964
She was told she'd be picked up,
but the driver had no idea.

125
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,259
Is this what I think it is?

126
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
-It's Capt. Kang.
-Here.

127
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,725
Hey, In-a.

128
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,770
The operation must be happening today.
That's probably why they took Se-kyung.

129
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,231
Yeah.

130
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,860
You have to get moving as fast as you can.

131
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,866
I couldn't remember
where I put the car keys!

132
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,201
I'll be back.

133
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,453
-Hurry. Drive safely.
-Okay.

134
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,704
Be careful!

135
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,465
It must be nice for him.

136
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,675
How so?

137
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,596
At least he has another sinking ship
to jump onto.

138
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,398
Hello?

139
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,776
Hey!

140
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,999
Well, what brings you here?

141
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,087
What is this?

142
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,841
It's my research data.

143
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,059
Oh, why don't you head inside?

144
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,319
Give this to the chief of staff.
Go right now.

145
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,126
Thomas.

146
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,883
It's a shame Clara had to be
so stubborn till the end.

147
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,264
That's not it.

148
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,101
I'm not ready yet.

149
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,275
Persuade Se-kyung for me.

150
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,820
I know you're doing this
for a great cause.

151
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,992
And I have the will to survive
and help build a better world.

152
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,831
But I can't escape on my own.

153
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,463
You're absolutely right.

154
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,840
I know

155
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,927
you can't leave without Clara.

156
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,763
Thank you. So…

157
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,396
-Yes?
-Jin Se-kyung.

158
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,481
Release her.

159
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,400
She's coming with Yun-sang.

160
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,694
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,048
Sir?

162
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,851
Get moving!

163
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,232
Looks like Ha Yun-sang saved you.

164
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,958
Captain!

165
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,960
Mess Sergeant?

166
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,171
Watch it.

167
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
-Captain.
-What?

168
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,179
I've figured it out. I think.

169
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,055
What?

170
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,975
The ammo buried
by the former supply officer.

171
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,810
First Sergeant Park.

172
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,732
Sergeant Park, aren't these supposed to be
sent to the Special Missions Unit?

173
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,568
At first, I thought it was an operation.

174
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,280
But it was weird that Park got discharged
right after the coup,

175
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,115
so I secretly moved them.

176
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,201
Do you seriously mean all of this?

177
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,621
Hey, if we try to move all this,
we might see the end of the world here.

178
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,581
-I see.
-Wanna die here?

179
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,499
-No.
-No, right?

180
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,042
-No.
-So what should we take?

181
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,710
-The ammo.
-Take only the ammo.

182
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,086
Pass it. Hurry.

183
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,341
Park came to see me several times
because of that.

184
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:25,429
Those weapons and this ammunition
were meant to be used by the SMU.

185
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,348
All you've done so far was for this?

186
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,725
Even the chicken coop?

187
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,352
The chicken coop?

188
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,364
For now, we keep them buried.

189
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,451
What?

190
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,620
Buried, you said?

191
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,539
For real?

192
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,345
How did you like prison chow?

193
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,932
I think they're out of supplies too.
They didn't feed me.

194
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,768
I bet you have better food at your base.

195
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,778
Let's go.

196
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,833
Ms. Jin hasn't called yet, has she?

197
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,626
No, my phone's not working.

198
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,129
And she's not answering my texts.

199
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,549
-He was the one with the gold.
-Go away!

200
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,552
-He's taking Young-ji away.
-We have to go now!

201
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,813
Hey, wake up. Your passengers are here.

202
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,742
Is the rumor true? You're leaving?

203
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,493
Let us in.

204
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,995
We should go together!

205
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,331
You aren't leaving us behind, are you?

206
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,166
-He's right!
-Where are you going?

207
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,543
-At least tell us that!
-Tell us!

208
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,962
Are you all packed?

209
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,050
Are you sure there are seats left?

210
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,137
Song said he'd come for me,
but I haven't heard from him.

211
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,851
Hey, if you do have room
for an old woman like me,

212
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,311
take In-tae instead.

213
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,897
Where do I have to go?

214
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,733
Don't worry.
Song will bring you to me soon.

215
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,817
See you there.

216
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,797
Grandma.

217
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,133
Are they really coming for us?

218
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,636
They're not coming to get us. We have to…

219
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,723
Where to? The US military base?

220
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,141
No, not there.

221
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,105
Wherever it is, I'm not going.

222
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,107
I don't trust him.

223
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,194
In-tae, he's still your father!

224
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,030
You're his son,
so he'll come for you at least.

225
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,282
-I just…
-Hey.

226
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,910
I just want to stay with you.

227
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,915
No, that can't happen.
You have to go no matter what.

228
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,833
No!

229
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
To all soldiers.

230
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,575
This is an emergency. Everyone, wake up.

231
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,172
Welcome back, Father!

232
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:36,096
I would've treated you to some wine,
but the storage was emptied out.

233
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
Where's Se-kyung right now?

234
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,729
Why? Are you not happy to see me?

235
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,487
How have you been?

236
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,280
Father Woo, be honest.

237
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,742
Don't you blame Father Baek
for leaving you out?

238
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,536
Don't you feel that way?

239
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,746
I'm actually relieved.

240
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,749
I don't think
I could've handled the inner conflict.

241
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,959
But I am a little disappointed.

242
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:10,422
Where's Clara right now?
She has to come with us.

243
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,010
She's here.

244
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,699
You said that I should confess
so my sins won't pile up on me, right?

245
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,535
I have a lot to confess.

246
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,830
Do you think you have time for this?

247
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,792
First,

248
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,879
I repent for doubting you, Father.

249
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,467
But I'm still curious about many things.

250
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,005
Song, it's been a while.

251
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,888
Let's have a chat.

252
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,526
This is nuts!

253
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,124
My informant.

254
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,793
-Are you done gathering intel?
-Yeah.

255
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,504
-Can I broadcast from over there?
-Sure.

256
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,737
When Asteroid Dina hits,

257
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,406
pretty much everyone will die.

258
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,908
They will all die anyway.

259
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,369
Comrades, do you know?

260
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:49,623
Today might be the last chance
to escape this country.

261
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,918
I bet you've been kept awake
by the planes and choppers.

262
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,920
Why do you think they're here?

263
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,259
Because of those trying to crawl
their way out to save only themselves.

264
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,135
The US military base?

265
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,554
That's all just a trick!

266
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,682
That's not our land.

267
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,186
It's for the remaining Americans
in Korea to make their last escape.

268
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,230
An exclusive area, if you will.

269
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,315
It's not the US military base.

270
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,317
It's the emergency strip.

271
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,028
But there is still a plane left
at the US base--

272
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,988
I know.

273
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,114
There's another one.

274
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,451
Check the location and get ready.

275
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,036
-What's your plan?
-No bullets.

276
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,622
We get the Woongcheon citizens
to stop the takeoff.

277
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,665
That's your goal?

278
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,334
I plan to get the kids on the plane.

279
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,796
Good.

280
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,341
A swift, well-coordinated,
chaos-free operation.

281
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,762
I'm not sure
if it can be done without chaos.

282
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,180
But given the situation,

283
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,975
it doesn't matter, does it?

284
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,059
You're right, sir!

285
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,399
Why aren't they picking up?

286
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,318
This is driving me crazy.

287
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,907
-Your call can't be connected.
-This place doesn't even have a clock.

288
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,367
Excuse me, what time is it?

289
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,412
Never mind. Just go.

290
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,123
Excuse me. Doctor?

291
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,626
You're only taking out an appendix.

292
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,921
Should it really be taking this long?

293
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,423
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,551
-We don't have the anesthetics yet.
-What?

295
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,219
And the phones are down.

296
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,723
So what's gonna happen
to Young-han's surgery?

297
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,601
I'll keep calling.

298
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,478
-But…
-Close the door.

299
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,988
Deputy Mayor! Ma'am?

300
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,115
What?

301
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,785
She can't possibly have…

302
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,703
I'm right here!

303
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,040
Are you okay? You haven't been caught?

304
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,958
I should've quit this job already.

305
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,171
It's crazy out there. People are rioting
and heading to the airstrip!

306
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,090
-The airstrip?
-Yes!

307
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,384
-What airstrip?
-The emergency airstrip!

308
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,427
-Let's go!
-Are you okay?

309
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,596
-Go!
-Okay, let's go.

310
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,681
Sister, what's the situation
at the church?

311
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,185
Ms. Jin is negotiating.

312
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,700
I have another sin I'd like to confess.

313
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,750
We'll soon be arriving
at the emergency airstrip.

314
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,710
Just follow orders.

315
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,521
Come on, hurry up!

316
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,522
It's going!

317
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,640
Who are they?

318
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,144
-They're not from the training center!
-Turn around now.

319
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,481
Do not turn around. Keep going.

320
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,816
-Stay in formation.
-We have a troop behind us.

321
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,153
What's going on? Maj. Jang!
What's happening here, you bastard?

322
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,738
That's Capt. Kang In-a's unit.

323
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,781
Just run them over!

324
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,200
You can't turn around!

325
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,417
Maj. Jang,
I thought you took all their ammunition!

326
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,795
Those guns must be empty.
They don't have any bullets.

327
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,880
Don't be scared.

328
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,845
We won't engage them directly.

329
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,182
The plane is coming here, right?

330
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,209
Now, that's enough.

331
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,004
I repent for this sin as well.

332
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,348
Grab your weapons.

333
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,271
What on earth is going on?

334
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,690
-Woo-chan, come here.
-Stay inside, kids.

335
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,823
-Where are you going?
-Just wait.

336
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,994
Stay in the car.

337
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,512
-Is everyone okay?
-Woo-chan, are you okay?

338
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,099
Ha-yul, come here.

339
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,935
-No, where are you going? Ha-yul!
-Woo-chan, wait.

340
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,061
Hey, get in quickly.

341
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,814
Get in here. Hurry up!

342
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,525
-Jin-seo!
-Get in. Is everyone in?

343
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,526
Ha-yul, you okay?

344
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,578
Why the hell would you fire that gun?

345
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,301
Disobey and you'll be executed!

346
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,510
Retreat now!

347
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,979
Take your shot, you bastards!

348
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,731
Go on, shoot!

349
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,816
Clara,

350
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,779
let's save the confessions for later--

351
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,657
No. We should finish what we started.

352
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,241
Clara!

353
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,868
Where is Cho Gwang-hyeon?

354
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,538
Do you not know?

355
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,416
Where will you board the plane?

356
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,128
There's only a military aircraft left
at the US base.

357
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,382
All the people who have paid
won't fit in one plane.

358
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:59,177
Clara, why are you throwing
this precious opportunity away?

359
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,186
All you need to do is give one order.

360
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,272
Just tell them
to allow the minors on the plane.

361
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,574
I don't have the power.

362
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,930
That was your last chance,
and you threw it away.

363
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,641
I'm sorry,

364
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,394
but we tricked you.

365
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,689
What?

366
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,704
Father, just the children, please.

367
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,167
Wait.

368
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,418
Father!

369
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,514
We can't get to the airstrip.
Apparently, the road's blocked by--

370
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,432
No.

371
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,561
There's no need to go that way. Just wait.

372
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,278
Auntie! Look, it's an airplane!

373
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,362
Mom, an airplane.

374
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,246
What? Captain, look at the airstrip.

375
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,009
We're gonna die anyway!

376
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,803
-You crazy bastards!
-Shoot me!

377
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,003
Over here!

378
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,588
Come back!

379
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,590
Come back!

380
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,468
You have to take the kids!

381
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,220
Come back!

382
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,806
Come back here!

383
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:38,980
Wait.

384
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,150
I'm not leaving without my kids.

385
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,905
A little faster, okay?
We have to go faster!

386
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,157
Where's the entrance?

387
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,409
You were the reason I was able to hold on.

388
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,537
I wanted to trust you to the very end.

389
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,873
What are you doing? I said to go faster!

390
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,544
I don't have a reason to hold on anymore.

391
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,006
There. Over there!

392
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,363
Damn it. Hurry!

393
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,865
Damn it!

394
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,034
No!

395
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,037
No!

396
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,182
No.

397
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,397
No! I'm not on board yet!

398
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,733
No!

399
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,020
The JIU is withdrawing, ma'am.
What should we do?

400
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,441
Captain, please give an order.

401
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,443
Captain?

402
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,614
Let them go.

403
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,161
Send the citizens home and return to base.

404
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,387
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

405
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,268
This is breaking news.

406
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,606
The military aircraft that took off today
from the Woongcheon US military base

407
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,527
for a safe zone on the US East Coast
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

408
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:18,699
Search and rescue operations are underway,
but so far, no survivors have been found.

409
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,868
I repeat.

410
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,705
The military aircraft that took off today
from the Woongcheon US military base

411
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,876
for a safe zone on the US East Coast
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

412
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,503
The cause of the crash--

413
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,392
Grandma.

414
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,148
It's getting chilly.

415
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,691
-Here's your coffee.
-Thanks.

416
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,359
Is it okay here?

417
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,528
Yeah, it's nice.

418
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,947
The fire's going.

419
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,624
Do you remember?

420
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,752
It was about five years ago.

421
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,670
Our apartment was old.

422
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:59,342
The paint was peeling so badly
that we couldn't tell the buildings apart.

423
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,511
The kids couldn't find their homes
and didn't know what to do,

424
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,931
looking all puzzled and confused.

425
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,641
That's right.

426
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,270
Then one kid drew arrows on the street

427
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,273
because he thought
he wouldn't be able to find his way home.

428
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,358
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,610
And the other kids did the same thing.

430
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,530
The street was covered in arrows.
It was a mess.

431
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,741
Goodness, it was really funny at the time.

432
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,077
How foolish.

433
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,789
He should have at least remembered
how to get home.

434
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,749
Making a mess in front of our store--

435
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,708
You forgot.

436
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,756
It was Min-ho's idea
to draw arrows on the street.

437
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,553
He got a piece of chalk from school
and drew some very impressive arrows.

438
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,390
You got mad at him then.

439
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,026
The day before we left,
you cleaned Min-ho's room, didn't you?

440
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,362
You noticed?

441
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,863
Of course.

442
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,325
How could I not
with all that clattering at night?

443
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,371
I see.

444
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,377
He was a kind boy.

445
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,339
Our Min-ho.

446
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,678
Just a little longer,

447
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,598
and the three of us can be together again.

448
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,755
Take a look at this!
This is what I call spaceship rice cakes.

449
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,008
What are you talking about?
Look, these are North Korean rice cakes.

450
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,092
Big, right?

451
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,761
They look cool, don't they?

452
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,013
-Look.
-This feels just like the holidays.

453
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,931
Check these out!

454
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,850
They came out pretty.

455
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,393
Yeah, they look delicious.

456
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,897
See? The spaceship rice cakes
look the most delicious.

457
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,566
Here comes a spaceship!

458
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,902
Have a bite. Go on!

459
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,362
Yes. They're good, right?

460
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:26,947
Good, huh?

461
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,909
Hey, that's cold!

462
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,869
Let's save some water. Dear me.

463
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,372
As if that'll make you rich.

464
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,795
So this is our last Chuseok.

465
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,674
I wonder if we'll get to see in Seollal
before the end.

466
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,386
Since the kids aren't here,

467
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,264
the holidays feel empty.

468
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,647
How about we watch one of those

469
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,568
brutal horror movies
where everyone gets murdered?

470
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,490
What's fun about a movie
where people get brutally murdered?

471
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,829
At least it will make us think

472
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:20,918
that the asteroid hitting us
would be a better death than that.

473
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,507
It would make us fools
to watch movies at a time like this.

474
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,135
Who cares if we're fools?

475
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,929
You reckon?

476
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,931
Yeah, I do!

477
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:41,814
Destruction…

478
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,275
What a life.

479
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,152
-To die at the age of 14.
-Whatever.

480
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,528
138 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

481
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,487
What did you write?

482
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,865
-Standing position!
-Standing position!

483
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,494
-Return!
-Return!

484
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,414
-Kneeling position!
-Kneeling position!

485
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,806
Se-kyung.

486
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,349
Yeah?

487
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,988
83 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

488
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,701
Here, take the rice first.

489
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,869
Okay.

490
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,871
Wow, look at all this stuff.

491
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,123
How much is all this worth anyway?

492
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,044
She could've shared this sooner.

493
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,546
Just be happy she's sharing it now, okay?

494
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,299
Hurry up and take it
before she changes her mind.

495
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,717
Thank you!

496
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,513
What are you staring at?

497
00:41:55,596 --> 00:42:00,184
You're young and strong.
Come out and carry this stuff, okay?

498
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,102
Hey…

499
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,695
-You have to keep them separate.
-This is a whole different world.

500
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,613
Here.

501
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,700
Sister! Come here now.

502
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,370
-It'll take a while to move all this.
-I know.

503
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,997
-Finally, we'll eat some rice.
-That's it for the rice.

504
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,457
-Should we divide these?
-Easy.

505
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,833
He's going to come.

506
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,461
He'll come.

507
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,712
He will.

508
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,465
That's what he said. He--

509
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,467
You saw the news.

510
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,515
You think God's punishing me, don't you?

511
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,599
Yes.

512
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,142
That's right.

513
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,064
You made my grandmother suffer
and made people's lives hard.

514
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,821
I've led a sinful life, haven't I?

515
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:58,492
But still, I thought I raised my son well.

516
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,620
None of us…

517
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,958
have been abandoned.

518
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,168
What?

519
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,505
We've survived.

520
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,184
What do you think?

521
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,604
It's pretty big, isn't it?
Will this be enough?

522
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,188
Of course.

523
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,483
Thank you for arranging this place for me.

524
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,444
Well, I'm just happy to help.

525
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:39,867
You know,

526
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,287
this seems really fun and romantic.

527
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,793
You writing a memoir for people.

528
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,214
It's not going to be that grandiose.

529
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,468
Just in my spare time
as I help with the work here.

530
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,639
I'm not sure if you'll have the time.
Over 200 people have already applied.

531
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,681
What?

532
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,934
Take your time looking around.

533
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,478
It's cold.

534
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,147
Hi.

535
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,692
Do you have the documents
I asked for last time?

536
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,319
You'll have them by the afternoon.

537
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,237
This afternoon? Sure. No rush.

538
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,159
Have you eaten?

539
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,411
It's all right.

540
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,330
I'll have something later.

541
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,465
TODAY'S MEAL
KIMCHI SUJEBI

542
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,758
-Hi, Sister!
-It was delicious.

543
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,759
Hello!

544
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,261
-It's cold today, huh?
-Yes.

545
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,429
Hello.

546
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,014
Hey, you came.

547
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,599
I'm here for the sujebi.

548
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,101
It tastes amazing today.

549
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,186
Wait. Come here.

550
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,771
-Hello.
-Hello, Sister.

551
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,773
Have you heard anything

552
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,942
about Father Woo?

553
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,302
Father, it's time to eat…

554
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,859
You don't have to bring me
my meals from now on.

555
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,612
I'm going to maintain the church
as a layman--

556
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,530
A lay…

557
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,741
a layman?

558
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,951
Maintain the church?

559
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,455
I already notified the diocese.

560
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,875
Father!

561
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,129
Father! This isn't right.

562
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,798
The elders of the diocese
would never allow this!

563
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,218
No one's there. The head nun
and the bishop are both in a nursing home.

564
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,803
Father!

565
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,097
How can you be doing this?

566
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,143
I've known you since you were
in seminary school, haven't I?

567
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,354
I know you're upset, but…

568
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,941
But… Father?

569
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,568
Father!

570
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,988
What are the believers supposed to do?

571
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,825
It doesn't make any sense
that our church has no priest!

572
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,911
Father!

573
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,582
What's wrong with you?

574
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,502
You should've told me at least.

575
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,963
I thought you would've guessed.

576
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,762
Sometimes I feel like you get a kick
out of these surprise stunts.

577
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,056
That's not it.

578
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,476
Think about it.
Would I be in my right mind right now?

579
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,230
I mean, I know that, but…

580
00:46:58,941 --> 00:46:59,942
What?

581
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,739
Hello.

582
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,038
Did he get any sleep last night?

583
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,499
No.

584
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,965
He kept saying the same thing
over and over all night.

585
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,592
I nearly lost it.

586
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,762
Sung-jae.

587
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,975
Just record it.
Record it and have him listen to it.

588
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,145
Then tell him, "You just said that."

589
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,313
You're crazy.

590
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,356
Idiot.

591
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,525
You do it.

592
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,450
Sung-jae!

593
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,874
Enjoy your meal.

594
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,210
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure, enjoy.

595
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,128
I will.

596
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,629
-Father.
-Yes.

597
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,381
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

598
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,431
Mr. Woo Sung-jae.

599
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,974
I heard you quit being a priest.

600
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,561
See? They all know.

601
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,563
How did you know?

602
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,773
If Sister Regina knows, everyone knows.

603
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,941
Huh?

604
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,485
Is someone talking about me?

605
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,035
Look at him.

606
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,454
His prayers got shorter
now that he's not a priest.

607
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,374
This is the best version of you
I've seen so far.

608
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,251
Yeah.

609
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,794
I agree.

610
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:44,922
Let's eat.

611
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,691
This is good.
