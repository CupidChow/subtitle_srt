00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,425
Be the awesome superman…

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,385
557 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,804
Min-ho, never forget
that this is thanks to me.

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:13,722
Thank you.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,436
-I put your photo up in the science room.
-Min-ho.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,646
Do you want to be a scientist
like Yun-sang?

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,107
No, this is more like a fan thing.

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,528
-Beer tastes best after soccer.
-It sure does!

9
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,989
-Hi!
-Father Baek's here.

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,948
-Father.
-Yes?

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,783
So did you win your revenge match?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,701
Revenge match?

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,327
-Father Woo.
-Yes?

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,412
Have a beer.

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,748
He started out strong,
but I caught up to him.

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,208
You must be boiling inside.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,086
Father, in both tennis and the military,
experience beats everything.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,755
Yes, of course!

19
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,007
-Oh, Clara.
-Yes?

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,550
How's the soccer club?

21
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,178
You know us. We're rocking it.

22
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,097
I don't get why
she's coaching the team so hard.

23
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,558
It's just a club, not a pro team.

24
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,478
That way, I can pass out
as soon as I get home.

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,146
-And it's fun, right?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,357
Pass out as soon as you get home?
What about me?

27
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,027
Come on, it's not like we do it every day.

28
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,113
Is this dirty talk I'm hearing?

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,032
-I wonder how we got here.
-Do what?

30
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,366
What do they do?

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,534
Stop it!

32
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,535
Min-ho's here.

33
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,703
What is it they do?

34
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,371
Do what?

35
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,875
Listen, I'll be officiating
your nuptial Mass, okay?

36
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,460
Thank you in advance.

37
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,128
Hello, Father!

38
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,380
-Hi, kids.
-Thank you!

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,094
When the time stands still
You're asleep, I come to you

40
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,056
The world gets in my way
But I end up by your side

41
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,725
My long journey's finally over

42
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:46,356

This again.

56
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,220
We agreed not to meet outside!

57
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,221
My bad.

58
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,309
I'm sorry that my phone is too crappy
to send you a video, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,856
Have a look.

60
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,986
That's him. That's Dad's driver.

61
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,367
Do you recognize these addresses?

62
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,289
PHOTO FROM SE-KYUNG

63
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,082
Only this one.

64
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,212
This is the last place the driver went
to deliver wine for Dad.

65
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,298
-Send this to Capt. Kang's phone.
-Okay.

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,554
Yeah, I can hear you. Go ahead.

67
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,141
I can talk right now. Yun-sang is driving.

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,059
Yeah.

69
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,770
-Can't you hear me?
-I hear you--

70
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,317
This is insane.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,569
Captain, what are you…

72
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,243
18-1, GUGAK-RI, EUNGDEOK-MYEON
WOONGCHEON, GYEONGGI-DO

73
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,538
Did you get the text?

74
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,506
Yeah, we're on our way there now.

75
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,675
Can you hear me? Hello?

76
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,009
Hello…

77
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,390
Officially,
this is civilian protection duty.

78
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,059
It will take you one hour.
Report to me in ten minutes.

79
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:28,977
Understood.

80
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,478
Na Hyeon-jae.

81
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,813
Ma'am.

82
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,649
Sorry. I'm a little worried.

83
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,150
No, I'm fine, ma'am.

84
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,945
-We'll be going, then.
-Okay.

85
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,179
Where to?

86
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,473
We're going to Gugak-ri, Eungdeok-myeon.

87
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,642
You have to go back. Please turn around.

88
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,732
Who are you looking for?

89
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,069
I asked who you're looking for.

90
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,074
We're going to meet
Father Baek Sang-hyeok.

91
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,995
Father Baek has visitors.

92
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,706
Okay.

93
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,334
Let them through!

94
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,920
This is the training center.

95
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,300
Father, you have a frightening guest.

96
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,925
Se-kyung. Yun-sang.

97
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,138
Wasn't it hard for you to find this place?

98
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,352
Goodness, I'm sorry
I made you both come all this way.

99
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,147
My dear Clara.

100
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,566
And Thomas.

101
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm so happy to see you.

102
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,031
We have a lot to talk about.

103
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,288
We should at least
make our confessions, shouldn't we?

104
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,709
Since the two of you have
your nuptial Mass ahead of you.

105
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,545
No.

106
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,924
Confessions have to be done individually.

107
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,220
You must stand on your own
in the face of God and confront yourself.

108
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,805
-That's not--
-Clara.

109
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,515
The thing about confessions

110
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,684
is that the more sins you pile up,

111
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,770
the harder it becomes.

112
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,961
You're right.

113
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,423
Up to this point,

114
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,427
I'd committed murder
about three times in my mind.

115
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,179
Hey, now.

116
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,639
Clara.

117
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,267
I've always told you.

118
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,147
The more you push back on your homework,
the harder it is to finish.

119
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,233
And then you just become numb.

120
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,820
As if you have a scab
over your entire body.

121
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,670
But, you know,

122
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,550
God always forgives.

123
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,304
He never gets tired of it.

124
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,184
He doesn't have that in him.

125
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,648
I'll figure that out on my own.

126
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,234
I have no intention
of avoiding my punishment.

127
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,364
Sure.

128
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll pray for you.

129
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:01,624
Until the day you reflect on yourself,
repent of your sins,

130
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,752
and find the resolve not to sin again,

131
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,549
God will wait for you
with love and patience.

132
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,517
So have you recovered your strength?

133
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,065
It seems that God

134
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,402
has a great purpose for you two.

135
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,240
We are on earth while he is above.

136
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,494
It is indeed difficult to say
what his intentions are,

137
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,125
but just look at how we've been reunited
after all these hardships.

138
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,378
On the way here,

139
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:52,967
I prayed that all this would be
just a rumor, that it's not true, but…

140
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,679
I don't know
what great plan you have in mind…

141
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,433
but stop hiding and come back.

142
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,062
Explain to the church members
what has happened to you up to now.

143
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,825
Yun-sang.

144
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,455
That is a very human thing to say.

145
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,293
In other words…

146
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,882
it's nothing more than bodily wisdom.

147
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,720
Father.

148
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,433
It's not just us two.
Many people were hurt by this.

149
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,730
We have no time to forget and to heal.

150
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,486
A four-year-old boy
who envies his seven-year-old sister

151
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,988
will never grow up to be seven.

152
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,701
All any of us have left
is a very short future.

153
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,329
But how could you…

154
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,338
Let's stick to the original plan.

155
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,762
But I'll prepare a plan B.

156
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,933
Yes. Okay.

157
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,740
Those who have a purpose to serve

158
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
should, of course, be taken.

159
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,664
But there isn't much time.

160
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,126
I trust Yun-sang…

161
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,838
will make a wise decision.

162
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,883
Let's say…

163
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,178
an hour before we depart,

164
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,515
I'll come to get you.

165
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,244
What is this? You never go out at night.

166
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,370
I met a friend.

167
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,914
We meet in person sometimes.

168
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,916
Attaboy.

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,296
You should go out sometimes.
Don't just stay at home all the time.

170
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,434
But, Grandma…

171
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,269
Yes?

172
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,939
You aren't going to abandon me, are you?

173
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,524
What?

174
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,361
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

175
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,322
Dad's driver said

176
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,285
that you and I are moving
to Dad's official residence.

177
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,456
Not on my watch.

178
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,460
My goodness.

179
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,670
He thinks he can have everything his way.

180
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,510
I'd never abandon you.
It's your father I'd rather leave.

181
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,098
Don't worry. Go to your room and rest.

182
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,783
I wanted to provide an escort for you,
but you don't want my kindness, I see.

183
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,748
One of our men will be driving your car.

184
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,375
Captain's orders.

185
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,837
Everyone, on board!

186
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,089
I sincerely hope

187
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,885
you two will make a wise decision.

188
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,944
Father.

189
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,699
Father!

190
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,787
Come on!

191
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,872
Just one word!

192
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,798
Please just respond with one word.

193
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,472
I'll go out then.

194
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,585
I found some CDs.

195
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,003
I got this.

196
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,504
152 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

197
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,340
-We can put videos in that.
-Yeah.

198
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,549
That's quite a lot.

199
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,096
I guess Netflix isn't making
any more series, huh?

200
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,599
Hey, our reality surpasses all TV shows.

201
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,018
What idiot would keep making them?

202
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,187
And this would be
the last season of our life.

203
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,941
But it seems like
there are a lot of weird directors

204
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,026
who still want to shoot stuff.

205
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,946
But there are no actors.
They don't wanna act anymore.

206
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:47,947
I thought so.

207
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,034
I bet they bought shelters to hide in
with all the money they saved up.

208
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,204
What is this?

209
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,416
Why are there so many?

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,835
They're not from our town, are they?

211
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,004
Obviously not.
They have different uniforms.

212
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,172
Let's go to Ms. Jin.

213
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,548
Hey, let's go.

214
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,883
-Get out.
-Let's go.

215
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,135
-Come on.
-Leave now!

216
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,070
Are they abandoning this place now?

217
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,661
-Are you ok--
-Are you okay?

218
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,872
Me?

219
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,791
Since the training center incident,

220
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,419
there's been a rumor
that you will be dismissed.

221
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,921
It's all over the base.

222
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,010
Don't worry about me.

223
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,429
How's Young-ji?

224
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,472
Have you seen her since then?

225
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,642
No, ma'am, not even once.

226
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,186
She didn't seem to have a cell phone.

227
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,688
It's okay, ma'am.

228
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,572
Hey.

229
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,408
The airfield has division-level security.

230
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,160
If my hunch is correct,

231
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,373
I think their mission is to evacuate
the remaining Americans in Korea.

232
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,250
Unbelievable!

233
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,668
Wait.

234
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,628
The US military base?

235
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,214
Soldiers. The US.

236
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,425
Does that mean planes?

237
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,594
What? You already know?

238
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,888
I guess you were right, Sister Regina.

239
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,557
They're moving up their plan.

240
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,642
Excuse me?

241
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,937
Se-kyung, can we talk for a minute?

242
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:46,899
Okay.

243
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,988
What are you going to do now, Father?

244
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,741
We can't keep waiting for God's words!

245
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,868
Let's do something badass this time.

246
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,578
Yun-sang.

247
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,247
Did Father Baek say anything else?

248
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,541
Does he know
that the church was set on fire?

249
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,007
Here.

250
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,218
It's been a while.

251
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,348
When are you and Yun-sang leaving?

252
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,895
Se-kyung.

253
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:26,939
Yes?

254
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,566
Has In-a

255
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,820
ever mentioned anything

256
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,782
about In-seong?

257
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,159
In-seong?

258
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,871
About how

259
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,083
In-seong died.

260
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,335
He died in an accident during the riots…

261
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,215
After the chaos broke out…

262
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,387
we ran out of food for a short time.

263
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,099
We couldn't reach In-a for over a week.

264
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,105
But In-seong couldn't wait.

265
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,275
He went downtown

266
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,486
to find some food.

267
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,824
But then he…

268
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,876
Without even a chance

269
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,794
to fight back,

270
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,756
he was killed in vain.

271
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
It happened

272
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,143
in the red-light district
that In-a's old team raided a while ago.

273
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,108
A fellow believer
who had a store there told me…

274
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,364
that she saw a tall, skinny person
behind In-seong.

275
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,117
And he…

276
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,377
So I told In-a.

277
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,258
But she just said "tall and skinny"
can mean just about anybody.

278
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,219
She said to keep it quiet

279
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,556
and get back to my life, going back
and forth between home and church.

280
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,312
Sure, there's not much time left anyway.

281
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,564
That's what I told myself,

282
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,817
and I tried not to think about it,

283
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,278
but people kept dying there
one after the other.

284
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,908
At first, I thought someone
just happened to kill In-seong's killer.

285
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,577
But…

286
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,139
Ever since she was little,
In-a could never let these things go.

287
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,648
But she's a soldier.

288
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,359
In-a

289
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,737
wants to protect people until the end.

290
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,243
Right.

291
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,955
That's probably it, right?

292
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,872
Yes.

293
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,382
What a grim world this is,
rife with revenge.

294
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,594
I'm afraid that revenge…

295
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,932
is something that God will never forgive.

296
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,990
Mess Sergeant, good work.

297
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,915
Does she have to stay here?

298
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,835
Well, I'd rather she doesn't.

299
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,755
You're dismissed now.

300
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:30,265
I heard Sergeant So here used to be
part of the Special Missions Unit.

301
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,517
You sure are close.

302
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,436
Right?

303
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,738
I think we're seeing each other too often.

304
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,117
Thanks to all the unreported operations
you've been leading.

305
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,035
This incident--

306
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,870
What about the stolen ammunition?

307
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,705
That's been cleared--

308
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,917
As you know, that ammunition was
on its way to the SMU.

309
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,294
Am I still being too harsh?

310
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,635
-Search the place!
-Yes, sir.

311
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,639
299 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

312
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,391
Can't you see the road is jammed?

313
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,018
We've been stuck here for hours!

314
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,521
You soldiers should stop blocking the way!

315
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,151
Colonel, it looks like they started
a blockade on Woongcheon.

316
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,736
It's a coup within the military.

317
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,489
Seizing strategic arms,
destroying key facilities,

318
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,533
attempting asylum, and inciting riots.

319
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,161
Many military commanders
and the police leadership have joined.

320
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,130
Our battalion will not be engaging.

321
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,049
Protect the VIPs as ordered, over.

322
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,974
I'm Maj. Jang, aide-de-camp
to the division commander. Let me through.

323
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,891
Yes, sir!

324
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,486
Let's break through the opposite lane.

325
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,293
What the hell?

326
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,919
Sir.

327
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,089
The division commander fucking ran off!

328
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,092
Fucking bullshit.
I should've known when he didn't respond.

329
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,096
Fuck!

330
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,688
My leg!

331
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,941
Ju-yeon! Are you okay?
Hey, stop the bleeding. Hold it tight.

332
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,568
-Where's the medic?
-Hyeon-sik!

333
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,570
Hey, hold her up, you bastard!

334
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,779
Hold her!

335
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,824
General!

336
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,410
Are you okay, sir?

337
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,162
General!

338
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,208
The rebel leaders are escaping.

339
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,292
We must stop them.

340
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,380
All SMU units, withdraw.

341
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,340
Over.

342
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,970
I repeat. All units, withdraw!

343
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,389
I can't follow an order
to let the rebels escape.

344
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,307
Hey, Kang!

345
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,643
Let's shoot warning shots first.
Open fire.

346
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,282
Cease fire!

347
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,868
That's punishable by death!

348
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,037
Capt. Kang In-a! Kang!

349
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,956
Kang In-a!

350
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,964
Guys, you can eat a lot today.

351
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:55,720
Even though the world is ending,
you should eat and grow while you can.

352
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,475
-Mess Sergeant!
-Yeah?

353
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,643
They let you go?

354
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,312
Are you okay?

355
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,946
The Joint Investigation Unit
even went through our snack storage.

356
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,658
Hey, Pang.

357
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,159
Yes?

358
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,744
Let's just…

359
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,749
Let's do our job.

360
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:30,255
Okay, we're going to take
all of the potatoes out of here.

361
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,423
-Ma'am?
-What?

362
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,424
All of them?

363
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,925
-Yeah!
-But there are so many.

364
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,970
Does anyone know how to plant
these seed potatoes to grow more?

365
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,888
No idea.

366
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,308
Take a look at this seed potato.

367
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,103
You'll find these spots
where the buds are concentrated.

368
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,940
Now cut out a nice piece around that spot

369
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,109
with two to three buds in it.

370
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,821
Next, use the ash
from things like firewood.

371
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,240
The ash acts as a sterilizer,

372
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,577
so put it all over the sides
and give it protection.

373
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,289
Plant the budding potatoes,
pun intended, back into the ground.

374
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,415
Then, guys,

375
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,335
we'll be able to eat like kings
next summer.

376
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,045
I like it!

377
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,717
But the thing is,
we don't have a next summer.

378
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:23,975
Sometimes we forget that we don't.

379
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,310
Same here.

380
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,482
-Guys! What should we make today?
-Seed potato cakes.

381
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,485
What the hell are seed potato cakes?

382
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,244
Why did you call me here?

383
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,542
You asked for this.

384
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,671
Stop fooling around. Hand it over.

385
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,061
Do you know how to use this?

386
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,148
I do. I practiced at a shooting range.

387
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,950
Hey!

388
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,451
Watch your fingers.

389
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,127
As long as it's not fake.

390
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,254
Fuck.

391
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,888
Has that girl lost her fucking mind?

392
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,020
Yeah, so they just need to set
an exact date and tell me.

393
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,229
Yeah, okay.

394
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,109
Let's talk.

395
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,238
You have to trust my plan.
We're out of time.

396
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,577
They're getting a chartered plane,
and we have to get on it.

397
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,124
This time, we won't have to worry
about a yellow list or anything.

398
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,047
This time, we won't have to worry
about a yellow list or anything.

399
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,051
Hey, what's wrong?

400
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,806
Hey.

401
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,536
Sergeant Kim, you son of a bitch.

402
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,165
They're all the same!

403
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,368
Up to this point,

404
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,497
I'd committed murder
about three times in my mind.

405
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,107
Those who have a purpose to serve

406
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,944
should, of course, be taken.

407
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,696
But there isn't much time.

408
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,701
Let's say…

409
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,955
an hour before we depart,

410
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,208
I'll come to get you.

411
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,466
I trust Yun-sang will make
a wise decision.

412
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,651
There they go again.

413
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,081
Hey.

414
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,002
I know you have quite a tight network.

415
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,841
You know why they're surrounding
the airfield, don't you?

416
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,430
It's just as you've heard.

417
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,850
So it's true?

418
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,894
Is a plane going to be taking off
like last time?

419
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:43,980
I'm not sure.

420
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,318
We'll see about that.

421
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,196
What do you mean?

422
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,463
Se-kyung.

423
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,381
Yun-sang. Wait.

424
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,812
Why are you

425
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,649
only telling me this now?

426
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,528
I was embarrassed.

427
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,867
Although everyone already knows
what kind of person my dad is.

428
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,410
Ha-yul.

429
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,213
The most important person to you

430
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,173
is you.

431
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,135
But that's not true for you.

432
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,013
I'm the most important person to me.

433
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,265
That's why

434
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,602
you're precious to me.

435
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,232
So are Jin-seo and So-min.

436
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,321
And all the other kids

437
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,990
who have already left us.

438
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,827
All of them.

439
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,836
You can cry. Come here.

440
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,715
You did well.

441
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,425
I told you not to look for me.

442
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,221
You act cold, but all this stuff
you've prepared for us says otherwise.

443
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,435
This certainly is important,
but I have something to discuss with you.

444
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,689
I'm in need of a strategy.

445
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,152
I heard about everything.

446
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,865
Storming the training center
was a good move.

447
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,452
Your friend getting involved,
though accidental, was good too.

448
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,580
But that became a signal to them.

449
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,085
The JIU started cracking down
on even low-level subordinates.

450
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:57,924
But the JIU still doesn't seem to know
where the missing ammunition is.

451
00:36:59,133 --> 00:36:59,967
Interesting.

452
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,054
They'd been meaning to search
every corner of the base,

453
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,097
and a shooting took place just in time?

454
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,432
Yes.

455
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,977
They're trying to connect the stolen ammo
with the SMU.

456
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,314
They even took the ammo
for guard duty, right?

457
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,690
Yes.

458
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,276
It feels like they're planning something.

459
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,031
Something that doesn't need
some dogged captain getting in the way.

460
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,244
An escape?

461
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,739
We will have to leave soon.

462
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,786
After joining the kids at the hospital,
we'll board the plane.

463
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,333
We will leave as soon as we get the call,
so we need to be thoroughly prepared.

464
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,794
As of now,

465
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,214
leaving this building is prohibited.

466
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,887
Our children will be joining us, right?

467
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,098
I can't leave my children behind.

468
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,558
Of course.

469
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,102
You're worried about nothing.

470
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,979
Stop worrying.

471
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,898
And pack your bags.

472
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,195
Only those who are ready
will avoid disaster.

473
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,907
We will break free from disease…

474
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,745
competition, and pain,

475
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,664
and go to the heaven on earth
that we have prepared!

476
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,833
Let us leave…

477
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,337
together.

478
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,470
-How does this feel?
-Are you done examining him?

479
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,096
Is it okay? How about here?

480
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,266
-Does it hurt?
-It hurts.

481
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,019
When I press down
or when I take my hands off?

482
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,187
Both hurt.

483
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,104
Both?

484
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,196
His inflammation levels show
an issue with his appendix.

485
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,447
Appendix?

486
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,990
Didn't it hurt before?

487
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,660
I told them it hurt, but…

488
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,828
But

489
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:38,250
they kept saying we were leaving soon
and that he could get surgery afterward.

490
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,127
When will he be discharged?

491
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,339
I need to perform
an abdominal ultrasound first.

492
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,008
You can't take the patient
in this condition.

493
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,721
Then I'll proceed
with the abdominal ultrasound.

494
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,139
Okay.

495
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,812
Are you okay?

496
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,150
ONLY ONE GUARDIAN ALLOWED
IN THE TREATMENT ROOM

497
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,739
I'll put this down first.

498
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
Good.

499
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,159
There.

500
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,376
I've lost my touch, huh?

501
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,587
Damn it!

502
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,005
No good.

503
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,684
Bring the kids immediately.

504
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,772
Well, they reported back to me,
and his condition--

505
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,399
You think I care about that?

506
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,734
This is the last chance.

507
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,456
Don't they eat at all?

508
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,124
They're at it again.

509
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,794
Hey, Seong-u.

510
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,631
-Yes, ma'am.
-Make sure the rice is al dente.

511
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,966
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

512
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,718
-Hey, Pang.
-Yes, ma'am!

513
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,970
You know the aged sesame?

514
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,055
-I didn't catch that.
-The aged sesame, dude!

515
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,724
-Yes?
-Mix it in all at once.

516
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,480
Attention, Support Platoon.

517
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,814
Attention!

518
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,734
We're on today's night shift
starting at 1900 hours.

519
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,571
Ji-myeong! Today's code words?

520
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,489
Happiness, Shilla.

521
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,074
-Correct, you all memorized it, right?
-Yes!

522
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,910
Sir, we have no bullets in our mags.

523
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,244
Just hit them with the mag.

524
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,246
Why are we on guard duty with no bullets?

525
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,332
Hey, forget it. Let's just go.

526
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,167
-Let's go now.
-Yes, sir!

527
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,168
Gather outside!

528
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,753
We get no ammunition?

529
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,588
Then how do we perform guard duty?

530
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,591
You're connected.

531
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,094
This is Kang
of the Combat Support Company.

532
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,096
Helicopters have been patrolling
for days--

533
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,766
The command oversees
all matters related to the US forces.

534
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,351
Are you disobeying your orders?

535
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,354
I'm not complaining
about the tightened security.

536
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,522
Who is it?

537
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,856
Capt. Kang In-a, sir.

538
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,610
It's causing anxiety among the public.
Some information must be shared--

539
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,279
This information cannot be shared
with a lower-level unit.

540
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,784
Right now, civilians are--

541
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,919
They're not going to tell us anything.

542
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,088
Are we just--

543
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,881
Give them some late-night snacks.

544
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,802
Take a look around the US base
while you're at it.

545
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,721
Understood.

546
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,911
I'm at the church.

547
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,521
Ma'am.

548
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:28,981
Yes.

549
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,733
What brings you here?

550
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,361
I'm Lt. Kim Min-ji
of the Combat Support Company.

551
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,490
I heard you were working 24 hours.
Would you like some snacks?

552
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,453
We had some left at our unit,
so I brought them here.

553
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,544
Snacks are here!

554
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,087
Snacks!

555
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,714
Enjoy.

556
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,300
-Hurry!
-Rice balls!

557
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,114
Take this cord
to that walkie-talkie over there.

558
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,078
The time and place
of the escape is unknown, but…

559
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,955
The training center, the country house…

560
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,834
The US airbase is the best place
to use planes.

561
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,171
But the boarding location could change.

562
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,548
Father Baek said…

563
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,554
that he would come for Yun-sang
one hour before takeoff.

564
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,641
-Yun-sang?
-Yeah.

565
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,435
He said Yun-sang was important
for the escape.

566
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,399
What if it's not the US military base?

567
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,693
They might use a private plane.

568
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,610
Wait.

569
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,197
If it's one hour
from where Father Baek is…

570
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,701
There's an emergency airstrip nearby,

571
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,246
big enough for military transport aircraft
and small private aircraft.

572
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,498
So the US base could just be a trick.

573
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,625
Yeah, that's what we have on the location.

574
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,379
Father Baek should be on the move now,
but there's nothing unusual yet,

575
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,798
not even at the training center.

576
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,261
Sister. Can you check with your informant?

577
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,429
Good idea.

578
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,390
Okay, I'll call you
once we have something.

579
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,642
Okay, let's both be on standby.

580
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,102
You received the thing, right?

581
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,442
Just in case something happens
to Capt. Kang.

582
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,736
Got it. We'll keep it on all night.

583
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,780
They won't attack a church
that's not even holding Mass.

584
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,616
Capt. Kang, get some shuteye.

585
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,494
I'll ask the informant.

586
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,999
Sung-jae.

587
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,459
Father Baek--

588
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,376
Yun-sang.

589
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,422
Go home with Se-kyung and rest.

590
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,507
Let's switch at dawn.

591
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,075
Hey, So-min.

592
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,828
You're going to see Ha-yul, right?

593
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,624
Take some of the pickled radish
that she liked.

594
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,963
Here, give this to her.

595
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,465
Take some dried seaweed too.

596
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,050
Auntie, where are you?

597
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,886
Hey, Auntie's right here.

598
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,393
What? Are you going to sleep here?

599
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,901
Don't you have something to tell me?

600
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,920
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

601
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,767
What are you going to do?

602
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,314
Don't talk like it doesn't involve you.

603
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,276
But it doesn't.

604
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,614
This is about you.

605
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,201
It's something that only you can do.

606
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,453
But you are what I need!

607
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,371
Exactly.

608
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,915
That's what I am to you.

609
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,209
Something you need.

610
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,881
To you, I'm just something
that takes up a corner in your painting

611
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,050
like a flower or a tree.

612
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,803
Just something you need.

613
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,227
Se-kyung.

614
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,272
Why are you playing word games?
That doesn't lead anywhere.

615
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,778
How could I ever leave you behind?

616
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,323
Don't let a crazy bitch like me
drag you to a meaningless death.

617
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,616
Just go!

618
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,535
-Se-kyung.
-What?

619
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,745
Why do you keep trying to abandon me?

620
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,749
Yun-sang.

621
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,251
Yun-sang. Sit down.

622
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,794
I…

623
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,680
I won't be happy.

624
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,728
What they did to my students…

625
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,690
It haunts me every day.

626
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,735
I can't go on living like this.

627
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,990
Only three managed to survive.

628
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,660
I just wanted them to be safe

629
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,498
and live the rest of their lives
with dignity,

630
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,544
without being exploited or threatened
until the last day.

631
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,255
That's why I took those scumbags' lives.

632
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,759
It was what I had to do.

633
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,230
I wondered if it was you.

634
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,900
Did you really…

635
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,071
How could you, Se-kyung?

636
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,790
Do you really believe
that they don't know what you did?

637
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:25,874
They probably do.

638
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,335
They know.

639
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,172
But they can't do anything because of you.

640
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,610
I want you…

641
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,700
to take the last three kids…

642
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,247
from my class

643
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,834
and get them to safety.

644
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,712
Am I being too selfish?

645
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,175
You think they'll want to come with me?

646
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,261
You can take good care of them.

647
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,472
You'll be treated well
because of your skills.

648
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,144
You'll be able to support them
until they're adults.

649
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:34,442
It's sad that they'll be separated
from their families at an early age,

650
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,405
but their parents will trust you.

651
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,867
They'll let them go with you.

652
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,374
You're being too cruel!

653
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,585
So cruel.

654
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,336
This idea is the only part of me…

655
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,923
that isn't horrible.

656
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,659
Yun-sang.
