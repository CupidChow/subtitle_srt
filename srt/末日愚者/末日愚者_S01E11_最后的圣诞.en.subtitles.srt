1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,091
Help those in need.

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,259
It's pretty here.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,678
Please share your kindness and warmth.

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,681
Wait, it's slippery here.
Hey, stop right there!

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,434
Help those in need.

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,603
Help those in need.

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,776
62 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,778
Have a happy Christmas, everyone.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,613
Hello!

10
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,956
There really isn't much time left.

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,208
Are you scared?

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,295
No.

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,173
Kind of looking forward to it.

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,133
The asteroid?

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,262
Yeah. It'll go, "Ta-da,"
and show up in the night sky.

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,389
I don't want to miss that.

17
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,022
Where's Ha-yul?

18
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,983
Oh, I think she's asleep.

19
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,330
Are you going to stay together to the end?

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,750
Of course. The three of us
will be together no matter what.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,378
Yes, and when the asteroid comes,
Min-ho will be with us too.

22
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,256
-Hae-chan.
-Yeah?

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,550
What will I get for Christmas this year?

24
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,679
Santa Claus is still around, right?

25
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,391
Stuff like that doesn't exist now.

26
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,357
No, that's not true.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,651
Santa Claus may not be around,
but Mrs. Claus is.

28
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,238
She's going to bring you a gift, okay?

29
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,176
Why are you standing there like that?

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,557
Aren't you cold? It's cold out here.

31
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,978
I was just thinking about
how we're having a good time by ourselves.

32
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,240
Mi-ryeong.

33
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,292
Let's say goodbye to Min-ho.

34
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,316

FLOATING BUNKER PRESENTATION

46
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,645
Grandma!

47
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,982
Grandma!

48
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,817
Yun-sang, help.

49
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,611
Careful.

50
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,405
Hey!

51
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,614
-Grandma!
-Put it down.

52
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,409
Grandma!

53
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,038
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,832
Grandma.

55
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,501
Look at you.

56
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,756
Ms. Jin?

57
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,675
Se-kyung, where are you?

58
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,010
Jin Se-kyung!

59
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,888
You're barefoot!

60
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,307
Here, let's put these on her.

61
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,392
My goodness, Ms. Kim!

62
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,561
Oh dear, this is terrible!

63
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,063
Her feet are freezing.

64
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,069
Goodness gracious.
Father, you're here too?

65
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,403
Oh my.

66
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,743
Thank you.

67
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:13,289
I need to ask Ms. Jin for an urgent favor.

68
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,253
Just give her a piggyback ride,
and she becomes a little angel.

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,179
They are an evil bunch!

70
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,681
They need to be punished!

71
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,850
They should never be forgiven.

72
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,603
Se-kyung, let's go catch them.

73
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,730
-Yes, let's do that.
-Let's go.

74
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,358
But, Ms. Kim? Not now. Later.

75
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,492
Se-kyung, has your grandmother
sent me this month's interest?

76
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,745
I have to check my bank account.

77
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,123
What are you talking about?

78
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,252
That matter was all settled
when Se-kyung's grandmother passed away.

79
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,631
Grandma. Pull yourself together!

80
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,676
What is this?

81
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,761
This? Whiskey.

82
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,179
Is she okay to drink it?

83
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,182
She's been having it
since before her fainting spells started.

84
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:18,479
When I emptied the storeroom here,
I kept a couple of bottles for her.

85
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,957
Drinking this
tends to help her fall asleep.

86
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,798
What are you doing, Se-kyung?

87
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,051
We have to go catch them.

88
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,972
That brat is not my son.

89
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,225
Se-kyung,

90
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,897
you'll catch him and have him

91
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,150
kneel before me, won't you?

92
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,265
If you just die like this…

93
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,603
you won't be able to ask for forgiveness

94
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,898
from all the people you've hurt.

95
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,696
I'm sick of you,

96
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,325
and I resent you.

97
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,830
I was ashamed to maintain
my position as a priest,

98
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,708
so I quit.

99
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,465
Since you've managed
to hold on to your dear life…

100
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,637
you should consider this your opportunity…

101
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,974
to ask for forgiveness.

102
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,437
Please…

103
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,442
save us all from embarrassment.

104
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,250
THE CHURCH IS CURRENTLY WITHOUT A PRIEST

105
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,335
PLEASE CONTACT THE CATHEDRAL
FOR CONFESSIONS

106
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,253
I'm coming.

107
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,505
Here we go. Careful!

108
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,805
Why does Ms. Jin have to deal with
hearing the same thing over and over?

109
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,642
I bet my daughter won't even bat an eye
if something happens to me.

110
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,186
Not that I don't deserve it.

111
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,440
But I'm still her mother.

112
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,698
Shouldn't the church do its part
at a time like this?

113
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,077
We have the annual confession
to hold at Christmas.

114
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,498
Father.

115
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,046
I went to the cathedral to confess…
but couldn't because it was too crowded.

116
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,091
Why not talk directly to the Lord?

117
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,344
That's the best way.

118
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,064
Where are you going? Come and eat.

119
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,066
I don't want to.

120
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,403
Suit yourself.

121
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,575
Why don't you look for your dad
while you're out?

122
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,327
He's your husband. You find him.

123
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,802
You really signed the agreement?

124
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,763
Man, what were you thinking?

125
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,766
You might get sold off without a trace.

126
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,851
I won't lose.

127
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,854
I just need to focus
and calculate the odds.

128
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,025
Those guys live and breathe this life.
Don't you know that?

129
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,697
I can do this.
After all, I'm Jeong Su-geun.

130
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,699
They even go after the children.

131
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,242
Wait, you have a daughter.

132
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,954
Okay.

133
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,291
Don't jinx it!

134
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,253
Mr. Jeong, go get 'em!

135
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,468
Deal me in.

136
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,850
All done!

137
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,606
You two shouldn't wander around alone.

138
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,858
You be careful too.

139
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,152
Why? Is someone gonna take us away?

140
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,903
No, just in case.

141
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,864
-So-min.
-Yes?

142
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,031
Ta-da!

143
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,908
You're giving me this?

144
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,785
It's your Christmas present.

145
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,498
Thank you.

146
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,010
Hey! Did you see that?

147
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,054
All right,
we're having instant noodles today!

148
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,432
Come on. Hey!

149
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,064
Job done for the day, ma'am.

150
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,609
How many? Did you bring their belongings?

151
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,652
Yes. A total of 18 unidentified bodies.

152
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,205
Why run and make yourself hungry?

153
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,082
I'm running because I'm hungry, all right?

154
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,511
Captain, do you have any ideas
for a special Christmas meal?

155
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,141
The boys want to set traps on the mountain
so we can catch some rabbits to eat.

156
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,893
Let's not do that.

157
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,231
Oh, and we should watch out
for the chickens.

158
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,900
The entire neighborhood is after them.

159
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,653
I'll try to get something.

160
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,450
Right, your mother came by earlier.

161
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,410
Whose mom?

162
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,287
My mom?

163
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,248
Yes, your mom.

164
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,427
What's gotten into you?
You never come home.

165
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,556
I'm too tired to bicker with you.

166
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,643
Give me your laundry.
I'll wash it with the rest.

167
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,144
It's fine. I'll do it.

168
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,194
Hey!

169
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,990
Do you really have to be so cold
at a time like this?

170
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,700
"A time like this"?

171
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,578
You don't think I know?
You're a sitting duck!

172
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,580
They'll want you
to take the blame for that day.

173
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,541
Why didn't you just stay put?

174
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,918
You might really get fired over this!

175
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
I'm leaving.

176
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,924
Hey, what are you… What is wrong with you?

177
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,389
Hey.

178
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,144
After the uproar over the escape,
I thought you'd end up jobless like me,

179
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,605
but you seem fine.

180
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,568
No one is fine.

181
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,072
In-a.

182
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
Is something wrong?

183
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,665
-Hey.
-Hey.

184
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,253
Why does Ms. Kim always have
so much to say?

185
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,425
She just curses out her son
and Father Baek.

186
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,346
Her son was
the most important person in her life.

187
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,057
She must've fallen asleep early today.

188
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,226
She seems to be drinking. Whiskey.

189
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,025
I think that's the solution
Jeong-sun found.

190
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,570
All hospitals and facilities
are out of medical supplies,

191
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,238
so I guess that's one solution.

192
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,116
This isn't good.

193
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,869
It's winter. The flu might go around.

194
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,916
Isn't this funny?

195
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,880
We've gone through a pandemic, riots,
and even a civil war and survived.

196
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,633
Yet a simple cold might kill us all.

197
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,456
Father Baek keeps weighing on my mind.

198
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,046
You know what I think?

199
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,091
We can try to make him pay,

200
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,302
but he's given us so much.

201
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,974
"This isn't how I want to meet the end!"

202
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,352
Something like that.

203
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,354
That's how I feel.

204
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,026
Sure. At one point,
he was like a father to everyone.

205
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,447
He was like that with me.
And he helped a lot of misguided kids.

206
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,952
But if you think about what he did
to everyone else,

207
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,954
it's ridiculous to speak well of him.

208
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
That's also true.

209
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,545
I can't forget what Gye Hyang confessed.

210
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,299
How she donated her hard-earned money
to the extension funds.

211
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,675
It's killing me.

212
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:34,970
How about you?

213
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,264
For me,

214
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,395
I remember when he told me
that he knew I liked women.

215
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,232
He said if I couldn't change it,
I should quietly live a life of service.

216
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,906
I should've punched him there and then.

217
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,366
I was done with him and my mom then.

218
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,582
Still, you should be glad she's healthy.
Resolve things while you can.

219
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,751
There's not much time left.

220
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,253
Hey, forget it.

221
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,923
Okay.

222
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,263
How cute.

223
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
Hi!

224
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,769
Hello there.

225
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,357
Wow, I wonder who made that.

226
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,076
What is it? You can't fall asleep?

227
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,955
Yeah.

228
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,043
Should we have a cup of tea?

229
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,301
Why?

230
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,055
Do you have something to say?

231
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,065
I can't grab on.

232
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,322
To what?

233
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,908
Me?

234
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,827
Yeah.

235
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,579
You wanted to grab onto me?

236
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,914
Yeah.

237
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,337
Just think happy thoughts.

238
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,761
What happy thoughts do you think of?

239
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,443
The world crashing down
to its end right now.

240
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,948
Sixty days.

241
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,951
It's longer than we think.

242
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,373
How is that a happy thought?

243
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:20,135
I also think about
only the good people surviving.

244
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,147
Come here.

245
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,825
I think I made a good choice.

246
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,420
Staying with you.

247
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,690
I want…

248
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,532
to be Jin Se-kyung's husband
for all eternity.

249
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,539
I'd love that.

250
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,151
-When are they coming?
-I know, right?

251
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,902
Hey.

252
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,488
-What is it?
-What?

253
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,158
Did you two fight again?

254
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,076
-Seriously.
-What is it this time?

255
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,994
I mean…

256
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,081
What's wrong?

257
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,166
Look at this.

258
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,419
"Marriage certificate"?

259
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,920
What, finally?

260
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,173
-Husband!
-And wife!

261
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,091
At your service!

262
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,678
Se-kyung, Yun-sang, congratulations!

263
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,599
Who's married now?

264
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,101
Who's now husband and wife?

265
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,770
What are you doing here?

266
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,021
-You're married?
-Wait!

267
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,606
When did you get here?

268
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,025
You're married, then? You got married?

269
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,026
Yeah!

270
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,111
-Hi!
-This is amazing!

271
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,295
60 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

272
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,631
I was in the 26th Regiment
during the Korean War.

273
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,548
Thank you.

274
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,134
-I fought in the Battle of Baegamsan.
-Okay. Sir?

275
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,302
How old are you?

276
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,388
Do you have any idea how fierce it was?

277
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,392
Sir, could you please give me the photos
you brought with you?

278
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,560
-Back then, I was 18 years old.
-Here.

279
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,312
-I have the photos now.
-Sir?

280
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,815
How old are you this year?

281
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,732
-Me?
-Yes.

282
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,319
-I was born in the year of Byeongja.
-Hello.

283
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,489
-He's 87.
-Okay.

284
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,075
Fill out the application
and give me the materials.

285
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,743
Here you go.

286
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,960
You came here early.

287
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,671
Well, I have nothing else to do.

288
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,509
Thanks.

289
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,012
MY LIFE
PARK JIN-SEO

290
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,889
The more material I have,
the easier it is.

291
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,015
Good.

292
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,851
TYPE OF MATERIAL: PHOTOGRAPHS

293
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,019
I haven't seen you much since it got cold.

294
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,855
How are your friends?

295
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,481
So-min and…

296
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,399
Ha-yul.

297
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,360
Yeah, the trio.

298
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,700
Not always.

299
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,836
Hey, isn't it annoying
to hang out together all the time?

300
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,760
About this project,

301
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,514
I get why we're leaving the record,
but what do you do with it?

302
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,141
We send it everywhere we can.

303
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:41,271
If we send them to our sister cities,
they might hang your photos in a museum.

304
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,566
Oh, you mean the cities that survive?

305
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,823
I should've picked better ones.

306
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,335
The heart's beating just fine.

307
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,176
But there's nothing we can do for now.

308
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,105
Don't get lost in your thoughts.
Just eat well. Whatever you can.

309
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,197
Hi, Young-ji.

310
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,199
Young-ji, hi!

311
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,700
Hello.

312
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,792
I know her.

313
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,419
She's pregnant.

314
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,967
Isn't your brother getting any better?

315
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,884
No.

316
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,470
His fever won't go down.

317
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,140
-And his medicine?
-They ran out ages ago.

318
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,476
What do we do?

319
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:07,941
There's no way we'd be able to get
the antibiotics that Young-han needs.

320
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,196
Miss, I heard that your little brother
Young-han is sick.

321
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,491
Yeah.

322
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,452
Huh?

323
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,789
Wait, do you

324
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,208
recognize me?

325
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,086
I did the minute I saw you.

326
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,464
The boy from Ulsan.

327
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,301
Really? You knew?

328
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,013
I should've thanked you, but I couldn't.

329
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,684
We couldn't meet, and things were hectic.

330
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,313
No, it's okay.

331
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
Can you be away from your post?

332
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,321
Only for a moment.

333
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,238
Na Hyeon-jae!

334
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,241
Yes, I'm coming!

335
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,376
Can we see each other again?

336
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,380
Yeah.

337
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,841
Really?

338
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,636
I'll see you, then!

339
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,081
His fever won't go down.

340
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,292
Young-han, I know it's cold,
but bear with me.

341
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,171
You need to drink water. One second.

342
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,592
Does it hurt? Get up just a little.

343
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,937
You couldn't get the medicine?

344
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,398
No.

345
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,161
-We haven't seen Ha-yul for a while.
-You're gonna look for her?

346
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,495
Yeah.

347
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,582
What is that?

348
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,499
What?

349
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,880
Biscuits. You can have them.
I already ate some.

350
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,428
I haven't had these in ages.
But where will you go?

351
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,306
Let's try her house first.

352
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,868
What? Who's this?

353
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,661
Come on, you know me.

354
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,622
-Take it easy, punk.
-What did you say?

355
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,457
You know me. Hey.

356
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,710
I'm Jeong Su-geun!

357
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,170
I do know you, Mr. Jeong.

358
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,507
I have a ton of gold at home.

359
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,591
Gold bars!

360
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,385
My in-laws ran a jewelry shop!

361
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,847
Seriously, I'll pay you back soon.

362
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,225
Hey, you know that.

363
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,936
I'm sure of it this time.

364
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,356
I'll sign another agreement if you want.

365
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,440
Agreement?

366
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,610
You should. So what will it be?

367
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,033
Your kid sure takes after you,
doesn't she?

368
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,167
You're being a clown.

369
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,171
Idiot.

370
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,258
Is that even real?

371
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:54,018
JIN-SEO: HA-YUL, PICK UP YOUR PHONE.
I'M OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE WITH SO-MIN

372
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,356
SO-MIN: WHERE ARE YOU? I MISS YOU!
PLEASE SHOW UP

373
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,472
Put on a mask and gloves before going in.

374
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,557
-Okay.
-Yes, ma'am.

375
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,362
My dear.

376
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,955
Goodness, so she was here.

377
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,090
I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA
MERRY CHRISTMAS

378
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,639
She must've been so sad
she didn't get to see her family.

379
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,016
I'm not sure.

380
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,727
She might not have wanted them
to witness her death.

381
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,563
Don't say that.

382
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,962
This won't work.

383
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,881
We should wrap the cover around her.

384
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,592
I shouldn't have come.

385
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
Nonsense.

386
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,930
Grab that side, please.

387
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,967
It's cold. What are you doing here?

388
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,346
I heard that the rations were delayed,
so I was worried.

389
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,557
I used to be
in the special forces, you know.

390
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,934
Can't a mother worry about her daughter?

391
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,898
Let's talk later. Go home.

392
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,150
Hey, In-a.

393
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,776
What?

394
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,696
Can you see me
now that you're about to die?

395
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,157
Or is it because In-seong is gone?

396
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,325
How could you? Hey!

397
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,285
In-a…

398
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,953
Okay.

399
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,705
Okay, I'm sorry.

400
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,291
I am.

401
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,377
As you know,

402
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,882
your brother always had me worried.

403
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,886
You're the one I depended on.

404
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,766
I thought you would understand me
without me having to tell you.

405
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,521
You always knew how to behave.
Maybe because you're a daughter.

406
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,817
The whole neighborhood knew
what a good daughter you were.

407
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,656
Can't you imagine what a little kid
had to go through to act like that?

408
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,542
You were always running to the school
and the police station for In-seong.

409
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,545
To me, you were so…

410
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,468
You would be in tears,
pretending to kill yourself

411
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,470
so In-seong would start behaving!

412
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,558
And then you'd vent it out on me.

413
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,854
You'd scold the little girl
you left home alone

414
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,147
for not feeding herself.

415
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,322
Do you know how scared I was?

416
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,796
But as I got older…

417
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,802
all of that became
ridiculous and disgusting.

418
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,141
I know you devoted yourself to church work

419
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:47,478
so that In-seong would be met with fortune
and become a son you could be proud of.

420
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,690
Just be the way you always have been!

421
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,067
Fine.

422
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,570
Okay.

423
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,699
But, In-a, it's only me and you now, so--

424
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,285
Would you be like this
if the world wasn't ending?

425
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,590
Go home.

426
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,760
It's late. I'll drop by if I can.

427
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,848
In-a, I'll be waiting! In-a…

428
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,945
Ms. Kim!

429
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,114
I'm here. Where are…

430
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,583
Ms. Kim!

431
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,751
Grandma!

432
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,127
Ms. Kim!

433
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,129
Grandma!

434
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,549
Grandma, where are you?

435
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,136
Grandma!

436
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,054
Over here!

437
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,142
Ms. Kim! Please!

438
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,810
Ms. Kim!

439
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,565
-Put this on first.
-Why are you so late?

440
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,235
Why are you sitting out here?

441
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,195
Left arm.

442
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,863
Put your hand in. Let's go.

443
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,953
You really don't listen.
You want a piggyback ride, right?

444
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,205
Yeah.

445
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,142
Man, I'm hungry.

446
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,520
-I'm going.
-Hey, no.

447
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,232
Why not? I'm leaving.

448
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,443
But we have to see Ha-yul.

449
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,529
Come on.

450
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,198
-Hey! It's Ms. Jin.
-What?

451
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,792
Ms. Kim.

452
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,713
How long are you going to make
people suffer?

453
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,674
Am I heavy?

454
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,136
You're really heavy.

455
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,807
My life is a pain as it is.

456
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,977
Why are you making things worse?

457
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,398
Is someone being a pain in the neck?

458
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:45,364
Bastards no better than cockroaches
keep crawling out of places.

459
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,700
But I know.

460
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,911
Killing one or two
won't solve the problem.

461
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,917
Goodness,
you still have to kill cockroaches.

462
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,753
You can't just leave them.

463
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,049
Everyone tells me not to kill them.

464
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,969
They all try to stop me,
worrying that I might die.

465
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,265
Don't die.

466
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,602
You're such a lovely girl.

467
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,962
-Hey, Ha-yul!
-Ha-yul!

468
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,675
Where have you been?

469
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,135
Yeah, where were you?

470
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,888
We promised to be together to the end.

471
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,141
-We waited all day.
-Oh dear.

472
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,357
Let's go.

473
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,736
-What's wrong?
-The asteroid's coming.

474
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,321
You don't even have a plan!

475
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,075
We have a baby, so I'm happy.
What else should I be?

476
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,912
Yeah, exactly.
How nice it would be for you.

477
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,997
You can just be happy about it!

478
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,833
Ji-eun… No.

479
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,584
Wait a minute!

480
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,295
Ji-eun, wait! Listen to me!

481
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm sorry, but I really don't know
what I've done wrong here.

482
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,178
-No, wait!
-Let go.

483
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,849
-Let go of me.
-Fine, don't get mad. Okay.

484
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,186
I've suffered for ten years!

485
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,273
Your mother and everyone around her

486
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,818
would meddle in everything I do
and treat me like I'm a problem!

487
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,530
I'm so sick and tired of myself.

488
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:55,244
-What are we going to do about the baby?
-Hey, stop! Don't do that!

489
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,996
I'm the problem again!

490
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,249
No. Why would you say that?
You're not the problem!

491
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,296
Don't get mad, okay?

492
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,340
It's not good for our baby.

493
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,219
Hey!

494
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,223
-Just die!
-Wait!

495
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,018
Don't just stand there!

496
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,187
Hey!

497
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,105
Get off!

498
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:27,443
You two should be nice to each other.
What's all this fuss about?

499
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,696
What are you all looking at?
Go home, people!

500
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,531
Close your window!

501
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,201
-They're fighting!
-Stop staring and go!

502
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,912
Hae-chan, Woo-chan,
this isn't a fight, okay?

503
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,248
Did the baby like it?

504
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,169
Offer yourself up again.
The baby needs it.

505
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,755
I told you to grab and twist his hair.

506
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,423
Okay, now. Pull!

507
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,258
Give him a tug!

508
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,594
That's right. Twist it!

509
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,181
Hey, they're not fighting,
so go on your way.

510
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,891
Was that enough?

511
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,188
It's good that you feel better,
but look at this guy's hair.

512
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,242
Hae-chan, Woo-chan, let's go home.

513
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,207
Move, Young-ji.

514
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,291
Move aside!

515
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,404
Doctor.

516
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,741
What's wrong with Young-han?

517
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,580
What's wrong with him?

518
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,086
Please save Young-han!

519
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,509
Calm down, or he won't leave in peace!

520
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,216
I'm sorry.

521
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,928
Stop crying.

522
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,186
Are you crazy?

523
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,690
Honey, who are these people?

524
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,526
Sit down.

525
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,155
Honey.

526
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,658
You should take a look at this first.

527
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,535
Hey, find her.

528
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,913
We gotta find his girl.

529
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,751
AGREEMENT
I HAVE RECEIVED A LOAN OF 800 MILLION WON

530
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,087
Hey, check every corner.

531
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,300
I, JEONG SU-GEUN, WAIVE MY RIGHTS
TO MY BODY AND THAT OF MY DAUGHTER

532
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,637
You crazy bastard.

533
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,222
You call yourself a human?

534
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,726
Do you? How could you do this to us?

535
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:34,440
Why can't you ever live a decent life?

536
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,110
Get out! Leave!

537
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,696
Go kill yourself!

538
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,588
FEBRUARY 22, 2026
A PLACE WITHOUT HOPE IS HELL

539
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,127
BYE, YOUNG-HAN, SEE YOU SOON
YOUNG-HAN, HAVE FUN WITH TAE-MI

540
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,966
Hey, let's go.

541
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,260
Let's wait for Ha-yul.

542
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,920
"We now bury the bodies of our brothers
and sisters according to our customs."

543
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:25,467
"Dear Lord, we pray today,
as did the saints,

544
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:30,347
that you will bring to pass
the resurrection of these souls

545
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,184
and let them stand
in the company of the saints."

546
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,354
"Please have mercy in judgment."

547
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,068
"Deliver them from death and sin
so they may reconcile with the Father."

548
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,446
"Let these souls follow you,
the kind shepherd,

549
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,950
the eternal king,
to the place of endless joy,

550
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,202
where the saints await them."

551
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,289
Together we pray.

552
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,472
Jeong Ha-yul, let's go!

553
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,182
Ha-yul!

554
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,767
Who are you?

555
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,736
Hey, shut up!

556
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:29,031
Is there a priest here? Father?

557
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,825
Father?

558
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,332
You're not a priest.

559
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,291
Hey, Sister.

560
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,960
We're having a Mass.

561
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,088
-Please leave.
-Leave.

562
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,340
A Mass, you say?

563
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,301
Who are you people?

564
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,221
-Are you insane?
-Find her!

565
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,182
Hey, find her.

566
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,350
Over there!

567
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:57,976
Get her!

568
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,857
Sit down. Let's hide here.

569
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,086
Move!

570
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,340
Ms. Jin.

571
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,467
Ms. Jin.

572
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,281
Run away! Hurry!

573
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,044
Who are you? Let me go!

574
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,212
You bastard!

575
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,575
In-a!

576
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,243
In-a.

577
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,206
You're out of control, aren't you?

578
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,792
Ha-yul…

579
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,879
Ha-yul was in danger.

580
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,964
We all knew that.

581
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,352
Where did you get the gun?

582
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,771
Who cares…

583
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,483
where I got it?

584
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,614
You're right.

585
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,741
It doesn't matter now.

586
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,453
I couldn't

587
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,791
think about anything.

588
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,130
Just like you said…

589
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,552
I think I've lost my mind.

590
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,898
You need to calm down first.

591
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:36,987
The gun.

592
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,156
Okay.

593
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,511
Take her home.

594
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,472
Do not let her outside.

595
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,268
-Okay.
-I'll make sure no one talks.

596
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,420
You're okay.

597
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,642
It's all right.

598
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:57,651
