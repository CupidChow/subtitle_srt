00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,151
Dear Lord,

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,404
please give me strength today

15
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,909
so I may deliver your grace
to your believers.

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,581
So I may…

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,007
To be honest,
I want to get rid of all that stuff.

18
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,265
This is the Martial Law Command.

19
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,267
The curfew has been lifted.

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,644
189 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

21
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,856
The current time and date
is 05:00, August 17, 2025.

22
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,528
Where have you been?

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,697
I just went out for a walk.

24
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,159
Father, I put your vestments in your room.

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,244
Thank you.

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,722
Hello, Sister.

27
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,895
Sister?

28
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,398
I may not be religious, but let me.

29
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,482
Oh, thank you.

30
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,484
It's quite heavy.

31
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,739
This one too.

32
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,325
One, two…

33
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,125
Well,

34
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,502
is there

35
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,965
anything I can help you with?

36
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,888
How wonderful.
We need all the help we can get.

37
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,805
Thank you so much.

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,348
Follow me.

39
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:14,736
Born as a valiant son of this nation

40
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,656
We walk this proud path
To protect our homeland…

41
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,868
Hey, you were an idol star.
Were fangirls freaking easy to score with?

42
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,955
Oh, right. You weren't that famous.

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,625
I guess that only applies
to the A-listers.

44
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,461
Please stop, sir.
I'm not comfortable hearing this.

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,129
Don't bullshit me, kid!

46
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,466
With your looks,
I'm sure you were surrounded by chicks.

47
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,051
I bet they said, "Oppa!"

48
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,098
If you have any videos of the bitches,
share the love.

49
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,560
-Fucking bastard.
-I said stop!

50
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,478
Son of a bitch!

51
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,564
Fucker! Look at this asshole.

52
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,565
Let go!

53
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,611
-Hey!
-Stop them!

54
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,572
You fucker! Let go of me!

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,074
Stop it!

56
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,243
Hey!

57
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,664
Let me go!

58
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,415
Hey!

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,084
Hey!

60
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,336
Goodness.

61
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,137
Let's put them up together.

62
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,976
That's it.

63
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,894
LOOKING FOR MY MOM
OH SEON HYANG, AGE 42

64
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,397
WENT MISSING ON MAY 2, 2025
WHILE LOOKING FOR OUR DOG

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,066
Please let my mom come back to us soon.

66
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,445
-Father.
-Yes?

67
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,363
Father!

68
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,950
It seems that the members of Group 8
got into a car accident.

69
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,454
What? What happened?
Was anyone badly hurt?

70
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,373
They won't get here on time.

71
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,376
The liturgist and the lector
were both in the car.

72
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,710
What do we do?

73
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,046
Aside from the choir members…

74
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,217
Sister, you should do it.

75
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,635
-Me?
-Yes.

76
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,971
I have to take care of you
and the altar boys.

77
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,267
Sister Christina.

78
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,852
Do you mean Mi-ryeong?

79
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,770
Yes.

80
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,608
Do you think she will say yes?
After what happened to Min-ho, she--

81
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,570
She came to confession last time.
She has experience with big events.

82
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,739
-Father, here you are.
-Hello.

83
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,825
Hello, Sister.
Thank you all for your work.

84
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,245
We tried our best to prepare for this.
I hope we didn't miss anything.

85
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,747
Oh, please. You've done a great job.

86
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,167
It's more complicated than I thought.
Maybe we should've used the church.

87
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,503
No, what are you talking about?

88
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,506
This is an event
for all citizens of Woongcheon.

89
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,175
I'm just thankful
that you allowed us to help.

90
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,093
You're welcome.

91
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,511
-I'll leave you to it.
-Okay.

92
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,680
Hello!

93
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,392
Yun-sang, is there anything else
I need to know?

94
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,227
Come on, you'll do great.

95
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,480
-Nervous?
-A little.

96
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,649
-Let me take a picture of you.
-Okay.

97
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,152
-Sister, let's--
-No.

98
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,486
-What?
-No, thank you.

99
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,655
One, two…

100
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,116
Smile a little.

101
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,201
Sure. Kids, smile.

102
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,038
One, two, three.

103
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,585
THE LATE KIM MIN-HO
SEPTEMBER 1, 2011 - MAY 10, 2025

104
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,759
Hi there.

105
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,094
-Hello.
-Hello.

106
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,682
What is this?

107
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,101
Why are there so many bodyguards?

108
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,272
That's just…

109
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,318
Why are you spying on our neighbors?

110
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,822
Trying to make new connections?

111
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,159
What did you say?

112
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,538
Let's go.
You said we'd go to the memorial Mass.

113
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,455
In-tae.

114
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,170
Cho In-tae!

115
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,049
In-tae!

116
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,342
Mother, just get in.

117
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,179
That little brat.

118
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,064
Give us a migration plan!

119
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,149
Give us a migration plan!

120
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,151
We want to live too!

121
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,153
We want to live too!

122
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,072
Guarantee our survival!

123
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,241
Guarantee our survival!

124
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,576
Give us a…

125
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,661
Capt. Kang, this is Im Seon-ju.

126
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,497
Well,

127
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,960
would you be able to provide
security support at the memorial Mass?

128
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,796
I want to help,
but I don't think that'll be possible.

129
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
There's no time.

130
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,009
And we have a problem at our base.

131
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,010
Is that so?

132
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,680
I can only attend on my own.

133
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,182
Then it can't be helped.
I'll see you later.

134
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,269
Okay. I'm sorry.

135
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,186
No worries.

136
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,027
There are about four soldiers
refusing to be discharged.

137
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,781
Even if they leave, they'd have nowhere
to go and no way to make ends meet.

138
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,451
That punk, Kim Hyeon-sik,
does have a bad influence.

139
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,622
When he goes out on guard duty,
he gets to interact with civilians.

140
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,999
He'll continue to cause trouble.

141
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,172
-Take a handout.
-Give us a migration plan!

142
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,090
Give us a migration plan!

143
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,925
We want to live too!

144
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,011
We want to live too!

145
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,390
Wow, look who's here.

146
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,685
He's a big shot from Woongcheon.

147
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,104
A big shot? Who is?

148
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,190
Welcome, sir.

149
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,068
Here's a handout.

150
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,364
He's simply attending at the request
of his elderly mother,

151
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,492
so please keep quiet about this
to avoid any inconvenience.

152
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,369
Yes, I will.

153
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,953
It's a beginning, everyone.

154
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,205
A new beginning!

155
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,836
Don't be fooled, everyone!

156
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,005
The end of the world is a lie!

157
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,491
A reading from the First Epistle of John.

158
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,202
"No one has ever seen God."

159
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,831
Sir, the man with the camera over there
is Dr. Ha Yun-sang.

160
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,332
I'll call him over later.

161
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,250
Yes.

162
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,585
"His love is brought to perfection in us."

163
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,254
This is the word of the Lord.

164
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,590
Thanks be to God.

165
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,564
Countless Woongcheon citizens

166
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,066
have left our side.

167
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,067
Min-ji!

168
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,318
Sang-ho!

169
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,987
Seo-jun!

170
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,036
What do I do without you?

171
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,596
Su-yeon!

172
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,874
What we feel today…

173
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,836
the hatred and the envy of others…

174
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,007
and the agony that comes with it…

175
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,761
are all things we can understand.

176
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,682
The helplessness we feel
after being used and abandoned

177
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,019
devastates our souls, after all.

178
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,396
Understanding

179
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,192
enables us to forgive and reconcile.

180
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,615
There is not much time left.

181
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,536
Everyone, now is the time for forgiveness.

182
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,498
Everyone…

183
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,834
We can't hear you.

184
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,502
The microphone isn't working.

185
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,842
We can't hear you!

186
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,177
Sorry about that. Now is--

187
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,055
What is it? What's the issue?

188
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,473
-Put this on.
-Damn it!

189
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,018
We can't hear you!

190
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,812
Forgive and reconcile?

191
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,733
Forgiveness and reconciliation
can only be achieved with money.

192
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,864
You are all being fooled!

193
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,287
Wait. What is all this?

194
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,204
Everyone.

195
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,748
Everyone, calm down.

196
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,462
The interest rates
were super low back then.

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,594
But it was also a time
when gold prices were quickly rising.

198
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,600
Our dearest Father Baek
took the funds you had all offered

199
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,227
and used it all to buy gold.

200
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,732
Paid fully in cash.

201
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,400
The payment method?

202
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,027
Bank transfer.

203
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,325
Where is Father Baek now?

204
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,161
Reveal your identity,
and tell us everything!

205
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,412
Dear citizens,

206
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,205
the president is gone,

207
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,917
and all the important figures
have gone missing.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,464
Now we don't even have the slightest hope
of being able to migrate to a safe zone.

209
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,132
-Tell us!
-Mother.

210
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,216
Let's go now.

211
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,138
Mr. Cho, you're leaving? I'll…

212
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,058
-Send the unit here.
-Father's…

213
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,731
And how did Father Baek use
all of that gold?

214
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,735
-Where the money went isn't important.
-Father, where are you going?

215
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,403
The important thing is that we--

216
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,867
The corruption seeps out like pus!

217
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,785
Su-geun!

218
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,245
-Where's the money? At the church?
-Su-geun!

219
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,706
Where did the priest go?

220
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,916
Do not be deceived,

221
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,669
not by the wiles of someone
who hides in the--

222
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,887
Hey.

223
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,598
Sit down!

224
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,016
Sit down, everyone!

225
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
Sit down! Sit!

226
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,613
We received a report
of false rumors spreading.

227
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,449
Clause Four, Section Three
of the Martial Law states

228
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,619
that those who spread false rumors
can be detained without a warrant.

229
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,870
Nonsense!

230
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,872
This is a matter of the church!

231
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,458
The same applies
to obstructing an investigation.

232
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,294
-Father.
-Please don't scare them.

233
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,338
There is no need for any of this.

234
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,842
I speak to you as a priest.
Take your investigators and leave.

235
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,428
We can deal with this on our own.

236
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,850
Everyone, let's go to the church!

237
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,018
Let's go!

238
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,477
To the church?

239
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,732
Hey, Su-geun!

240
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
No.

241
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,821
Father!

242
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,739
Father?

243
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,537
Why are the investigators stopping us?
You should be stopping them!

244
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,124
Can't you see
that's a flock of lost sheep?

245
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,670
Let them cry out to God for salvation.
Am I not right, Ms. Deputy Mayor?

246
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,383
Capt. Kang, your soldiers
probably had nothing to do.

247
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,635
Why didn't you provide security support?

248
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,096
Right, your unit is out of bullets.

249
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,267
Sister, what are you doing?
Go with the people. Hurry!

250
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,061
Yun-sang.

251
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,147
You have to decide quickly.
The clock is ticking.

252
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,156
Get lost, will you?

253
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,454
That wasn't just any money.

254
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,290
This is nuts!
Let's go and see for ourselves!

255
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,125
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

256
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,295
-Please calm down. You can't do this.
-Where the hell is Father Baek?

257
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,546
-Su-geun!
-Please.

258
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,965
Just listen to me. Wait, please!

259
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,550
Listen to me. Please…

260
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,821
Wait, Father. Is that…

261
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,791
That wasn't me.

262
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,922
No way! My goodness!

263
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,969
Excuse me.

264
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,974
No.

265
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,326
Father.

266
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,454
Was there anyone inside the church
during the fire?

267
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,165
No.

268
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,084
Everyone was in the city square
for the Mass.

269
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,003
No one could've been in there.

270
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,672
Have you experienced
any short circuits lately?

271
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,925
Not even once.

272
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,928
May I see the church specifications?

273
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,389
Specifications…

274
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,017
I'll bring them to you.

275
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,777
See you again, Dr. Ha.

276
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,415
It doesn't look like
they are behind the mysterious voice.

277
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,169
They have no reason
to interrupt a memorial event.

278
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
Does anyone need a reason?

279
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,885
"It's the end of the world."

280
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,138
"Who cares?"

281
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,310
Maybe it was just a prank.

282
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
-What?
-How badly burned was it?

283
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,994
Look at the puppy's cheeks.

284
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,914
Still, they got the fire under control.
That's such a relief.

285
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,165
But still…

286
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,833
So-min.

287
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,337
Take Hae-chan and Woo-chan
and go home, okay?

288
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,924
The kids want to go with you.
We'll stay nearby.

289
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,968
-Okay.
-The playground?

290
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,219
-Yeah.
-Let's go there.

291
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,470
To the playground.

292
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,930
To the playground!

293
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,432
-You want the swings or the slide?
-Don't go too far.

294
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,517
-Okay.
-So-min.

295
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,893
-Kids, be careful.
-Hae-chan.

296
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,979
-Okay.
-I wanna ride the swings.

297
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,480
-The swings?
-Yeah!

298
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,191
Want me to push you?

299
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,360
Yeah, I ride the swings well.

300
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,778
Let's hurry up.

301
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,530
Hey, it's okay.

302
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,700
They are small, so they don't catch
people's attention too much.

303
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,993
So don't worry.

304
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,207
Hey…

305
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,046
I think I said some things
I shouldn't have during my confession.

306
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,465
Some suspicion might fall on me.

307
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,471
I said I wanted to get the money I offered
for the church extension funds back.

308
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,891
But the fire at the church
has nothing to do with me, okay?

309
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,228
-To be honest…
-Yeah, what?

310
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,650
I said something similar.

311
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,902
What? You did?

312
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,947
Does that mean people will be shouting
for their money back?

313
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,742
Or the fire might make
the whole thing go away.

314
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,369
Hey, that's not fair!

315
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,343
I almost died of embarrassment
because of my dad.

316
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
My mom was probably really shocked too.

317
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,098
It burned even before the asteroid hit.

318
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,018
It was going to burn anyway.

319
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,771
You're right.
Everything will burn on that day.

320
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,814
Do you think Sister Regina is okay?

321
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,067
Hey, Jin-seo is coming. Let's go.

322
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,526
Sure.

323
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,947
You have to be extra careful today, okay?

324
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,074
-Be safe.
-Okay.

325
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,330
I thought something like this

326
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,666
would never happen at a church.

327
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,339
Well, all organizations are the same.

328
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,220
But have you seen
this kind of mess happen before?

329
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,562
Shine the light here.

330
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,939
You idiot,
why did you set the church on fire?

331
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,441
No one was there though.

332
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,609
And no one got hurt!

333
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,365
The safe has to be opened
so we can give people money to escape.

334
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,283
Shut up.

335
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:25,839
What's this room?

336
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,424
Father Baek's storage room.

337
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,426
We don't have the key or the passcode.

338
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,929
We have to check in here as well.
Can we open it?

339
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,307
-No, this is--
-Sure, yes. You can open it.

340
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,392
-Open it, please.
-Okay.

341
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,756
Sister.

342
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,428
This can't be.

343
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,515
This is a fire door,
so it didn't catch on fire.

344
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,274
It seems that the cause
was a faulty circuit breaker.

345
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,153
Well, we confirmed there aren't
any structural integrity issues.

346
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,739
But there still could be some embers.

347
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,700
So?

348
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,286
It doesn't seem like arson.

349
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,040
Who would dare to set a church on fire?

350
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,418
My heart is still pounding.

351
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:52,384
When Namdaemun caught on fire,
they said it wasn't arson at first.

352
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,302
Please, Ms. Kim.

353
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,138
If you set fire to a church,
you'd go to hell.

354
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,683
Your imagination is always so impressive.

355
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,519
Reality always surpasses imagination.

356
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,647
Yes.

357
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,399
That's right.

358
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,360
There's nothing left.

359
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,030
What?

360
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,992
-What?
-What do you mean?

361
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,203
Did the church safe burn to ashes?

362
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,999
-Father!
-Oh my!

363
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,417
Father!

364
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,669
-Oh no.
-What do we do?

365
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,424
This was all the equipment
that was used, right?

366
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,550
Yes.

367
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,928
Other than the people from city hall
and the vendor staff,

368
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,763
did anyone else help?

369
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,432
Sir, you have to take this too.

370
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,267
That's not ours.

371
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,352
-This isn't yours?
-No, it isn't.

372
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
It's not ours, right?

373
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,356
No, that's not ours either.

374
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,735
Wait, what?
Does anyone know where this is from?

375
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,696
This speaker!

376
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,281
What is it?

377
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,577
This doesn't belong to city hall
or the vendor.

378
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,745
What?

379
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,414
-Yun-sang, what is it?
-This belongs to the church.

380
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
Are you okay?

381
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,884
Father.

382
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,471
Why am I…

383
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,889
Are you okay?

384
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,225
Everyone was so startled.

385
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,312
We thought we were losing
the last priest we had.

386
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,022
How could you say that?

387
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,983
Wait.

388
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,318
I'm sorry.

389
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,988
I was just so relieved.

390
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,826
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

391
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,744
Father.

392
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,996
Thank you.

393
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:48,917
Hey, In-a.

394
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,377
Excuse me.

395
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,256
-Drink some water.
-Okay.

396
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,182
When this church was built,

397
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,978
your grandparents gave a huge offering.

398
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,357
That's when they told me

399
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,112
that they would like one
of their three grandsons to be a priest.

400
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,365
So I told them not to hesitate

401
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:25,704
to send their youngest, Sung-jae,
to seminary.

402
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:31,960
Why

403
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,504
was it me?

404
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,885
"Then Samuel asked Jesse,
'Are these all the sons you have?'"

405
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,054
"Jesse replied,

406
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,225
'There is still the youngest,
but he is tending the sheep.'"

407
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,562
"Samuel said to Jesse, 'Send for him.'"

408
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,190
"Jesse had him brought to them.
He was ruddy,

409
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,279
a youth with beautiful eyes,
and good-looking."

410
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,365
"Fallen!"

411
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,493
"Fallen!"

412
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,080
"Fallen is Babylon the Great!"

413
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,166
"Fallen!"

414
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,838
"Fallen is Babylon the Great!"

415
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,216
They ate everything we had.

416
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,011
People need to see
that kind of huge organization fall

417
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,180
to know that the world is changing.

418
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,642
This is how foolish humans are.

419
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,689
I'd like the guys who come here
to bring their own food from now on.

420
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,524
You should share when you can.

421
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,069
Shouldn't a parent at least make sure
their teenage son doesn't starve?

422
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,489
Jin-seo,

423
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,909
the thing about welfare states is that--

424
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,457
You let mosquitoes in here.

425
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,294
Man, I'm hungry.

426
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,725
What a catastrophe.

427
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,728
Who would have even imagined?

428
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,440
So all that money just disappeared?

429
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,570
-Stop it.
-He would say, "Teresa."

430
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,239
"Your faith is unmatched."

431
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,492
Mom, what's the point of money right now?

432
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,495
Money?

433
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,247
Hey.

434
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,084
Money is not the issue here, child.

435
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,168
Then what?

436
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,089
"Where did he run off to
with all that money?"

437
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,424
That's what this is about.

438
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,760
I mean, how could he?

439
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,224
He left behind all these believers,
this flock of sheep,

440
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,060
and made a run for it
just so he could live.

441
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,979
What a catastrophe.

442
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,480
Flock of sheep, my foot.

443
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,943
Why did this have to happen to me?

444
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,241
The world is coming to an end,
and it wants to end me first.

445
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,035
Ha-neul!

446
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,873
Where are you?

447
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,669
You have to come home!

448
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,824
Goodness, this is upsetting.

449
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,743
It is.

450
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,079
You're leaving now?

451
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,249
No, In-a and Yun-sang
told me to wait here.

452
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,668
Capt. Kang? Where is she?

453
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,880
They are at city hall
checking some sound equipment.

454
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,593
Hi.

455
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,844
Hey, give me a hand.

456
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,429
Sister.

457
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,932
I have something I want to ask you.

458
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,019
Does this speaker belong to the church?

459
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,604
Yes, I think so.

460
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,521
Right?

461
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,357
Yeah, I think it does.

462
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,691
We moved it this morning--

463
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,276
I guess I forgot about this.

464
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,694
Thank you so much.

465
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,947
If you connect to it through Bluetooth,

466
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,700
you don't have to be near the speaker

467
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,620
to use it.

468
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,705
So, with this…

469
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,377
I think the anonymous voice
used this speaker.

470
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,129
Sister.

471
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,091
I'm sorry, but I need to see your phone.

472
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,759
My phone?

473
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,843
Yes.

474
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,137
My phone?

475
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,403
You're right.

476
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,279
I put the speaker there!

477
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,038
Then whose voice was that?

478
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,415
I can't tell you.

479
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,624
Sister.

480
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,680
Since Father Woo is here too…

481
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,933
let's be honest.

482
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,895
The church extension funds,
where did that money come from?

483
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,818
It's from people like Sister Teresa,
who saved up her earnings

484
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,904
from driving laborers around the country.

485
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,868
How about massive offerings
from rich members of the church?

486
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,661
Is that any less precious?

487
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,208
They earned their wealth through hardship
or even through heartless means.

488
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
And they were willing
to share that with others!

489
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,881
I thought it was only right to return it.

490
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,842
Sister, how could you even think about…

491
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,095
Dear Lord!

492
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,097
I took the risk of being excommunicated.

493
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,851
Father Baek and the administrator
have both gone missing.

494
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:26,314
Once this goes public,
you'll be responsible for fixing it.

495
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,276
I feel ashamed and despondent.

496
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,990
But then there was a timely fire,

497
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,159
and the downstairs storeroom was opened.

498
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,412
But the safe was empty,

499
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,999
and everything Father Baek loved,
his wine, his chocolate,

500
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,127
and even his cheese were gone!

501
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,129
Seriously!

502
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:55,968
But…

503
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,681
as I dedicated my youth to this church,

504
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,725
I feel responsible.

505
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,274
That's why I owe it to myself

506
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,195
to see how this situation ends,
so that's what I'll do!

507
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,780
Sister.

508
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,907
Sister!

509
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,014
I think…

510
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,020
we need to move up D-day.

511
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,902
Even a small event
tends to excite the public,

512
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,988
which then also
leads to things getting out of hand.

513
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,699
All life on Earth…

514
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,784
I understand.

515
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,370
Let's hurry.

516
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,125
The day of judgment is coming.

517
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,630
There is hope in the end.

518
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,675
You are all
standing in the dominion of salvation.

519
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:05,139
Those who have been saved
will live in a dazzling heaven on earth.

520
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,185
Those who are chosen
will safely board the ark.

521
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,689
Those who are not chosen
will disappear in the floods.

522
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,775
HOLY BIBLE

523
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,539
In-seong.

524
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,834
In-seong.

525
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,426
GOD'S A DICKHEAD

526
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,846
What is this?

527
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,433
FUCK
THIS FUCKING SUCKS

528
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,103
THE ASTEROID KILLED JESUS
YOUR GOD'S A WEAKLING

529
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,729
ASSHOLE GOD
FUCKING CHRIST

530
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,703
So we want to know

531
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,624
where all the money went
when it should be in one place.

532
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,128
Did Father Baek really take it?

533
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,714
Can you see how ridiculous this is?

534
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,465
Father.

535
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,426
I apologize.

536
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,221
We should have held
the memorial Mass at the church.

537
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,307
-I'm really sorry.
-No, it's fine.

538
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,812
Is Sister Chae-hwan not coming?

539
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,607
No, she's not.
She seemed ill, so I told her to rest.

540
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,276
And the fire

541
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,696
was caused by a short circuit.

542
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,158
Well, the building is old.

543
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,828
Father.

544
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,165
About the voice incident yesterday,

545
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,584
do you have any leads?

546
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,002
I'm not sure.

547
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,088
But first, as a priest,

548
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,093
I believe the issues raised by the voice
should not be overlooked.

549
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,554
Yes, that's right.

550
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,183
We must confirm whether it's true or not.

551
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,100
I mean,

552
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,188
the culprit must know something about it.

553
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,689
If we catch the culprit--

554
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,860
To ruin such a meaningful Mass
is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.

555
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,696
A grave offense according to Canon Law.

556
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,697
That's right.

557
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,700
And your son took the time out
to attend with you.

558
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,495
God, you're all so frustrating.

559
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,333
That's not what matters right now.
We have to find the money!

560
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,297
Well, put aside the money.

561
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,884
The good faith of the believers
has gone up in smoke.

562
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,970
Isn't that blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit?

563
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,474
We need to search and seize the ledgers
related to the funds and donations!

564
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,646
I keep thinking about Father Baek.
I can't help it.

565
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,571
Good heavens!

566
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,657
Shit, that scared me.

567
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,086
I know this may sound random,

568
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,715
but I think we should reinforce
the outer walls.

569
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:33,180
We have less than 200 days left,
but to think we have to look at

570
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,518
these burnt and broken walls
during that whole time is a bit…

571
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,107
Even if we have only a day left to live,
we should still keep our stomachs full

572
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,526
and keep our minds happy, no?

573
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,153
On that note,

574
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,240
I have some close plasterer friends
who aren't working these days,

575
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,075
so I spoke to them about this.

576
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,413
We're discussing an important issue here.
Let's talk about that later--

577
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,999
No. What she's saying is important too.

578
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:04,170
That's right. I also feel uncomfortable
to see the church like this.

579
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,130
I'll help too.

580
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,047
Sure.

581
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,638
Why stick your nose in their business?
You have no right!

582
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,183
Think of all the money
we offered to the church!

583
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,100
"We"?

584
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,977
What do you mean "we"?

585
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,272
With what conscience
would you meddle with church matters?

586
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,441
Aren't you ashamed to face Ha-yul?

587
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,652
You embarrass me so much

588
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,405
that I haven't been
anywhere near the church in ages.

589
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,741
But things are different for Ha-yul.

590
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,160
She has her friends and her teacher there.

591
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,995
So it's all my fault again, huh?

592
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,414
Fine, then let's just all die together.

593
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,999
Stop calling the shots for us.

594
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,293
Who do you think you are?
It's not the end yet.

595
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,296
Be honest with me.
Why do you keep going to the church?

596
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,594
You donated to the church behind my back
when Father Baek was around.

597
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,181
He bought gold for himself with the money,
and that pisses me off!

598
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,521
That money was from the account
my parents set up for me.

599
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,439
-It wasn't yours!
-Does that matter?

600
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,192
We have to find it whoever it belongs to!

601
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,528
Enough with your…

602
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,881
Hey, teammate?

603
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,223
What's wrong?

604
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,312
Oh dear, that's becoming a habit, really.

605
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,816
I guess it's because
Min-ho's birthday is coming up.

606
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,569
Yeah?

607
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,701
I know how you'd feel.

608
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:07,001
By the way, there was a meeting
at the church today.

609
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,671
That man, Ha-yul's father, was there too.

610
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:16,385
And he was shouting at Father Woo,
telling him to return the extension funds.

611
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,348
He's just gone a bit crazy right now
because of money.

612
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,893
He's not that special.
We're all going through the same thing.

613
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,231
I, for one, want to just bang my head
against a wall and kill myself.

614
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,030
Hey, cheer up, okay?

615
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,747
-No.
-I'm scared!

616
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,707
There was a fire at Cheondong Church.

617
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,670
I was so upset
to see the church burned black.

618
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,884
Auntie said she would fix the church
with some men.

619
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,848
There are 188 days left.

620
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,559
The days are counting down.

621
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,897
Even scarier things will happen
when the asteroid comes, won't they?

622
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,859
Woo-chan, help me!

623
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,904
No!

624
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,740
Help!

625
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,578
174 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

626
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:31,669
IN-A

627
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,753
Hot.

628
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,122
Hello.

629
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,040
That's right.

630
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,459
You finally came out.

631
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,586
There.

632
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,381
So you're Choco.

633
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,344
Gotcha.

634
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,615
Regarding the recent assault,
we found that both parties were at fault.

635
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,037
Show respect to your fellow soldiers,
or there will be no survival.

636
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:54,084
If this kind of incident occurs again,
you will be punished by military law.

637
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,337
It was Sergeant Kim again, right?

638
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,049
That fucking moron.

639
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,304
I'm gonna destroy him. Fuck.

640
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,099
-Sir.
-Hey.

641
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,103
You're off guard duty for one month
and on cleaning and maintenance duty.

642
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,523
But this was insubordination.

643
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,776
Why do I have to be treated
like I screwed up?

644
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,194
Shut the hell up!

645
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,780
You've got a big mouth
for someone who made a mess.

646
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:24,948
I can't do it.

647
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,786
I may as well be discharged
if I'm gonna be the battalion lackey.

648
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,996
What, you want to be discharged?

649
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,626
Na Hyeon-jae will just
keep going out as a driver.

650
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,585
No, he won't.

651
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,504
What?

652
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,342
Hi, Hyeon-jae.

653
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,762
I asked for you.

654
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:55,103
Our duty is to protect our honored guests
using every means possible.

655
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,188
From whom?

656
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,358
Anyone looking for a chance
to kidnap them.

657
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,109
Hey, come here.

658
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,822
Get over here!

659
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,032
Put those down and come here.

660
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,368
-I'm fine, ma'am.
-What do you mean?

661
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,370
Are you disobeying an order?

662
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,330
-No, ma'am.
-Put them down.

663
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,215
You'll have to be on higher alert
than when you're on guard duty.

664
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,008
Understood, ma'am.

665
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,594
Aren't they so pretty?

666
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,767
Hello, you're all here.

667
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,686
Come.

668
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,524
Yes. Get inside.

669
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,777
If the outer walls are done,
wrap things up.

670
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,946
Let's decide what we'll do inside.

671
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,954
Those men are really skilled, aren't they?

672
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,624
That's right.
In the North, they were special force--

673
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,293
No.

674
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,129
-They were special technicians.
-All right.

675
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,297
Gye Hyang!

676
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,049
Look at this. Good as new, huh?

677
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,344
Just as I expected!
No wonder you get paid so much.

678
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,430
Wait, you're going to pay me?

679
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:15,183
Think of it as volunteer work.
Show some faith to the Lord.

680
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,103
Don't you think you should do
some good deeds before you die?

681
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,938
Gye Hyang, look over here!

682
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,276
These old tiles were hard to get,
so we're a bit short.

683
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,695
Won't it look a bit patchy?

684
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,531
Don't worry about it at all.

685
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,825
It's way better than black soot.

686
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,160
It looks great.

687
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,954
-I got it. Don't worry.
-You said it yourself, okay?

688
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,791
Right, I heard it's chaotic
in North Korea too.

689
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:41,835
Yes.

690
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:48,091
I was this close to saving up enough money
and bringing the rest of my family here.

691
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,092
Yeah?

692
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,637
Hold it right.

693
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,430
It's off-balance.

694
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,808
I can't lift up my arms.
Let's just drag it.

695
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,857
Sister Regina must be in great shock.

696
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,109
Her face is all puffy.

697
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,700
The church is her home,
and she saw it go up in flames.

698
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,036
Sister, are you okay?

699
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,044
People used to come here to take photos
because a famous architect designed it.

700
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,462
Now it looks hideous.

701
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:27,965
Come on!

702
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,426
What's the point in all this scrubbing?

703
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,514
Scrubbing won't fix
what's broken and twisted!

704
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,434
Did it splash on you?

705
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,435
My bad.

706
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,063
You're still down?

707
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,773
Sister!

708
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,235
You should prepare the group meal.

709
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,987
Don't act confused.

710
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,155
Go about your duties calmly
as you always have.

711
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,575
Yes, go about my duties.

712
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,161
Let's go!

713
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,879
I mean, are you all right? You need this?

714
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,844
I'll take care of this. Let me.

715
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,849
The work just doesn't seem to end.

716
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,020
Dear me!

717
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,980
Bishop, this is Father Woo.

718
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:27,733
Yes.

719
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,612
We were told it was an accident.

720
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,074
Yes.

721
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,995
Yes, of course.

722
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,289
Yes.

723
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,627
Well, it wasn't arson, at least.

724
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,422
With all fire insurance suspended,

725
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,258
it doesn't matter what caused the fire.

726
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,471
From the look of things,
the diocese might help us out.

727
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,722
That's right.

728
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,808
They won't turn a blind eye
just because Father Baek's not here.

729
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,978
Do you think the diocese has
some kind of plan in place?

730
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:05,896
Of course!

731
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,024
I don't know what to think anymore.

732
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,471
What you doin'?

733
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,098
Is it over already?

734
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,182
Yup.

735
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,813
What did the diocese say?

736
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,108
Father Baek isn't here.

737
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,112
And there was a fire on top of that.

738
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,823
Nothing at all.

739
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,869
I guess they are leaving us on our own
since the end is near anyway.

740
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,164
So I'm thinking about what to do.

741
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,709
But you don't know a thing.

742
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,295
And there's nothing you can do.

743
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,510
Still, you looked badass for a second
when you told the investigator to leave.

744
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,428
-I did?
-You did!

745
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,356
Why did he disappear?

746
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,485
And when we're so helpless.

747
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,948
Remember what Father Baek used to say?

748
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,911
Maybe we're on our way to maturity.

749
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,331
That's even more confusing.

750
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,840
Father, would you like to eat first?

751
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,091
No, let's eat together.

752
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,176
-Okay.
-Thank you.

753
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,464
If I could,

754
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,593
I would spend the days we have left

755
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,888
finding those scumbags…

756
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,642
and punishing them.

757
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,020
I don't expect forgiveness.

758
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,777
With such ill thoughts…

759
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,657
I won't be able to reunite
with Min-ho, will I?

760
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,999
Sister Christina.

761
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,672
"Vengeance is mine."

762
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,508
"With vengeance, I will repay."

763
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,387
Those were God's words.

764
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,121
-I want sausage!
-Thank you for the grace you've given us.

765
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,706
I want sausage!

766
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,124
Amen.

767
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,875
I want sausage!

768
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,462
Goodness, the little pup must be hungry.

769
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,716
-Thank you for the food. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

770
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,801
-Drinks!
-Enjoy your meal.

771
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,387
You all worked hard today,
so let's share a drink.

772
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,513
Just one glass each.

773
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,474
Where's Mi-ryeong?

774
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,977
She said her stomach was upset.
She went home.

775
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,520
She told me to have dinner here.

776
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,689
What? Why doesn't she feel good?

777
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,441
Not sure. She said it was churning.

778
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,527
-But it's not good to skip meals.
-Eat up.

779
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,904
She's stressed out, that's why.

780
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,576
Father, about the Mass going forward…

781
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,460
It's me. Se-kyung.

782
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,648
Where did it all go?

783
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,233
Where…

784
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,194
We said we'd drink this together.

785
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,949
What?

786
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:55,036
I had only one thing on my mind
as I was coming home.

787
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,954
This!

788
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,331
I wanted a sip after taking a shower.

789
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,209
You're so mean.

790
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,633
What do I do now?

791
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,014
I put aside your jar.

792
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,731
So you did think about me.

793
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,994
Let's not think of anything else.

794
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,623
Together to the end.

795
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,122
It's raining hard.
