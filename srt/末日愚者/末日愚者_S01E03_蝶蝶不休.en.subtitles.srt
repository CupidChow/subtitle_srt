FLOATING BUNKER PRESENTATION

13
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,673
Sit down.

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,555
Why do you look so gaunt?
You must be hungry, right?

15
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,893
The soldiers gave me
some rice and soup earlier.

16
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,811
What?

17
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,523
They did a background check on me too.

18
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,652
They seemed so curious about me, you know.

19
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,161
You're tired. Wait here.
I'll get you something to eat.

20
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,996
-No, it's fine. Really--
-No.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,748
-Se-kyung.
-Let me get you something.

22
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,416
What should I do?

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,919
Just rest in the meantime, okay?

24
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,135
Let's drink something hot.
That would be nice.

25
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,679
There's so much I want to ask you.

26
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,475
Maybe I should let you sleep first.

27
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,563
Let's see.

28
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,482
Yes, I can use these.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,651
Yun-sang, are these…

30
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,563
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,733
What is it?

32
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,655
Oh no, you must be hot.

33
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,491
Let's get these clothes off you.
Come here. It's okay.

34
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,606
What happened to you?

35
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,959
198 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

36
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,474
BUILDING 121
23RD FLOOR

37
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,065
I made it without a break today.

38
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,167
As the coup led by military generals
has intensified into a civil war,

39
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,918
the damage has risen sharply.

40
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,670
299 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

41
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,756
A malfunction
in the capital's defense system

42
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,049
caused a missile launch,

43
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,261
destroying Korea's largest data center
in Woongcheon completely.

44
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,430
Various online services
have come to a stop,

45
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
and general communications are
in an unstable condition.

46
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,853
Doctor, please. Doctor!

47
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,357
Doctor, please take a look
at this patient.

48
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,359
Ji-eun. Can you hear me?

49
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,861
Wait here for a moment.
I'll go get a doctor!

50
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,154
Excuse me, this is my mom.

51
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,615
-Sorry, kid.
-Have you seen her? This is…

52
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,128
Doctor!

53
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,006
Have you seen my mom?

54
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,095
Their mother.

55
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,806
Mom?

56
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,774
As the government's measures
for the asteroid collision are delayed,

57
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,277
many protests are turning into riots.
Looting and arson have begun…

58
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,197
They are taking everything.
I bet they robbed our store.

59
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,116
-Darn it!
-Hey! Honey!

60
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,243
Breaking news.

61
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:54,664
As a peace rally urging for migration
took place at Woongcheon City Hall today,

62
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,084
unidentified rioters appeared
and indiscriminately targeted citizens…

63
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,794
Mom, things are weird here.

64
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,546
I'm scared.

65
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,091
I'm hiding with my friends,
so don't worry.

66
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,971
You're Wonder Woman,
and I'm Superman, right?

67
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,599
Mom, they're dragging my friends away.

68
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,936
Mom, those people aren't soldiers.

69
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,854
-Wait.
-Honey.

70
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,856
-What is it?
-Honey.

71
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,568
What is he talking about?

72
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,862
What is it?

73
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,781
What is he talking about? No!

74
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,286
Honey! Mi-ryeong!

75
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,330
198 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,248
Mi-ryeong!

77
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,249
Hey.

78
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,668
Well, I have a visitor at home,

79
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,337
and I don't have any food left.

80
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,880
Who's here?

81
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,051
Yun-sang?

82
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,471
Se-kyung!

83
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,476
That's such good news. This is so amazing!

84
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,230
We do have some food.

85
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,898
-Okay.
-I'll bring you some.

86
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,316
-Go and wait at home.
-Okay.

87
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,359
-Thanks.
-Sure.

88
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,693
Mi-ryeong, thank you!

89
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,822
That's so great!

90
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,704
Together to the end!

91
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,631
Yun-sang is back.

92
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,132
What?

93
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,551
Yun-sang came home.

94
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,221
-What?
-He's fast asleep, so don't wake him up!

95
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,057
Are you serious?

96
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,685
PALE BLUE DOT
COSMOS

97
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,729
I'm done reading.

98
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
You read all of that?

99
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,906
I think I now have a vague idea
of what my dad is thinking.

100
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,826
You mean eternal life?

101
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,620
Don't you resent your mom?

102
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,873
She left you and ran away,
just like my dad.

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,253
-Did you forgive her?
-This isn't about forgiving her.

104
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,673
Flowers only bloom in the spring,

105
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,175
but we don't get mad
and say that's unforgivable.

106
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,469
That's just how they are.

107
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,432
That's how I feel about Mom too.
Plus, she might have passed away.

108
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,184
Are you okay?

109
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,189
-With what?
-You could've lived.

110
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,194
Well, there are times
when I feel a surge of anger,

111
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,782
but I'm already used to this situation.
I've accepted that the asteroid is coming.

112
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,161
So you're philosophical about it?

113
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,580
I guess you transcended it or something.

114
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,168
-Hey, Yoo So-min.
-What?

115
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,794
-Hey, look here.
-Why?

116
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,129
-Your arm.
-What about it?

117
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,548
A blue butterfly!

118
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,917
Yun-sang.

119
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,713
Ha Yun-sang. Are you sleeping?

120
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,717
Is he still sleeping?

121
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,344
Hey. Ha Yun-sang.

122
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,637
What are you doing?

123
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,017
-Wait, please.
-Aren't you here to see Yun-sang?

124
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
Have you seen him?

125
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,773
No, but Se-kyung asked me
to bring over some food for him.

126
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,942
He's really back?

127
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,277
Yes, he is.

128
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,529
-Capt. Kang was telling the truth!
-Of course.

129
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,407
Sorry about that.

130
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,867
-Hi!
-Hello.

131
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,035
Good morning.

132
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,453
-Ms. Jin's home, right?
-What?

133
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,455
-Ms. Jin!
-Ms. Jin!

134
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,665
Ms. Jin has already gone to work.

135
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,209
Shall we head down together?

136
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
-I need to give these to Yun-sang--
-Yun…

137
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,838
-Yun-sang's back?
-Really?

138
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,673
-Really?
-That's crazy!

139
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,592
-Hello!
-Morning!

140
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,052
Hey!

141
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,563
It's an endless string of people.
How did they all sleep in there?

142
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,816
Hey, Jin-seo!

143
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,485
Your apartment is
as big as ours, isn't it?

144
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,528
It is.

145
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,658
Hey, you can't put that there.
That's the main entrance we all use!

146
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,831
Mr. Park.

147
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,999
Mr. Park.

148
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,920
See you, son.

149
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,421
Hey, Mr. Park!

150
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,048
Though the asteroid might…

151
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,259
Why would you put that
in front of the entrance?

152
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,845
Walk toward the center of the light…

153
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,763
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,432
Were they being loud at night?

155
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,269
If they were,
I would've reported them already.

156
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,729
I'm sorry. I'll move this right away.

157
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,817
It brims within my heart

158
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,240
Is it not possible there either?

159
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,909
Understood, sir.

160
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,916
Seoul stopped giving out snacks, too,
so we returned empty-handed.

161
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,793
This one's above my pay grade.

162
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,171
Captain, I think
you should go there yourself.

163
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,923
I should.

164
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:04,987
SNACKS

165
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,577
Kitty, is that you?

166
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,712
-Corporal Pang, what is it?
-What was that? What's going on?

167
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,297
-Where'd they come from?
-What's wrong?

168
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,217
-Over there!
-Do you see the chickens?

169
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,718
Fried chicken!

170
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,971
They're eating the peppers.
Protect the peppers!

171
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,473
-Hey!
-Hey, grab it!

172
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,476
Hey, catch it! Go on!

173
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,645
Why is that one so big?

174
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,980
Sergeant!

175
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
-Damn it.
-What do we do?

176
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,149
Do we chase them out of here?

177
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,442
Hey, get out of the way.

178
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,862
Since they're here,
let's just make baeksuk with them.

179
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,447
-Or fried chicken.
-Fried chicken?

180
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,199
They're touching our things!

181
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,081
-Okay.
-How do we catch them?

182
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,750
Guys.

183
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,668
Yes.

184
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,798
Let us serve them with courtesy.

185
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,133
-What?
-You mean the chickens?

186
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,300
They're honored guests!

187
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,346
-What?
-I didn't quite hear you.

188
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,432
Man, fuck this.

189
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,018
What's the arms inspection for
when we have no bullets?

190
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,479
-Please manage the firearms well.
-Yes, Captain.

191
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:05,983
Captain!

192
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,360
Captain!

193
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,195
Captain!

194
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
Yes, Mess Sergeant.

195
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,197
Ma'am.

196
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,785
Ma'am, I'm thinking about
making some chickens.

197
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,162
Are we having chicken today?

198
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,914
I think we are.
Half-fried and half-seasoned chicken?

199
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,750
Would you care to elaborate?

200
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,377
Yes, well, they're alive, and they go…

201
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,673
-Chicken.
-That's enough.

202
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,217
Why don't you give it a shot?

203
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,137
Really?

204
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,724
Okay, thank you. Ma'am!

205
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,850
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

206
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,727
-Ma'am.
-Yeah.

207
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
-These men are waiting to be discharged?
-Yes, that's right.

208
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,065
Sergeant.

209
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,567
-Sir.
-Hey.

210
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,569
I have something to tell you.

211
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,987
What is it?

212
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,323
Well, I'm thinking of making something.

213
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,703
Pang was saying something about plywood.
Do I have to guess what you're making?

214
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,788
Chickens.

215
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,000
-What about chickens?
-A flock of chickens came.

216
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,419
Yes, they came to us.

217
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,173
If we can build and provide
a cozy home for our guests to live in,

218
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,551
won't they show their gratitude
with some of their eggs?

219
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,223
Here's the crucial part.
We won't eat these eggs, Sergeant.

220
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,059
We'll take good care of them
and allow the babies to hatch.

221
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,727
Yes, I mean chicks.

222
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,064
Then we'll take good care of the chicks
and grow them into chickens.

223
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,401
Then we'll get twice, no, four times,
eight times as many eggs.

224
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,569
A lot of eggs.

225
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,363
Right.

226
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,449
Did you report this to Capt. Kang?

227
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,408
I did, sir.

228
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,661
Would three or four men be enough?

229
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,578
Yes, sir!

230
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,873
-Okay, I'll put in the word.
-Sir.

231
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,292
Thank you, sir.

232
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,259
She's gonna build a mansion
for some chickens.

233
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,266
198 DAYS LEFT
TOGETHER TO THE END

234
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,560
I ask that you all go back

235
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,148
and tell everyone
the central government is working hard

236
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,317
to get all citizens evacuated
to safe places.

237
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,361
That is all.

238
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,198
Mr. Prime Minister!

239
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,953
With all due respect,
what should we tell them?

240
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,331
The deputy mayor of Woongcheon.

241
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,876
Those with money and power
have all escaped.

242
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,546
Only the criminals are swarming around,
so what are you…

243
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,924
I don't know what to tell the people.

244
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,386
Who will you send to safety zones first?

245
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:44,016
You are supposed to tell us
how many will be sent on which days!

246
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,270
Families have lost their fortunes
to false promises of escaping the country.

247
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:54,109
Right now, children and adolescents
are falling victim to all sorts of crimes.

248
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:59,323
So if you keep repeating
these empty words,

249
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:03,160
exactly how do you expect to quell
the unrest of those who are left?

250
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,413
-Hello, it's really hot, isn't it?
-I'm well aware of that, but…

251
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,998
We'll check up on it.

252
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,791
Over here, please!

253
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,960
Even the president ran away!

254
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,214
Se-kyung, we're all going to die here,
aren't we?

255
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,509
How can the prime minister be
so irresponsible with no plans at all?

256
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,178
Our deputy mayor is so much better!

257
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,935
That is exactly why
all the brokers are running wild.

258
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,520
Kids are being kidnapped and imprisoned.

259
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,980
Politicians are terrible.

260
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,071
Nothing we can do about that.
It's not like we have options.

261
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,573
It would've been a little better
if we were in China.

262
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,909
Well, their country's huge, so…

263
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,411
But I hear
they'll be closing their borders.

264
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,413
Today, we got squid.

265
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,498
Hello.

266
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,836
What?

267
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,838
Just this one box?

268
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,175
I barely managed to get my hands on this.
They presell everything now.

269
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,843
Like I don't know that.

270
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,973
Think about the gas money.
We can't last until the next distribution.

271
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,976
Mister, where are you going?

272
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,524
Hey! Stop right there! Stop!

273
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,276
Where are you going? Get out!

274
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,360
Stop! Hey!

275
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,364
Hey!

276
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,203
My husband is dumb as a rock.

277
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,165
Did you hear about the floating bunker?

278
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,459
-Isn't that happening today?
-Yeah.

279
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,461
My mom's going there too.

280
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,422
My dad too.

281
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,966
Yes?

282
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,261
Mom, it's clearly a scam.
Do you really have to go?

283
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,809
Come on, the kids are curious about it.

284
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,812
Stop using the kids as an excuse!

285
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,316
Hey!

286
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,488
Who does this girl take after
with that short temper of hers, seriously?

287
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,994
I mean, Hae-chan,
your cousin keeps scolding me…

288
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,913
Never mind.

289
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,043
I'm not really mad, okay?
I wasn't yelling.

290
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:20,255
Hey, Woo-chan.
Let's go and watch the event now.

291
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,673
-Okay.
-Okay? Let's go.

292
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,969
So we're gonna sell stuff here
instead of heading downtown?

293
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,430
We won't sell much in this neighborhood.

294
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,100
Can't be helped, I guess.
It's too dangerous out there right now.

295
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,104
I bet Bae Jong-su's guys
are going berserk for revenge.

296
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,567
A gun would solve all our problems
at times like this.

297
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,990
Eternal life is not a religion.
It is science, everyone!

298
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,701
-Do not be fooled!
-It's not a religion!

299
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,454
Sure, we get it,
so get out of the way, okay?

300
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,122
Why are you blocking the way?

301
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,875
We are exercising our rights
in a calm and orderly manner!

302
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,128
You call this "calm and orderly"?

303
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,963
-Don't be fooled!
-It's not a religion.

304
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,132
I see their bullshit everywhere I go.

305
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,884
Eternal life, my ass!

306
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,512
Don't waste your money on this scam!

307
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,643
Hey, report these guys.
Throw them in jail!

308
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,979
It's the sea!

309
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,981
-What is it?
-It's the sea.

310
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,067
Can you see the sea?

311
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,985
-You see the sea?
-Okay.

312
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,114
Try it on!

313
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,077
Shall we go over to the other side?
Hold my hand.

314
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,997
Hey, hurry up and follow me.

315
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,417
Look over there! Goodness!

316
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,591
So we're really going to be safe
in those things?

317
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,177
Woo-chan.

318
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,681
As a representative of Toittech,
I'd like to greet all of you

319
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,851
who have joined us for the presentation
on our floating bunkers.

320
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,436
Thank you for coming!

321
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:05,193
You took time from your busy schedules,
so let me get started right away.

322
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,573
The first thing about these bunkers,
they float on the water!

323
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,705
They ride the waves!

324
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,373
Like clouds in the sky.

325
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,793
Even if the biggest tsunami hits,
it will only take two months

326
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,462
for the water level to go down.

327
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,213
Ultra-strong new material!

328
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,549
You'll certainly last two months
in these bunkers.

329
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,760
It's got a satellite connection
and a HVAC system.

330
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,220
You can even do some cooking.

331
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,764
Do you live alone? Then a bunker for one.

332
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,684
Are you married, dating,
siblings, best friends,

333
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,728
or having an affair? A bunker for two.

334
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,106
We can make bunkers for up to five people.

335
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,693
World-class pro surfers
have tried these out in the South Pacific

336
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,280
and confirmed
both their safety and performance!

337
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,498
Okay, I'll be honest with you today.
Let me lay everything out.

338
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,127
Why did we have a civil war?

339
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,546
Why did it happen?

340
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,091
I'll tell you why it occurred, okay?

341
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,302
This is why!

342
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:16,640
The powers-that-be took all the planes
and ships and ran off to save themselves!

343
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,060
And why don't we have enough supplies?

344
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,811
Why are we short on goods?

345
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:26,566
The rich are hogging everything
for themselves so only they can survive!

346
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,110
-That's right!
-Yeah, that's right.

347
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,322
Just look at this.

348
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,992
Cell service still hasn't been restored.
Look at what's happening.

349
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,078
You can drop it. It doesn't even work.

350
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,081
They don't care
as long as they don't have to suffer.

351
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,083
You see, the rich people

352
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:47,003
are using the Internet and phones
through satellite, okay?

353
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,756
You've heard of space bunkers
and underground cities, right?

354
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,425
I'm not talking about
some movie or TV show.

355
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,677
This is reality!

356
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,929
They have a world of their own.

357
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,266
And I'm saying
we should get a spot there too!

358
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,352
Yes!

359
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,317
Come on, just get to the point.

360
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,738
Every person for themselves.

361
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,412
Don't trust anyone, all right?

362
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,747
Don't be swayed.

363
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,001
Make your own coolheaded judgments.

364
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,423
I got distracted for a second.

365
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,678
Now, due to time constraints,
it will become difficult for Toittech

366
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,764
to produce these floating bunkers
at some point.

367
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,099
What does that mean?

368
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,436
It means that you need to hurry.

369
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,271
Hand out the order forms now.

370
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,482
They only accept dollars and gold.

371
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,028
That's a lot for a deposit,
don't you think?

372
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,655
Please fill it out and submit it.

373
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,657
The most important thing? Deposits first!

374
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,828
You have to make payment within two days
using the specified methods.

375
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,497
Starting now,
on a first-come, first-served basis,

376
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,541
I shall take 50 people!

377
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,253
Yes, that's right.

378
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,672
Excuse me, isn't this a bit too much?

379
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,842
You should give us some time
to compare and think about things.

380
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,843
It's a lot of money.

381
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,180
I won't force it upon you.

382
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,514
I'll put my order in!

383
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,311
Everyone, do not be deceived!

384
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,521
Stop fooling these people!

385
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,941
The asteroid collision
is the beginning of eternal life!

386
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,244
Block the entrance!

387
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,163
Let's go!

388
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,417
Mr. Jeong, this isn't a scam, is it?

389
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,253
I don't like how they're demanding
the deposit right away.

390
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,131
Hey, think it over first.

391
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,550
It's not like
we have to pay the deposit today.

392
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,430
The asteroid collision
is the beginning of eternal life.

393
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,850
Everyone, do not waste your money
on these bunkers.

394
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,062
Humanity will not cease to exist anyway!

395
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,730
I'm not tricking anyone!

396
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,607
You morons and your cult!

397
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,984
-What, punk?
-Don't be fooled by them!

398
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,362
Su-geun!

399
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,116
Get rid of them!

400
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,785
Everyone, do not be deceived.

401
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,453
Do not doubt.

402
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,455
Our future selves are waiting for us.

403
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,458
Everyone, do not doubt!

404
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,961
A new, inextinguishable sun is burning.

405
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,214
Everyone, do not be deceived.
Do not doubt!

406
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,841
A new sun burns!

407
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,467
Everyone, do not doubt--

408
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,179
Everyone! Eternal life!

409
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,316
Zero-five-two…

410
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,521
Ha Yun-sang!

411
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,106
You're up?

412
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,983
Sung-jae!

413
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,611
How did you get here?

414
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,905
How were things in the US?

415
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,907
I heard they declared martial law too.

416
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,825
Yun-sang.

417
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,371
I heard they're making bunkers
and shelters everywhere.

418
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,791
Is it really safe on the East Coast?

419
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,423
Hey, you still have this picture?

420
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,469
There are so many of them.

421
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,474
Want a hand?

422
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,060
How could you go silent on me for months?

423
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,979
We were worried
something might have happened to you.

424
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,773
-You should've reached out.
-Sung-jae!

425
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,652
What is this?

426
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,240
It's raining.

427
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,703
How refreshing.

428
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,752
The world is just full
of such stupid, despicable people.

429
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,051
You be careful too.
Your friend's dad seemed like the leader.

430
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,721
You used to chase him around,
calling him a great investment analyst.

431
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,014
That's absurd!

432
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,519
Anyway, don't hang around
with that kid of his!

433
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,606
Bullshit, you and him are the same.
What makes you any different?

434
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,070
Yes, good.

435
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,572
-These are all yours.
-Mom.

436
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,867
-Just give them to me, not those scammers.
-Bracelet…

437
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,827
Can't you tell that it's a scam?

438
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,208
No, because I'm ignorant and uneducated.

439
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,878
I'm desperate to find a way

440
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,214
to save you and the little ones,
so I'm bending over backwards--

441
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,799
"Bending over backwards"?

442
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,260
No one says that even where you're from.

443
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,219
What, you brat?

444
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,346
I mean, you even took the kids
to that mess.

445
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:37,437
Fine! It must be nice to be so smart,
unlike your ignorant, uneducated mother!

446
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:42,108
-Hae-chan, where is Mom's picture?
-You and I need to talk.

447
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,036
Damn it!

448
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,060
Yun-sang! Ha Yun-sang!

449
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,980
Se-kyung, go to Father Baek! Go to--

450
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,855
Just leave your bike here.
Let's go get a drink!

451
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,857
-Yeah, let's celebrate D-200.
-No, I--

452
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,358
Sorry, I'll see you tomorrow.

453
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,194
Forget it.
She's probably going somewhere nice.

454
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,863
Stop bugging her. Let's go!

455
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,198
Se-kyung,
you don't want to miss out on this.

456
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,284
-Goodbye.
-Good job today. Drive safely.

457
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,702
Yeah, take care.

458
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,953
Bye!

459
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,872
-Se-kyung!
-Yes?

460
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,457
You're gonna regret this!

461
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,624
Have fun!

462
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,466
Where did my bike go?

463
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,959
JUST YOU WAIT
I'LL MAKE THINGS FUN FOR YOU

464
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,688
Sorry I'm late.

465
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,857
I did a little cleaning for you.

466
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,359
Why are you trying so hard already?

467
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,780
After a good sleep, I felt energized.

468
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,492
I had the best sleep ever!

469
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,788
But most of all…

470
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,251
seeing you makes me feel at ease.

471
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,884
Okay, but wait.
Let me get changed first, okay?

472
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,553
-Make it quick, okay?
-Okay!

473
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,666
-You didn't change?
-What? Oh, I can't be bothered.

474
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,295
What is this? Can I open it?

475
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,172
Of course you can.

476
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,633
It's whole-bean coffee.

477
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,426
Wait a second.

478
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,262
The smell will knock you out!

479
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,436
I can't believe this is happening.

480
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,190
Seriously, this is so good.

481
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,696
I want to drink some now.
I can't wait until tomorrow.

482
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,197
Thank you.

483
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:05,950
What?

484
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,551
Can I stay the night?

485
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,805
Of course.

486
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,829
-Se-kyung.
-Yeah?

487
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,874
When I was doing the laundry,

488
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,834
I saw the disinfectant.

489
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,592
And that big bottle was almost empty.

490
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,803
Oh, I just accidentally spilled some,

491
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:12,016
and after the riots,
there were garbage and bodies everywhere,

492
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,351
so I had to use it a lot.

493
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,645
What's that thing doing here?

494
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,856
Se-kyung.

495
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,774
Yeah?

496
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,113
You don't have to tell me now.

497
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,243
You can tell me when you feel comfortable.

498
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,873
Let's take this slow.

499
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,500
Okay?

500
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,794
Okay.

501
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,884
My turn.

502
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,774
You're all out early.

503
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,567
Morning.

504
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,569
Is that a chicken crowing?

505
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,905
-Hello.
-Yes, hello!

506
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,574
Excuse me.

507
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,493
Did you all hear?

508
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,954
Do you have any news to share?

509
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,915
Why are you all so slow with information?

510
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,000
Well, someone came back.

511
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,841
Come on, who on earth
would come back here?

512
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,010
-Goodness!
-That's not what's important.

513
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,472
Someone came back to this country.
What do you think that means?

514
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,058
It means the person's crazy, that's what!

515
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,727
Why would anyone come back to this place?

516
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,772
No way! Does that mean
it's still possible to leave?

517
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,190
It must be true.

518
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,900
Selective migration.

519
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,489
Who told you that?

520
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,907
Someone came back?

521
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,410
How do you get chosen
for selective migration?

522
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,661
It's Yun-sang.

523
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,998
My goodness.

524
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,543
Are you ignoring me?
Your little cousins will get hurt.

525
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,380
Okay.

526
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,465
Here we go.

527
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,383
One.

528
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,969
Two. Start.

529
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,471
Two.

530
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:14,889
Three.

531
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,975
Okay, let's try again.

532
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,143
Start.

533
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,644
One.

534
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,647
Again. Go.

535
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,442
I smell something good.

536
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,278
Hey, Seo Woo-chan! Where are you going?

537
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,909
Yes, Woo-chan, come on in.

538
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,411
Let's wash your hands now.

539
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,830
There, good boy.

540
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,917
-All done?
-Yes.

541
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,001
Dry them.

542
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,211
Wait, wipe your hands.

543
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,173
Wash your hands.

544
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,926
Okay, fine.

545
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,179
What about So-min?

546
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,389
She didn't come up?

547
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,935
She didn't.

548
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,273
Inconveniences will continue as the repair
of the communication systems destroyed

549
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,442
in the asteroid crisis
is experiencing delays.

550
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,027
Woongcheon City, as usual,

551
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,948
is doing its utmost to prepare a plan
for citizens' migration to safe zones…

552
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,951
Excuse me, where's Ms. Jin?

553
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,702
She was here a minute ago.

554
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,961
Ms. Jin!

555
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,817
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

556
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,238
Didn't I tell you
not to leave the neighborhood?

557
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,573
Go home now.

558
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,199
I have something to tell you.

559
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,909
What is it?

560
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,661
Ms. Jin.

561
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,585
I don't think Bae Jong-su was it.
There are a few others under him as well.

562
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,921
I know.
There are a lot of people involved.

563
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,673
It's not just us.

564
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,844
I think they might do something
to kids like Woo-chan and Hae-chan.

565
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,012
What?

566
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,395
SHOULD I LET THE MANAGERS KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE?

567
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,440
You should be careful too.

568
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,819
I'm more worried now Bae Jong-su's dead
than I was when the jerk was alive.

569
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,448
You came here to tell me…

570
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,043
When are they coming?

571
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,544
They should be here any minute.

572
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,962
Be careful with the oil.

573
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,547
We need the beer here too.

574
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,467
Okay, the beer has arrived!

575
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,469
How did you manage to get it?

576
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,721
-I was lucky.
-Thank you.

577
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,641
Hey, Ha Yun-sang!

578
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,226
It's good to see you, In-a!

579
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,733
-Yun-sang!
-Mi-ryeong!

580
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,237
How are you doing?

581
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,864
I have butterflies.

582
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,577
Forget it. Let's sit down.

583
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,496
-Come sit.
-Mi-ryeong.

584
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,457
-What's with all the food?
-There's more inside.

585
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,003
That day when they stormed
into the office, I was like,

586
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,340
"I have this important key in my hand…"

587
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,720
which was a total bluff!

588
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:43,931
Come on.

589
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,266
Seriously.

590
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,771
How would a subcontractor like me
have something so important?

591
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,690
You've got some nerve.

592
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,442
Anyhow, I managed to persuade them

593
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,029
and found myself a ride
on a military plane.

594
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,700
Then I ended up in Japan.

595
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,537
I didn't know what to do there.

596
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,374
I was completely abandoned at the airport.

597
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,085
"So I'm a refugee now."

598
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,548
"This isn't someone else's story now."

599
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,135
That was what I thought.

600
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,680
But it's good that you came back.

601
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,849
It was a grand odyssey.

602
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,561
You really went through a lot.

603
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,068
Come on, no need for applause!

604
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,070
-You deserve it.
-There you go!

605
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,906
I want to see it happen.

606
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,408
-What?
-What?

607
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,618
Your nuptial mass.

608
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,372
I want to see your wedding no matter what.

609
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,000
How about it?

610
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,004
Yes, let's do it!

611
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,338
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

612
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,596
It's acting up again.

613
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,348
Come on, lights!
You chose the wrong time to go out!

614
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,225
Let's turn this on.

615
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,605
No, don't worry.
We have a lot of candles, don't we?

616
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,776
Excuse me,
your uninvited guest has arrived.

617
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,943
Come on in.

618
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,445
Uninvited guest? No way.

619
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,408
This looks good.

620
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,701
-Father.
-Yes?

621
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,995
I raided the church fridge. Is that okay?

622
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,498
Of course. No problem at all.

623
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,546
If Father Baek were here,
he'd be deeply moved by this sight.

624
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,133
Father…

625
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,684
Right, so when is the nuptial mass
going to take place?

626
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,144
Let's just do it.

627
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,396
Father Woo, you can officiate.

628
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,649
Who? Me?
Officiate Se-kyung and Yun-sang's--

629
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,025
I'm totally opposed to that.

630
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,904
You have no options. He'll have to do it.

631
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,741
Well, his hard no
makes me want to do it even more.

632
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,660
-You have to.
-Then shall I have a go?

633
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,162
Something came up
with the night shift team.

634
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,414
I'll be right back. Just have fun.

635
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,333
I would gladly…

636
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,918
-Your debut!
-I'll give it a shot.

637
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:18,919
Really?

638
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,547
-Shall I give it a try, then?
-Sure.

639
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,881
Let's do this.

640
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,966
I'll go talk to her.

641
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,344
Can I get the car keys?

642
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,345
The car keys?

643
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,764
Where are you going?

644
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,184
Something came up
with the night shift team. I'll be back.

645
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,478
Don't go too far. It's almost out of gas.

646
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,481
Cheers.

647
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,817
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

648
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,029
She said she'd be right back.
She's off to city hall.

649
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,740
-I hope I look the part.
-You do, I mean it.

650
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,951
We have no choice.

651
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,620
Father Baek isn't here,
so Father Woo has to do it.

652
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,738
Get out.

653
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,781
Hurry up!

654
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,920
I said I'd give it to you!

655
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,672
How dare you!

656
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,103
So-min.

657
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,773
So-min.
