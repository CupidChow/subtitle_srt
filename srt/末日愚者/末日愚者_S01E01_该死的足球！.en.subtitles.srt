00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,315
Mom, are you back?

7
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,989
She's not here. Not even today.

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,161
We're all doomed!

9
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,185
-Kids!
-Hae-chan, it's okay.

10
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,188
We don't have to worry about
asteroid collisions anymore.

11
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,110
Scientists have discovered many ways
to change the asteroids' orbits.

12
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,948
One way is to create
a direct collision with the asteroids.

13
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,285
This asteroid is called Didymos,

14
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,121
and a small moon circles around it.

15
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,373
You've heard of Didymoon, right?

16
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,083
Yes!

17
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,210
Then do you know what this is?

18
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,129
A space probe!

19
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,423
I don't know!

20
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,593
How do you not know that?
It's a space probe!

21
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,844
Good for you!

22
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,889
Three years ago, in 2022,

23
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,392
this space probe flew into space,
traveled for ten months,

24
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,935
and crashed into Didymoon.

25
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,480
Just like this,
you can change an asteroid's orbit.

26
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:14,235
Even just a tiny shift in the orbit
can prevent it from colliding with Earth.

27
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,074
Hae-chan, isn't that great?

28
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeah! Awesome!

29
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,501
The asteroid is coming!

30
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,047
It will kill us all!

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,887
Wonderful!

32
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,391
Great! We're all fucking doing it!

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,728
Awesome!

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,942
"My brother is blowing up a big balloon."

35
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,528
"Stop. I can't watch.
It looks like it's gonna pop."

36
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,908
"I have butterflies."

37
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,326
Great!

38
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,168
Everybody's going to die!
How fucking fair!

Some believed. Others didn't.

You and I lived for the honor

66
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,290
Of protecting our country

67
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,509
Se-kyung, you broke your record
by 3 minutes and 30 seconds!

68
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,641
Your body is itching, huh? I bet it is!

69
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,727
Easy does it!
You don't wanna tear a muscle!

70
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,523
She can't play in a match
or coach the kids.

71
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,525
I bet she has ants in her pants.

72
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:42,295
VACANT

73
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,578
I'll be back. Mind the house, Ha Yun-sang.

74
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,423
This is Sejong International Airport.

75
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,927
Flights heading to countries

76
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,428

77
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,432
We kindly advise that you wait
for further departure announcements.

79
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,815
Let's get going!

80
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,776
-Excuse me.
-Yes!

81
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,694
-My son's family is leaving today.
-Yes.

82
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm just asking because I'm so worried.

83
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,616
I heard they will be forced
to build bunkers for the rich

84
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,701
and then abandoned once they're done.

85
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,453
That's never going to happen.

86
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,205
It's all fake news.

87
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,960
We are instructed
according to the international treaties,

88
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,670
so you don't need to worry.

89
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,755
-Are you going to Nigeria?
-No, my son is.

90
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,924
Then step aside.
You can't be in this line.

91
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,093
Look for the kids.

92
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,804
Jae-won!

93
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,556
There they are.

94
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,225
Jae-won! We're over here!

95
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,393
South Korea!

96
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,104
South Korea!

97
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,021
Mom!

98
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,607
-Mom!
-My goodness!

99
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,944
-Dad, you didn't have to come!
-How did you get here?

100
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,195
We finally found you.

101
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,493
They said we couldn't take these on board.

102
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,079
How will you live
without doenjang and gochujang?

103
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,665
-But you need these.
-I know. I'm sorry.

104
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,834
Hang on. Eat these on the way.

105
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,003
No, we're fine. Food is scarcer here.

106
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,422
We got a whole bunch here.
These are hard to get.

107
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,008
-They sure are.
-That's why you should have them.

108
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,676
Here. Take these.

109
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,680
The situation has changed
due to the unprecedented natural disaster.

110
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,098
Now we are refugees.

111
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,518
The talk about being abandoned
after the bunkers are done,

112
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,353
that's a false rumor.

113
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,149
It's all fake news. So don't worry.

114
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,651
Let's see them off with a smile.

115
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,403
Yes, we should.

116
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,405
-I'll come back for you two.
-Okay.

117
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,990
We'll come to get you.

118
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,491
Don't worry about us!

119
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,663
We're happy as long as you're safe there.
Don't you worry.

120
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,790
Ha-yul.

121
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,128
Don't rely on your mom and dad.
Make friends as soon as you get there.

122
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,050
Jin-seo, don't cry.

123
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,928
You'll be amazing wherever you are.

124
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,515
It's good
that people have calmed down now.

125
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,312
I'm glad you're leaving
when people are waiting in line like this.

126
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,189
They all seem nice now.

127
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,567
Totally. It was literally hell before.

128
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,194
They really have calmed down now.

129
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,489
Let's make this a nice farewell.

130
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,200
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

131
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,369
Will I survive if I leave here?

132
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,371
Am I going to live for sure?

133
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,209
Sure.

134
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,252
Ha-yul, hurry up. Let's go now.

135
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,923
-Come on. Let's go.
-Bye.

136
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,592
Hurry up now.

137
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,056
-Ms. Jin!
-Ha-yul!

138
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,057
So-min.

139
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,144
-Ms. Jin.
-What?

140
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,980
A love letter?

141
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,483
Read it when you're alone.

142
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,944
Okay.

143
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,405
Ha-yul. We really need to go. Come on.

144
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,616
You should go. Stay safe.

145
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,328
Hurry up, would you?

146
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
Come here.

147
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,544
It's okay.

148
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,466
We're okay.

149
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,807
Inconveniences will continue
as the repair of communication systems

150
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,309
destroyed in the asteroid crisis
is being delayed.

151
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,730

the suspension of public transportation,

free shuttles to Seoul, four times a day.

153
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,198
Emergency supplies will resume today
following sourcing difficulties.

154
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,576
Sir, this way.

155
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,578
-Slowly.
-You can take my hand.

156
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,665
-Hi, Ms. Jin.
-Ms. Jin!

157
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,418
How long do I have to wait?
We've been here for hours.

158
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,836
-Hi.
-Good morning.

159
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,590
-Distributing ration tickets now.
-Good morning, everyone.

160
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,593
Ms. Jin, are you going to help
at the hospital today?

161
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,510
Yes.

162
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,181
My counseling sessions
with the bereaved start at ten.

163
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
I'll have a break at two
and be at the hospital by four.

164
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,102
Noted. Have a good one, then.

You must be looking forward to that day.

168

As NASA announced,

174
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,723
the Korean Peninsula, unfortunately,
will be the impact location.

175
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,310
Therefore, the government
will set out a migration plan.

176
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,064
Until then,
to protect the lives of the citizens,

177
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,902
as of 00:00 on April 29, 2025,

178
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,198
martial law will be declared nationwide.

179
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,414
300 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

180
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,252
CITIZENS RIOT AT NEWS OF MARTIAL LAW

181
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,420
ARE THEY ABANDONING
THE COUNTRY AMID CRISIS?

182
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,922
CHAOS AND FEAR AROUND THE WORLD

183
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,178
Why are you hiding?

184
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,975
Apparently, there are armed people
in the building.

185
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,353
Are you okay?

186
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,381
It's got nothing to do with me.

187
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,718
They're here to hold
the higher-ups to ransom.

188
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,638
They don't care about a lab gofer like me.

189
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
Okay, thank God.

190
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,892
TIME FOR THE WORLD TO UNITE

191
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm more worried about these guys.

192
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,647
I can't get proper sample reactions
when they are scared.

193
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:00,983
I see.

194
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,029
I heard soldiers are fighting
each other there.

195
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,325
There's a rebellion and even a riot.

196
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,910
Is Father Baek doing okay?

197
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,329
I'll be there as soon as I can.

198
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,666
I'm on wait lists for flights already
so I can get on the earliest one.

199
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,919
You're coming here? Are you insane?

200
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,795
This place is a war zone!

201
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,590
All the more reason
I need to be there, silly!

202
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,011
I'm glad I picked up
our rings in advance.

203
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,596
REFUGEE RESOLUTION UNDER CONSIDERATION

204
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,474
This one is yours,
and this one is mine.

205
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,602
I'm wearing them both
so I don't lose them!

206
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,355
You and your random optimism.

207
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,024
SEA OF FIRE TO STRIKE
THE KOREAN PENINSULA IN 300 DAYS

208
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,695
Stay put until it gets quiet here, okay?

209
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,949
You said that your lab
is protected by the US government.

210
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,700
It'll be safer there--

211
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,120
What was that?

212
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,581
They're so close.

213
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,385
Did you lock the door?

214
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,136
Yeah, I did.

215
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,930
IS SOUTH KOREA ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR?

216
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,808
I shouldn't make any noise, right?
Should I just hang up?

217
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,393
Just wait. It's--

218
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,355
COLLISION WILL CAUSE A HUGE TSUNAMI

219
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,986
It's quite noisy outside,
so they can't hear us.

220
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,240
GLOBAL APOCALYPSE IN 300 DAYS

221
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,742
KOREAN PENINSULA TO BE ENGULFED IN FLAMES

222
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,206
MIGRATION PLANS IN PREPARATION
CITIZENS' SAFETY COMES FIRST

223
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,010
Get out! Open this fucking door!

224
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,763
Yun-sang.

225
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,515
Yun-sang! Answer me. Ha Yun--

226
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,934
Se-kyung, go to Father Baek!

227
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,652
I'm aware it was against the ban
on rallies, but this is too much!

228
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,323
The congregants came to pray,
one by one, purely out of anxiety.

229
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,657
It's not like

230
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,494
the father is deceiving people
and spreading rumors.

231
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,830
He has devoted himself
to the development of this community…

232
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,833
Brothers and sisters.

233
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,379
Let us not worry and pray instead.

234
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,590
We will meet again soon.

235
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,636
Though it may take some time,

236
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:20,808
we must believe in the power of prayer
and pray for one another.

237
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,938
These soldiers here
are merely performing their duties.

238
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,025
So, please, pray for them too.

239
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,985
Please get in the car.

240
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,695
Father.

241
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,281
Move!

242
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,866
-Father Baek.
-Father!

243
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,120
-Father!
-Father!

244
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,372
-Father.
-Father!

245
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,043
Father Baek, it's about Yun-sang.
I can't reach Yun-sang.

246
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,548
All of you will be arrested immediately
if you hold a rally again. Got that?

247
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,716
Father Baek!

248
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,555
-Father Baek!
-Father!

249
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,306
I was a fool just now.

250
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,977
-I should've just stopped them.
-You really should have!

251
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,728
You should have, Father!

252
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,148
Whether they are cops or soldiers,

253
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,067
they can't just barge
through the fences like that.

254
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,485
That's right!

255
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,322
We should've laid down on the road
and blocked the path.

256
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,158
To see if they could drive over us!

257
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,410
I've always wanted to try that, you know!

258
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,662
He will be back soon.

259
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,582
You all know what Father Baek is like.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,670
He's probably prepared
all kinds of safety nets.

261
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,506
I take it you know something we don't?

262
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,384
Actually, you know what?
Let's go pray, everyone.

263
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,764
Wait. Everyone!

264
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,018
For now, you should just go home.

265
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:46,935
But why?

266
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,938
We can't gather for the time being.

267
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,566
Just for a while--

268
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,067
Ms. Jin! Se-kyung!

269
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,864
After the military leaders tried to take
strategic weapons and seek asylum,

270
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,033
a military rebellion led to a civil war.

271
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:05,078
Loud gunfire and smoke have been reported
in the capital area ever since.

272
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,831
WEDDING
HA YUN-SANG, JIN SE-KYUNG

273
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,874
Prepare migration plans!

274
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,791
Is Yun-sang…

275
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,128
not coming?

276
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,050
From young students to the elderly,

277
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,221
those gathered in the square
are desperately crying out for survival.

278
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,305
POSTPONED

279
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,473
Next news.

280
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,809
A mass jailbreak occurred
at Woongcheon Prison.

281
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,397
Among the convicts are violent criminals
who committed murder and kidnapping.

282
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,068
The authorities have stressed the need
for caution in this dangerous situation.

283
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,071
MASS JAILBREAK AT WOONGCHEON PRISON

284
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,211
An asteroid is coming!

285
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,337
PEACE RALLY
MAY 10, 2025

286
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,007
Everybody, please do not be fooled
by false rumors!

287
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,008
We want to live!

288
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,220
Selective migration is not true!

289
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,263
PREPARE MIGRATION PLANS

290
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,639
SAVE THE CHILDREN AT LEAST

291
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,684
This is Kim Min-ho
from Cheondong Middle School.

292
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,853
I'm currently out here
at the Woongcheon citizens' peace rally.

293
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,189
Do you think it's true
that an asteroid is coming?

294
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,443
I urge you and beg you out of desperation.

295
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,113
Please do not be fooled by false rumors!

296
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,197
Don't be fooled!

297
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,951
Selective migration is not true!

298
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,538
As a citizen of Woongcheon,
what do you think, Ms. Jeong Ha-yul?

299
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
-Yoo So-min.
-Hi!

300
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,457
Park Jin-seo.

301
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:37,212
The government plans to send
as many of us as possible to a safe place!

302
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,463
You're lying!

303
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,466
It's Ms. Jin!

304
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,467
Ms. Jin!

305
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,719
Ms. Jin!

306
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,387
Ms. Jin! We're here!

307
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:52,853
WOONGCHEON CITY HALL
WOONGCHEON CITY HOSPITAL

308
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,909
Cheondong Middle School, Class 2-2!

309
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,661
Cheondong Middle--

310
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,289
Let's get the children to safety first!

311
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,333
Class 2-2!

312
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,293
Help! Please help us!

313
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,218
Ms. Jin!

314
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,303
Ha-yul.

315
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,765
Ms. Jin!

316
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,436
MY DEAR CLASS 2-2

317
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,854
Su-yeon, where are you?

318
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,607
I'm hiding alone in a bathroom.

319
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,025
Ms. Jin, I'm so scared!

320
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,526
I'm with Jin-seo.

321
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,153
-They took Ji-u and Su-yeon.
-Guys.

322
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,364
Come to the right back corner.
We can hide here.

323
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,532
They're taking our friends!

324
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,484
Ms. Jin!

325
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,205
Ms. Jin!

326
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,758
As the leadership
of the rebel forces surrendered,

327
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,887
the post-crisis civil war
has now passed a critical point.

328
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,388
279 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

329
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,931
Check if there are more survivors.

330
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,350
Hey, block off this side too!

331
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,233
Hyeon-ju!

332
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,658
Hyeon-ju!

333
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,576
Ms. Jin.

334
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,161
Ms. Jin.

335
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,913
Ms. Jin!

336
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,830
Excuse…

337
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,165
Hyeon-ju!

338
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,088
Oh no!

339
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,093
Ha-yul.

340
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,598
Ha-yul.

341
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,523
MS. JIN

342
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,030
Ha-yul!

343
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,121
No, they're not here.

344
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,874
Not here.

345
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,044
Min-ho's shoes can't be here.

346
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,049
They can't be here. They can't be.

347
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,052
No, not these. They're not here.

348
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,637
-No.
-Ma'am.

349
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,723
Ma'am.

350
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,434
This shoe is

351
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,478
Min-ho's.

352
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,737
My son!

353
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,825
Ma'am?

354
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,743
Ma'am.

355
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,830
Ma'am!

356
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,833
Ma'am!

357
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,918
The majority of the identified victims

358
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,170
are Cheondong Middle School students

359
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,840
who went missing
during the asteroid crisis.

360
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,011
The kidnappers were the prisoners
who escaped from Woongcheon Prison.

361
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,929
We suspect they kidnapped the children

362
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,683
and confined them in a container
with the intention of human trafficking.

363
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,685
The Woongcheon City Government

364
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,522
will stand with the victims' families
in these times of pain and sorrow,

365
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,693
and we promise that we will do
our utmost to remedy the situation.

366
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,531
We will do our best to make sure
that this tragedy will never be repeated.

367
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:26,061
201 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

368
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,329
Mr. Jeong Su-geun.

369
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,414
US-bound, right?

370
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,584
Good. All done.

371
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,336
There you go.

372
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,464
-Next, please!
-Come on.

373
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,258
Hurry up, please!

374
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,094
TRAVEL DENIED

375
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,680
Mr. Jeong. One moment, please.

376
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,931
-Sorry?
-Just a moment.

377
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,848
Dad.

378
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,101
Yes.

379
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,353
He's been rejected by the embassy.

380
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,230
Is there a problem?

381
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,359
What's going on?

382
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,362
Hey, I'm not like the others.
I'm an immigrant investor!

383
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,656
It was arranged by a certified company.

384
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,659
I even made a donation
to a state-operated youth center.

385
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,160
Please take him away.

386
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,245
This way.

387
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,371
What on earth…

388
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,123
I mean, check it again!

389
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,583
You can talk to them. Please get moving.

390
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,545
No, wait.

391
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,880
Next, please.

392
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,593
Wait your turn, please!

393
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,681
I mean, you should at least tell me
what it is you're checking.

394
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,520
You're just telling us to wait here
without our passports and phones.

395
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,856
I'm feeling very anxious here.

396
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,290
Something must have gone wrong.

397
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,252
Whatever it is, I wouldn't be surprised.

398
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,712
Stop being mean, would you?

399
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,214
Don't you want to live
without Dad for once?

400
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,718
Hey, isn't that guy Jeong Su-geun?

401
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,636
-Where? Oh, yeah.
-He is Jeong Su-geun.

402
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,804
That's him.

403
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,185
Don't give up on life so soon.

404
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,688
Those who deserve to die
are having the time of their lives.

405
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,106
Dear Woongcheon citizens…

406
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,358
I told you we don't sell bread.

407
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,360
When you need help…

408
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,198
Butterfish?

409
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,908
Yeah, ten of them. They look all right.

410
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,825
10 MACKERELS

411
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,535
We're charging two ration tickets for one.

412
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,453
BUTTERFISH

413
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,454
That's expensive.

414
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,206
How many did you say?

415
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,791
I said ten.

416
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,628
Seasonal fish are becoming scarce too.

417
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,712
They sure are.

418
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,215
Is Ji-eun not here yet?

419
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,801
No. She went to meet that guy.

420
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,385
So they're still together. Hi!

421
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,553
MOIRA
SUPERMAN AND WONDERMART

422
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,013
Together to the end!

423
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,015
Okay. See you later at Moira!

424
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,308
Together to the end.

425
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,728
Father!

426
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,439
You ran out of food again?

427
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,857
Tell me what you need.

428
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,823
Well, I was going to take her
with me the other day.

429
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:29,577
But a tiny wildcat sneaked into the garden
and ruined the lettuce, so…

430
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,998
Keep lying like that,
and you'll go to hell alone in 200 days.

431
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,503
You know,

432
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,007
you don't have to use the back door
when visiting the Lord's house.

433
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,095
Come through the front door anytime.

434
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,973
Whether it's day or night,

435
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,434
a door will open
as long as you turn its knob.

436
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,687
Bark now. Woof!

437
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,647
-Bark!
-Woof!

438
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,357
Bowwow!

439
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,069
I'll be off. See ya!

440
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,827
Take care, Father.

441
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,871
See you.

442
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,956
I'll make sure to bring her next time.

443
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,465
I'm sorry I asked for too much.

444
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,387
The manager of this center
insisted on donating to your unit,

445
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,139
so don't feel bad.

446
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,057
Thank you.

447
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,564
I heard that immigrants are only welcomed
when they bring a bunch of Korean goods.

448
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:45,612
Medical supplies, cosmetics, snacks,
instant noodles, and even candy and gum.

449
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,863
IM LOGISTICS CENTER

450
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,617
The government is sending all this stuff,
leaving none behind for the people here.

451
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,412
Production lines and logistics
are running fine for now, but…

452
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,331
-Mr. Moon.
-Yes?

453
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,166
-Those go on the military truck.
-Okay.

454
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,381
-Can I really have a bite?
-Sure, you can.

455
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,092
How is it?

456
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,511
It's really good!

457
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,015
It's tough to feed them
three times a day, isn't it?

458
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,809
It sure is.

459
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,146
The supply depot says
they have to give out combat rations now.

460
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,358
You should start taking
discharge applications.

461
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,110
They won't starve to death out here.

462
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,279
The ration system is expanding.

463
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,283
More than half of the discharged soldiers
end up in gangs.

464
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,788
That kind would make trouble
wherever they are.

465
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,873
Some things are out of our hands.

466
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,585
There isn't much time left anyway,
so let's not try too hard.

467
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,922
Working as factory security
is quite all right for me, you know.

468
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,470
I'm sorry that you got discharged
because of me.

469
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,222
I'm okay. I mean it.

470
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,850
This factory will close down
once the stockpile is gone.

471
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,771
It's about time
I start bumming around living on rations.

472
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,151
Commander Choi! Give me a hand here!

473
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:08,861
Coming!

474
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,282
I'll see you when I see you.

475
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,251
I'm coming!

476
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,920
WELCOME TO WOONGCHEON
CITY OF THE FUTURE

477
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,507
Any plans for discharge?

478
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,343
I have nowhere else to be.

479
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,763
Starting next week,
you can apply regardless of rank.

480
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,687
Bring them over.

481
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,564
Four pieces per person.

482
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,194
Look at them lining up for Spam.

483
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,114
Guys! We're having Spam today!

484
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,537
Make sure they all get fed,
or we'll get shot.

485
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:04,500
We need to make sure they eat their fill
at every meal, no matter what it is.

486
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,586
I mean, greens are good,

487
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:11,090
but when they lack animal protein,
they get a little cranky, to be honest.

488
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,176
Kim Hyeon-sik, you brat.

489
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,343
You got four. Go.

490
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,095
So much for eating my fill.

491
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,765
ETERNAL LIFE
ETERNALLY FREE

492
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,184
Though the asteroid might end the world…

493
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,186
ETERNAL LIFE IS NOT A RELIGION
IT'S SCIENCE

494
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,354
Walk toward the center of the light

495
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,941
You will find no death or extinction

496
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,278
The theory of promise is forever true

497
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,573
-Two ration tickets for a charger.
-It's a drama.

498
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,076
-What's this one?
-Reality show. One ration ticket.

499
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,745
I'll take these. Three tickets.

500
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,662
-Thanks.
-Bye.

501
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,247
You Quiz on the Block is in this.

502
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,665
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

503
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,584
-You better not be lying.
-Of course not.

504
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,673
-Hey, we got ten dollars!
-Ten dollars?

505
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,512
It's Ms. Jin.

506
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,515
You're all home, right?
Together to the end. Good night.

507
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,351
People! Do not be swayed!

508
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:09,690
Thrust the dark temptations away,
and avoid licentious pleasures!

509
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,777
Embrace only the eternal life!

510
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,780
Just like the ever-shining sun--

511
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,574
WITH KNOWLEDGE COMES ETERNAL LIFE

512
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,119
Live in an eternal world
where there is no death!

513
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,871
That asteroid is a lie, everyone!

514
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,916
They've inflated the economy
by waging wars so far,

515
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,001
and now that it has reached the limit,

516
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:35,675
they are trying to pour
nuclear bombs from space down on us!

517
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,052
Don't be fooled, people!

518
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,805
Don't look over there.

519
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,140
Why not?

520
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,058
It's kinda fun.

521
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,310
You wouldn't know how it feels.

522
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,895
Of course I wouldn't.

523
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,814
I never had a dad.

524
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,318
The best dads
are the ones who aren't around.

525
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,154
Do not be swayed!

526
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,407
Our future selves are waiting for us.

527
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,659
Hey, wait up!

528
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,512
Eternal life is science!

529
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,182
It's not a mere religion, you idiots!

530
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,187
Kids, why just you two?

531
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,190
-Where's the other kid?
-I put some bonus clips on it.

532
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,525
That's no way to make money!

533
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,319
Got any Japanese or American porn?

534
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,904
Uncensored, homemade ones?

535
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,614
We don't sell stuff like that.

536
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,533
Oh, right. You're minors.

537
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,912
If you happen to get some good stuff,
let me know.

538
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,580
I'll make sure to pay you right.

539
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,624
We don't take Korean bills.

540
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,626
We accept US dollars or ration tickets.

541
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,961
Quite picky, aren't you?

542
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,715
Hey, the CO is here.
It's the CO! Hurry up!

543
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,355
KIDS ARE NEAR THE SHELTER
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM

544
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,606
Change shifts.

545
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,941
Change shifts!

546
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,151
Remove magazine.

547
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,402
Remove magazine!

548
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,490
Ammunition, clear.

549
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,284
-Hand over magazine.
-Hand over magazine!

550
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,498
-Ammunition, clear!
-Empty magazine, clear.

551
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,166
-Insert magazine.
-Insert magazine!

552
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,251
Insert magazine.

553
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,925
Park Jin-seo, Yoo So-min!

554
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,177
Didn't you get my text?

555
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,847
Go home before the siren goes off.
Get out of there.

556
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,812
-Gye Hyang.
-Yeah.

557
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,898
Tell them not to go out of town. Okay?

558
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,068
Sure, I'll make sure to tell them off.

559
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,737
The kids are just bored, you know.

560
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,323
They can't go to school
because of the asteroid.

561
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,701
You guys.

562
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,121
Listen to your teacher, okay?

563
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,624
Don't wander off too far. Got it?

564
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,709
-Okay.
-Yes.

565
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,670
How's business?

566
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,587
SEONJIN STAFFING INC.

567
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,505
It's not bad.

568
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,717
People have no other way to watch videos.

569
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,344
But I still don't get it.

570
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,056
-Why is everything out of service?
-It's only like this in Korea.

571
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,476
It's because they closed down
the network system or something.

572
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,148
What I'm saying is,
I don't get what that has to do with this.

573
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,399
You don't have to get it.

574
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,153
Hey, I should have saved some fun stuff
from YouTube myself.

575
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,613
The app was literally
flooded with videos back then,

576
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,782
so I didn't bother to download them.

577
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,950
He was such an asshole.

578
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,243
What? Who's the asshole?

579
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,581
There's this crazy guy.
He basically shits through his mouth.

580
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,374
Uncensored, homemade, or whatever.

581
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,586
We spend all night
deleting that kind of stuff.

582
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,670
Exactly.

583
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,007
-Ha-yul's right. We need guns.
-What?

584
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,052
Kid, don't even think about it.
It's dangerous!

585
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,721
Not if you want to get killed by someone
before the day!

586
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,389
Okay.

587
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,892
Oh, we need to drop by Ha-yul's place.

588
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,894
-What?
-She left me her bicycle.

589
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,730
She was annoyed
since mine would always break down.

590
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,444
That's very nice of her,
but I'm not sure if we should take it.

591
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,946
This is the Martial Law Command.

592
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,532
The curfew will be in place in one hour.

593
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,411
It is now 10 p.m., August 5, 2025.

594
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,918
Seriously, Ha-yul,
what on earth is wrong with you?

595
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,420
Hey, why are the lights on?

596
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,048
-What's going on?
-Did someone break in?

597
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,050
Maybe they forgot to turn them off.

598
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,719
How can you get your phone
and passport confiscated?

599
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,389
What's going on here?

600
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,890
Ha-yul's parents.

601
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,893
Didn't you say
you saw her off at the airport?

602
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,395
-Give it back!
-Why, you little…

603
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,146
-Oh my!
-What's happening?

604
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,314
Are they fighting?

605
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,565
-Mom, go that way.
-Okay.

606
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,817
They're coming out.

607
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,485
Ha-yul, talk to me!

608
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,072
-Ha-yul!
-Get back here!

609
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,242
-Ha-yul--
-Ha-yul!

610
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,245
-Come back inside!
-Why are you making things worse?

611
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,748
I said I'd crash at my friend's place.
I can't stay in this stupid house!

612
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,835
What friend?
Do you even have proper friends?

613
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,711
I'm not like you, Dad.

614
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,214
None of my friends
are trashy frauds like yours!

615
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,383
I'm sick of living like this again!

616
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,301
-Ha-yul!
-You brat.

617
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,012
-Please listen!
-Hey!

618
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,391
Ha-yul!

619
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,977
Are you okay? It must hurt.

620
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,645
-Don't touch me!
-Oh my.

621
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:40,980
Well…

622
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,401
Did you know that
we didn't make the flight?

623
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,903
No, we just dropped by
to pick up the bicycle.

624
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,905
To answer your question, no.

625
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,408
Well, something came up, so…

626
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,410
It's late. You kids should meet tomorrow.

627
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,287
-Let's go.
-Just give me my phone!

628
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,455
Come here. Hey!

629
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,622
-Ha-yul!
-You…

630
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,170
Keep fighting. I don't care who wins.
You're both the same!

631
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,881
Ms. Oh, you have to keep
my violent dad away from me.

632
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,674
You saw him throw his shoe at me!

633
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,844
I mean, technically,
it was a lightweight sneaker.

634
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,391
Well, it seems

635
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,521
we have interrupted you,
although we didn't mean to.

636
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,439
I apologize.

637
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,275
-No, not at all.
-You don't have to.

638
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,446
Guys, get in the car.

639
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,491
I'm tired. Sleepy as hell.

640
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,617
Ha-yul!

641
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,205
We can't seem to make her behave.

642
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,707
It's our fault for overindulging her.

643
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,625
Hi again.

644
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,668
Good to see you again.

645
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,130
But she isn't a wicked kid.

646
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,924
Right, honey?

647
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,096
Okay, well…

648
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,683
Since they're reunited,

649
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,020
why don't we let her sleep
at my place tonight?

650
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,440
I'll send her back safely tomorrow.

651
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,528
So please don't worry about her.
I'll get out of your hair now.

652
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,738
She'll be with her friends.

653
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,207
When you see a parent beat their child,
you split them up right away.

654
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,795
Get out of the car, sweetie.

655
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,465
Sir!

656
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,176
Ma'am.

657
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,100
Please inspect the soldiers' belongings.

658
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,231
Don't you think that's too much?

659
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,692
They're here serving the country
without any hope.

660
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,571
They'll be stuck in the army
until the asteroid hits.

661
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,741
They need something to motivate them,
but supplies are short and--

662
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,452
It's better that I deal with them,
not the military police.

663
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,454
Is anyone on the lookout?

664
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,706
Yes, sir. I'm watching.

665
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:05,916
I Live Alone!

666
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,546
-We'll start at three ration tickets.
-Three?

667
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,798
One, two, three. Offer closed!

668
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,680
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am! All clear on duty!

669
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,517
-It doesn't look like "all clear" to me.
-There will be an inspection.

670
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,437
Man, what's that smell?

671
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,273
Keep the place clean.
This used to be a classroom.

672
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,108
-Pick it up.
-Yes, sir.

673
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,611
Wash up, guys. It smells terrible here!

674
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,405
You should bathe
even on the verge of death.

675
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,198
As a proud soldier--

676
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,202
We'll seize everything
other than supplies and permitted items.

677
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,543
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

678
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,003
Do your thing.

679
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,880
-Yes, sir.
-Kim Hyeon-sik!

680
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,381
Bring it here.

681
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,467
I saw it. Bring it.

682
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,678
It's nothing shady,
so it shouldn't be a problem.

683
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,598
Individual acts while on duty
and engaging in illegal trades.

684
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:06,644
You violated Clause Three and Four,
Section Four of the Martial Law.

685
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,105
Is that clear?

686
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,940
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,192
Ma'am!

688
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,739
Hae-chan, Woo-chan, get ready for bed.

689
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,075
Yes. Even the visa was fake.

690
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,119
The broker ran away
because he knew we'd get caught.

691
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,913
Yes.

692
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,499
-Hae-chan, draw lots of them.
-Yes.

693
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,418
Anyway, see you later, Ms. Jin.

694
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,754
-Bye.
-Hae-chan, look at this.

695
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,257
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

696
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,926
-What's this?
-Which one?

697
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,427
That's pickled radish.

698
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,096
It's really good!

699
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,597
-You like it?
-Yes.

700
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,099
-Eat up, then.
-Thanks.

701
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,109
Who said you could come into
an army base at night?

702
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,613
I just said I'm a teacher here,
and they were like, "Sure, go in."

703
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,698
So what's up?

704
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,867
What is it?

705
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,710
Ms. Jin.

706
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,754
A while ago,

707
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,340
someone moved into the house next door.

708
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,344
Some days, fancy cars are parked outside,

709
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,889
and it's noisy with loud music.

710
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,274
I clearly remember.

711
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,030
It was the man
who massacred my classmates.

712
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,247
You know the Joint Investigation Unit
won't do anything about it.

713
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,049
So she couldn't leave the country?

714
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,343
No. She's staying at her friend's place.

715
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,638
She said
it was because of her parents fighting,

716
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,224
but I'm sure she's afraid
to be near that guy.

717
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,270
You should look out for the kids.

718
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,109
Is that it?

719
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,196
I look out for them, and that's it?

720
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,949
-Do you have nothing else to say?
-Like what?

721
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,911
I'm just sad the kids found out

722
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,122
about the things that you and I know.

723
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm sure you feel sadder.

724
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,879
She's basically asking me
to kill that bastard.

725
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,757
He should've been dealt with
before it came to this.

726
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,637
But my unit doesn't have any power.

727
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,390
The firearms we carry on guard duties?

728
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,185
Most of them aren't loaded.

729
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,562
We don't have bullets.

730
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,024
By the rules,
all firearms should be loaded

731
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,027
with one blank
and at least ten live rounds, but…

732
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,865
we're not getting any
since the ammo theft.

733
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:13,580
My guess is that the theft was staged,
but I have no one to talk to about it.

734
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,457
Why would they do that?

735
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,213
Why?

736
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,132
299 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

737
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,717
Special Missions Unit, pull out.

738
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,011
The rebel leaders are escaping.
We must stop them.

739
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,556
I repeat. All units, withdraw!

740
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,933
I can't follow an order
to let the rebels escape.

741
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,851
Hey, Kang!

742
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,186
Let's shoot warning shots first.
Open fire.

743
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,115
Cease fire!

744
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,534
That's punishable by death!

745
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,786
Captain Kang In-a! Kang!

746
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,705
Kang In-a!

747
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,003
The commander was instantly discharged.

748
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,091
He said he gave the order to open fire
and took the rap for it.

749
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,803
Thanks to him, no charge for me.

750
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,600
A light punishment for insubordination
during an emergency.

751
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,897
But then they sent me
to a supporting unit in my hometown.

752
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,276
I'm treated like a total outcast.

753
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,448
I guess, for the higher command,
I'm an easy target to pick on.

754
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,576
But you know what?

755
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,997
I'm going to hold out until the end.

756
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,335
I guess you should.

757
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,754
Right.

758
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,432
But, hey…

759
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:56,934
What?

760
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,603
What do we do about those bastards?

761
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,063
Just let them be?

762
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,735
The kids are only 14 years old
with about 200 days to live.

763
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:10,739
Do they have to live the rest
of their lives around those scumbags?

764
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,867
I saw what they did to my students.

765
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,536
We can only hope
they shoot each other to death.

766
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,254
Take good care of the remaining kids.

767
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,799
And take care of yourself.

768
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,134
Bye.

769
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,228
Yeah, right.

770
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,022
What great advice.

771
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,067
Thank you so much.

772
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,340
SO-MIN: MS. JIN, YOU'RE HOME, RIGHT?

773
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,652
Hey.

774
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,196
-Where are you going?
-You scared me.

775
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,490
Why are you so nervous?

776
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,954
Why are you standing out here?
Did you have a fight?

777
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,125
I just saw the lights were on
at Yun-sang's place.

778
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,712
If Yun-sang had come back,
we would have known.

779
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,882
Se-kyung must miss him.

780
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,682
Tell her to call me
if you see her in the morning.

781
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,143
Wait.

782
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,145
-Did you really have a fight?
-Sort of.

783
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,438
Bye now.

784
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,728
This is the Martial Law Command.

785
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,064
The curfew has been lifted.

786
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:45,402
The current time and date
is 05:00, August 6, 2025.

787
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,906
Dial 999 to report crimes
and 333 to report safety issues.

788
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,783
Telephone inquiry…

789
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,037
Martial Law Command public safety HQ…

790
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,350
The congregants think
that Father Baek passed away.

791
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,103
We have to check inside this room anyway!

792
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,690
Today we celebrate
the Feast of the Transfiguration.

793
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,734
Hang up. I have to go to Mass.

794
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,594
Hang on. It looks like
that side needs to be fixed too.

795
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,410
Let us say the earnest prayers

796
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,163
we have prepared for God,
the Father Almighty.

797
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,250
Give us this day our daily bread,

798
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,419
And forgive us our trespasses,

799
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:31,007
As we forgive those
who trespass against us,

800
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,093
And lead us not into temptation,

801
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,596
But deliver us from evil.

802
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,116
You're quite late today.
Five minutes late!

803
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,284
Pass!

804
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,703
She doesn't look well today.

805
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,622
Pass!

806
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,375
I can see your wrist trembling from here!

807
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,419
Go home. Put some ice on your wrist
and take medicine.

808
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,445
I'm really fine.

809
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,905
Just stay healthy. Okay?

810
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,284
Eat up. We need to rely on each other.

811
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,869
To the end, you know.

812
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,248
Okay. Thanks.
