1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,261
I poured some homemade liquor.
Would you like a glass?

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,015
Se-kyung.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,600
I have something to show you.

4
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,357
With this,

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,527
we can leave this place.

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,364
Let's go.

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,870
We can leave together with this.

8
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,083
Se-kyung.

9
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,880
Let's leave.

10
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:58,475
END OF THE WORLD
ASTEROID COLLISION IN 200 DAYS

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,314
ASTEROID COLLISION IMMINENT

00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,203
192 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

23
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,917
-Hey, this place is huge.
-It is.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,002
You could fit 200 soccer fields in here.

25
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,920
You reckon?

26
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,009
Do you think
the US troops left anything behind?

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,512
I bet they did. They left in a rush.

28
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,651
-You think the bike might get stolen?
-Yeah.

29
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,738
We still have 193,
no, 192 days left, so I need it.

30
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,576
Right, some eager idiots out there
might want to steal it.

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,660
Whatever.

32
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,579
That's So-min's number one treasure.

33
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,289
No, that's number two.

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,749
Whoa, then what's number one?

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,003
Ms. Jin.

36
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,258
Are you serious?

37
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,010
-Yeah.
-Your number one was a person?

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,096
I'm worried.

39
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,472
About what?

40
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,435
Ms. Jin's acting a bit strange these days.
She looks down for some reason.

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,520
Like when?

42
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,773
She didn't seem happy
when they caught the bad guys.

43
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,360
The Ms. Jin we know
would've been crazy happy about that.

44
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,361
Strange, huh?

45
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,822
And Yun-sang came back,
so why is she like that?

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,367
Let's sweep the place.

47
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,452
I'll go that way!

48
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,162
-Me too.
-I'll go this way.

49
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,496
You go.

50
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,921
Great people of Woongcheon.

51
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,215
Good news.

52
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,635
The rescue operation from the brothel
was a success!

53
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,387
But it wasn't done
by the Joint Investigation Unit.

54
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,432
And just because
that one place was swept clean,

55
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,851
it doesn't mean that the neighborhood

56
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,938
will become an amazing place
that befits the class of this city.

57
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,606
But for now, attention.

58
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,069
A salute
to our proud Special Warfare veterans!

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,612
We salute you!

60
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,113
We salute you!

61
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,823
At ease.

62
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,201
The JIU must be
pretty bitter right now, huh?

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,037
Drop and give me 50!

64
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,873
By the way,

65
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,461
did the actual owner
of the brothel really just vanish?

66
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,256
Something smells fishy.

67
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,840
Real fishy.

68
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,470
They say the owner vanished.

69
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,514
What about it?

70
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,724
You checked properly, right?

71
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,686
Did you?

72
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,063
In-a.

73
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,773
In-a, wait.

74
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,442
Wait up. Just a second!

75
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,445
I need some water.

76
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,494
Wait here.

77
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,833
I'll give you ten seconds.

78
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,502
"Vanished." That's all you need to know.

79
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,545
What?

80
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,464
My bike.

81
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,966
Use it.

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,970
How much longer will you run?

83
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,058
Wait for me. I'm dying here!

84
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,811
Wait for me!

85
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,535
I forgot this was your place.

86
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,203
Wow.

87
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
Let me go and wash up.

88
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:33,958
I'll see you.

89
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,428
A gang that imprisoned underage girls

90
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,098
and exploited them for prostitution
has been arrested.

91
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,519
Most minors who went missing
after the asteroid announcement

92
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,732
were speculated to have been funneled
into adult entertainment establishments.

93
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,903
Through this incident,
we confirmed this to be true.

94
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,989
Next.

95
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,494
Migration to safe zone countries
has been completely suspended.

96
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,913
For those who have received news

97
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,083
from family or friends
who migrated to a safe zone…

98
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,000
Here.

99
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,629
You can share these
with your friends or sell them.

100
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,048
They were in storage.

101
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,136
I remembered how much Jae-won liked them.

102
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,639
It upsets me.

103
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,605
They left so they could survive.
They are in a safe place.

104
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,859
Some say we're all going to die anyway.

105
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,989
That again!

106
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,206
You know, I had a dream last night.

107
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,376
-A dream?
-I turned on the television.

108
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,670
And the president came on.

109
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,299
What do you call it?
The satellite broadcast or something.

110
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,720
The US president was speaking
into a bunch of microphones.

111
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,556
Well, what did the president say?

112
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,560
"We have done some recalculations
and discovered

113
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,063
that the asteroid
isn't going to hit Earth."

114
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,775
"I apologize
for all the trouble we have caused."

115
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:28,281
The president's face was all red
as they kept bowing to the audience.

116
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,120
You're so optimistic, even in your dreams.

117
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,877
Right, there's no way the US president
would speak a word of Korean.

118
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,883
I miss Jae-won so much.
I don't know what to do.

119
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,139
We're going all the way to the top today.

120
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,559
Hae-chan, can we have a break here?

121
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,812
But you have to find the gems.
Look, you found another one.

122
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,316
Woo-chan, you have so much treasure.

123
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,152
You're a rich boy now.

124
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,654
Let's go.

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,415
Hello.

126
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,834
Hey, So-min!

127
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,254
-So-min.
-Yeah?

128
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,342
Hey, why don't you take the kids
and go play at home?

129
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,595
They seem to be straying
too far from home these days.

130
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,013
Hae-chan's not home again?

131
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,851
That's right. So get moving and find them.

132
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,186
You go!

133
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,022
Don't you see I'm making money right now?

134
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,858
Stop petting the dog
and go look for the kids.

135
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,026
-Fine.
-Go.

136
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,615
The same goes for you too.
Don't wander around, okay?

137
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,866
-Okay.
-Yeah.

138
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,785
Check the playground first.

139
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,371
If they're not there,
check the alleys too.

140
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,626
Good morning.

141
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,591
I understand,

142
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,927
but I'm still upset.

143
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,472
If you understand, why are you upset?

144
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:21,185
Even if you forgot that I was back,
shouldn't you be happy to see me?

145
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,106
You looked surprised
but not in a happy way.

146
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,734
You were startled out of your skin, as if…

147
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,819
"As if"?

148
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
As if…

149
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,036
In the year we spent apart,
which felt like 100 years,

150
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,248
we each went through a different hell.

151
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,551
So it's okay to be a little startled.

152
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,028
Yun-sang. Se-kyung.

153
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,490
-Se-kyung, get in the car.
-Hey, forgive me.

154
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,618
Hey, wait!

155
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
Yun-sang.

156
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,708
I have an important proposal to make.
You have to listen to me.

157
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,918
-What's that?
-Where?

158
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,211
What? Hey!

159
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,965
It's like he sniffed you out or something.
How did he show up right away?

160
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,050
I know, right?

161
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,386
-Se-kyung.
-This is crazy.

162
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,056
Are you going to talk to him?
Can you forgive that jerk?

163
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,642
-No.
-Se-kyung.

164
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,226
Let's go. Yeah.

165
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,897
It's a huge proposal.
You have to listen to--

166
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,650
Hey, Yun-sang!

167
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,568
Yun-sang!

168
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,945
Yun-sang, I have an important…

169
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,590
One, two, three!

170
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,177
Wow, there's so much to eat!

171
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,595
-Do you like it?
-Yeah!

172
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,856
Hae-chan, I miss Mommy.

173
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,400
Me too.

174
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,283
This is yummy.

175
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,418
Hae-chan.

176
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,587
Auntie, sorry. So-min, sorry.

177
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,589
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

178
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,096
Are you okay? You're not hurt anywhere?

179
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,764
Woo-chan, are you okay?

180
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,234
Dear Lord, thank you.

181
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,823
Thank you, Lord.

182
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,285
I'm sorry, okay?

183
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:30,666
I've been so distracted with gold
and all the panic talk going around

184
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,669
that I didn't even know where you play.

185
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,341
I mean, how?

186
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,427
How did you

187
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,764
think about taking shelter here?

188
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,184
I actually came here with Mom before.

189
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:55,649
I said I wanted to live
in a place like this, and she…

190
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,611
Okay, why don't we sleep here
for the night?

191
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,030
Come here, everyone!

192
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,531
Ga-eul, you too.

193
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,408
-What is this?
-"I have butterflies."

194
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,160
-It's scary.
-What was that?

195
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,411
"I have butterflies."

196
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:10,831
Have you?

197
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,583
Have you got butterflies?

198
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,396
At this rate,
we won't last 100 days, let alone 200.

199
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,067
What we need more than ammunition
is food and snacks.

200
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,694
You all keep saying that,

201
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,614
but there's nothing I can do.

202
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,367
Are you saying
you don't have any solutions?

203
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,037
We commanders spend our days
running around begging for food.

204
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,997
Isn't this just wrong?

205
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,543
That's why we told you to let your men go
and hire mercenaries instead.

206
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,337
-Hey, fuck this shit, man.
-What?

207
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,422
Kim Gyu-tae, what did you just say?

208
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,467
What? Do you think
we're just a bunch of idiots?

209
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,471
You suck-ups gave all we had
to those who fled the country,

210
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,473
and now you tell us to let our men go?

211
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,599
You're asking for it!

212
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,019
I can shoot you for insubordination!

213
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,064
Go ahead, shoot me!
That asteroid will fucking kill me anyway!

214
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,907
-Tired, huh?
-No, ma'am.

215
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,451
You seem tired.

216
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,621
Shall we stop by the rest stop?

217
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,415
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,000
Drink!

219
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,585
OUT OF FUEL
DO NOT DAMAGE THE GAS PUMPS

220
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,295
-One more glass!
-Who cares about life?

221
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,880
Bottoms up!

222
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,423
Who made this? It's so good!

223
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,841
What a waste.

224
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,803
Ma'am!

225
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,142
We leave in 15 minutes.

226
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,144
Leaving in 15 minutes. See you, ma'am.

227
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,645
Ma'am.

228
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,608
Thank you for your service.
I was discharged just two months ago.

229
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
Come grab a bite.
We're having budaejjigae.

230
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,487
No, thank you.

231
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,323
It's a woman.

232
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,909
-She's badass.
-The combat support commander, right?

233
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,160
-That's her?
-Yeah.

234
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,412
That's right. She leads a trash unit.

235
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,248
That's not true.
I heard that girl's different.

236
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,376
She's a goner now.
A former Special Missions Unit member.

237
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,711
Really?

238
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,380
During the civil war,
her boss was fired for insubordination.

239
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,257
-Oh dear.
-The unit was disbanded.

240
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,926
And they all scattered.

241
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,261
She was sent here
because she's from Woongcheon.

242
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,846
-Goodness me.
-Really?

243
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,139
Excuse me. Someone's in there, right?

244
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,811
I think I heard a cat. Am I right?

245
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,832
I'm a soldier, by the way.

246
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,793
I couldn't just pass by.

247
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,975
Step on it!

248
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,246
Hold this.

249
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,059
-The Mass?
-Did you hear about it?

250
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,603
-The SMU raided the brothel.
-I get what you're saying.

251
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,065
-Ms. Joo, is that your daughter's unit?
-You can't change things suddenly--

252
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:28,982
Father!

253
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,652
That was no mean feat.
They are an amazing team.

254
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,153
My thoughts exactly!

255
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,822
Father Woo is here.

256
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,200
The deputy mayor swore she'd get rid of it
but couldn't do a thing.

257
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,452
The Martial Law Command and the JIU,

258
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,913
those higher-ups were somehow
related to the brothel.

259
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,706
A symbiotic relationship!

260
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,083
You're so smart!

261
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,377
So good with words.

262
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,878
Father.

263
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,215
They'll go to hell, right?

264
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,761
Well, it's a huge relief.

265
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,597
The missing kids were rescued,
and above all,

266
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,350
I'm glad I can speak of hope
at the joint memorial mass.

267
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,102
Hope? Yeah, right.

268
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,271
Father, that's not
what's important right now.

269
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,188
What?

270
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,526
The deputy mayor wants the memorial Mass
to be much bigger, for the entire city.

271
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,778
What?

272
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,364
She changed the venue
to the city hall square.

273
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,407
City hall?

274
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,450
That makes no sense. How can I--

275
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,827
No, Father.

276
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,665
It seems like the success of the mop-up
has inspired the deputy mayor.

277
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,418
She must be having a surge of motivation.

278
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,669
You have to do it.

279
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,755
Believers and non-believers alike,
we've all been waiting for this.

280
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,175
Think of all the hardships
we went through.

281
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,342
-Yeah!
-You're right.

282
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,345
We just want to get together
to remember the deceased.

283
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,642
Okay. Excuse me.

284
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,978
You haven't given us your answer!

285
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,897
Do it!

286
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,400
-Let's just get ready for the Mass.
-Yeah.

287
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,485
The memorial Mass will be at city hall.

288
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,737
OKTOKKI

289
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,285
First things first,
we have to get the rehearsal down right.

290
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,205
It's your first time
leading a big event by yourself.

291
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,832
So this is how God tests me.

292
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,044
Just thinking about it
makes my legs shake.

293
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,962
Oh no. What do we do?

294
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,841
In the afternoon, a truckload of people
will be coming in for confessions.

295
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,053
Why, thank you for the morale boost.

296
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,722
It's really encouraging. I mean it.

297
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,307
It is what it is.

298
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,892
To be honest,

299
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,188
for the people left here with no options,
the only thing they can do

300
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,690
is confess their sins.

301
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:37,986
Right.

302
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,907
You can do it.

303
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,826
I have to do it.

304
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,913
-It's so hot here!
-Okay.

305
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,248
The AC isn't working well.

306
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,083
-I'll look into it.
-We're fixing it.

307
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,000
Hello.

308
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,335
Ma'am!

309
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:58,465
Having the joint memorial Mass
at the city hall square is a huge task.

310
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,093
We've never done it before,
and we have no time.

311
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,011
I know. I'm aware of it,

312
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,931
but the raid was successful.

313
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:07,849
Right?

314
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,396
We gave the citizens hope that
we could accomplish something on our own.

315
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,148
-Yes, that's right.
-One more thing.

316
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,069
The president's chief of staff said
he'll be attending the Mass.

317
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,195
What?

318
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,738
Is he still in the country?

319
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,907
He couldn't leave.

320
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,912
He said he would be leaving together
with the president and the prime minister,

321
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,665
but the truth is, he didn't make the list.

322
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,051
Mother.

323
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,015
How are your knees? You're seeing
the oriental medicine doctor, right?

324
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,982
Mother, I think you should refrain
from going out for the time being.

325
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,525
Things are chaotic here too.

326
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,319
Don't you worry.

327
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,154
Hey, In-tae!

328
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,323
Cho In-tae!

329
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,161
Enough with this!
You can't avoid your father forever!

330
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,163
Come out!

331
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,832
Just let him be.

332
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,045
We should be thankful that he stays home
and doesn't wander around outside.

333
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,464
It's because you always side with him

334
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,300
that everything just goes to his head,
and he acts like this.

335
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,302
Well, that's what kids are like.

336
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,429
Hey, In-tae!

337
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,308
Cho In-tae!

338
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,644
Cho In-tae.

339
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,939
It's your father. Come out.

340
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,441
Let's talk.

341
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,112
I know you're in there!

342
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,117
When will you grow up?
Are you gonna stay in there forever?

343
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,035
Come out!

344
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,371
Cho In-tae! Come out!

345
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,039
No.

346
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,292
If I come out, you'll beat me!

347
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,878
Just what in the hell
are you doing in there?

348
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,546
You punk!

349
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,134
Come out and eat,
or you can starve to death in there!

350
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,135
I'll behave.

351
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,554
Don't beat me.

352
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,224
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,316
Eat before you go.

354
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,235
No, I have to leave right away.

355
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,324
-Please take good care of my mother.
-Of course.

356
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,700
Thank you for everything.

357
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,497
Oh, and there will be good news soon.
Trust me.

358
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,921
The plants need water.

359
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,339
They're wilting.

360
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,258
Yes, well…

361
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,762
By the way,

362
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,932
despite the migration ban
for high-ranking officials,

363
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:58,770
your family must be escaping soon,
seeing how relaxed you are.

364
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,820
Without my money, he'd have nothing.

365
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,365
He's probably looking for
an immigration sponsor

366
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,868
because he's afraid
I won't offer up my money.

367
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,119
Excuse me?

368
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,788
Being a former prosecutor
and high-ranking official

369
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,707
may mean something here.

370
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,792
But for safe zone countries,

371
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,546
they're free to choose
which immigrants they take in.

372
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,258
What use would they have
for a former prosecutor from South Korea?

373
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:34,681
They will want people with the skills
they need, like scientists and engineers.

374
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,808
Don't you think?

375
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,311
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,730
You're right.

377
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,543
SONG, JIU

378
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,836
Meet me at the memorial Mass.

379
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,589
There's someone you need to meet.

380
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,389
I was with my family
when I entered the facility,

381
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,477
but then I suddenly got dragged away.

382
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,691
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

383
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,166
Confessions will begin soon.

384
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,293
SISTER REGINA - CONFESSIONS AT 2 P.M.

385
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,346
I live in Seoul,
so I don't know this place at all.

386
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,517
Ma'am, I'm safe here, right?

387
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,353
If this is too hard,

388
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,022
you don't have to say any more.

389
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,946
-I can't talk about the training center.
-Training center…

390
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,573
SEPARATED FROM FAMILY AT TRAINING CENTER

391
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,992
Training center.

392
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,286
ADMITTED TO THE TRAINING CENTER
WITH HER FAMILY LAST JUNE

393
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,174
TRAINING CENTER MANAGER IM?

394
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,092
CAPTAIN KANG IN-A

395
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,139
In-a.

396
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,182
Hey.

397
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,059
What's all that stuff?

398
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,396
You should be asking about her instead.

399
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,233
She has a number of injuries.

400
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,402
Take care of her. I have to get back.

401
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,320
Okay.

402
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,365
I'll get going now.

403
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:02,203
You can direct your questions to her.
She knows a lot of people who can help.

404
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,955
Okay.

405
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,879
Hey, that's it?
You should at least introduce us…

406
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,093
Let me. It'll be better if I carry it.

407
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,261
It's okay.

408
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,183
Let's head inside.

409
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,732
Captain?

410
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,733
Yeah?

411
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,319
I think I saw her picture
in the central lobby.

412
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,570
-The school lobby?
-Yes.

413
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,075
"Proud alumni of Cheondong.
Chae Young-ji."

414
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,286
Private Na, you are one of them too.

415
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,121
She went to an elite university.

416
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,501
It's 20 minutes to base, right?
I'm gonna get some shut-eye.

417
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,003
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,301
The results are good.
No diseases to worry about.

419
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,595
Drink up.

420
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,599
Ms. Jin, this is her ID card.

421
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,607
I'll take a quick look.

422
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,442
PERSONAL MEDICAL RECORDS
CHAE YOUNG-JI

423
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,536
How did you get all these injuries?

424
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,954
I just fell.

425
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,043
Unit 306, Building 12?

426
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,878
I live in Unit 305.

427
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,883
You live next door to Ms. Jin.

428
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,928
But how come we've never met?

429
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,306
I've rarely visited home
since I went to high school.

430
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,351
I guess we missed each other.

431
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:52,605
I was here until I finished university.
I moved out when I started working.

432
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,191
I was assigned to Cheondong Middle School
two years ago.

433
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,072
Two years ago…

434
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,872
Those who have been saved
will live in a dazzling heaven on Earth.

435
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,373
Give us our money back!

436
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,627
After the flames cover the sky
and the ground melts from the hot fire,

437
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,464
under a new sky promised to us,

438
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,425
we will find a new land
where there's no death or pain…

439
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,093
Where did you hide the kids?

440
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,603
Chae Young-ji.

441
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,278
The system of order on Earth
has been destroyed,

442
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,909
and now we must follow the principles
of the universe to return to our roots.

443
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,289
All life on Earth will cease to exist.

444
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,211
After the flames cover the sky
and the ground melts from the hot fire,

445
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:01,591
we will start a new life
in a beautiful place.

446
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,470
You are all standing
in the dominion of salvation.

447
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,848
Come this way.

448
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,227
Come in. It's okay.

449
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,983
This way.

450
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,739
It's fortunate that you don't have
any dead or missing family.

451
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,410
I guess some are meant to leave
and some come back.

452
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,040
Capt. Kang used to serve in Icheon,
but returned as part of a supporting unit.

453
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,000
Sit down here.

454
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,295
You have to report your return
to get your ration card.

455
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,179
Se-kyung!

456
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,099
Yun-sang, did you come
to get your ration card?

457
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,561
Who is that?

458
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,649
Woongcheon's second returnee
after Ha Yun-sang.

459
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,946
In-a brought her here.
I'm helping her report her return.

460
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,409
-She lives next door to me.
-Next door?

461
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,910
Yeah, Unit 306.

462
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,125
Young-ji.

463
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,629
This man lives in Unit 205.
He's our neighbor.

464
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,886
It's nice to meet you.
I came back recently too.

465
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,140
Then I guess there's hope.

466
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,353
Hope? Is there someone you're waiting for?

467
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,191
Ms. Jin.

468
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,737
You can get your ration tickets here.

469
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:55,079
I'm telling you this because Capt. Kang
wanted us to keep an eye on her.

470
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,208
Those cuts and bruises
aren't from an accident.

471
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,961
-She was assaulted.
-What?

472
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,172
She denies it.

473
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,720
But I looked up the physical exam records
for graduates of Cheondong Middle School.

474
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,139
-And her parents--
-You found her parents?

475
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:19,020
Her mother, Do Jeong-a, went missing
in the pyramid scheme incident.

476
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:41,292
REMAINING FAMILY MEMBERS
CHAE YOUNG-HAN

477
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,380
CHAE YOUNG-JI, 22ND ALUMNI CLASS
ADMITTED TO POSTECH

478
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,222
We have a new student from Ulsan--

479
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,515
My name is Na Hyeon-jae.

480
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,685
I'm an idol trainee.

481
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,314
Quiet! Let's see, you can sit--

482
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,649
That seat's empty.

483
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,901
Next to Chae Young-ji?

484
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,865
Open your books.

485
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,950
Hi.

486
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,828
Are you Young-ji?

487
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,913
I told you
to clean the board before class.

488
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,234
She has a cat.

489
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,278
Awesome!

490
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,195
It's a cat.

491
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,249
I hope we can be good neighbors.

492
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,295
Thank you for everything.

493
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,713
Have you had dinner?

494
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,883
It's okay. I have some food left.

495
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,469
You should have a home-cooked meal
now that you're home.

496
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,887
This guy's a great cook.

497
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,889
Yes, he is!

498
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,768
We'll leave some food out here
and ring your bell twice.

499
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,396
Thank you so much.

500
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,483
Get some rest.

501
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,028
Ms. Jin, was that really a cat?

502
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,696
-Quiet!
-I wanna stroke it!

503
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,283
Let's let the girl and the cat rest
so they can settle in.

504
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,035
-Be quiet.
-Can we really stroke it?

505
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,036
It's so cute!

506
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,871
Yeah, it was really cute.

507
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,040
But you guys are even cuter. Go!

508
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,010
-Ji-eun!
-Hey.

509
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,261
Hey, you're here.

510
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,763
All right.

511
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,015
JOINT MEMORIAL MASS - AUGUST 17
CITY HALL MEMORIAL SQUARE

512
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,103
I assume we all have things
to confess before we die.

513
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,773
Ji-eun, what sins have you committed?

514
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,109
It's nothing like that.

515
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,780
You know, it's the least I can do
to get through these times.

516
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,574
Yeah, that's right.

517
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,229
Mi-ryeong.

518
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,066
Where's Se-kyung?

519
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,069
In the hideout, with the Three Musketeers.

520
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,533
About Min-ho…

521
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,204
Are you okay…

522
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,337
No one is okay.

523
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,174
But

524
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,386
we can't just go on feeling sorry
for each other until the end.

525
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,684
Is that why Se-kyung can stay so strong?

526
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,193
You should leave.

527
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,112
I know that's why you're here.

528
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,575
The two of you should leave quietly
to a safe place right now.

529
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,622
Mi-ryeong!

530
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:08,392
LIFE SCIENTIST HA YUN-SANG
13TH ALUMNI CLASS, CHEONDONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

531
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,894
-Captain.
-Yeah?

532
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,979
Do you know him or what?

533
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,481
Dr. Ha Yun-sang.

534
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,567
Cheondong Middle School's hero
and a Nobel laureate in the making.

535
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,029
He's cute.

536
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,532
-Mess Sergeant.
-Yes?

537
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,534
Why do we only have seven fertilized eggs?

538
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,621
Captain, seven eggs is an awful lot.

539
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,331
I used the salt water trick.

540
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,168
You put all the eggs
in concentrated salt water,

541
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,671
and then you pick out the ones that sink.

542
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,257
I'll have to monitor these ones
for another eight days.

543
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,633
-Salt water?
-Yeah.

544
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,511
Is that method scientifically proven?

545
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,807
Now, that's something
I never really thought about.

546
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:54,188
But if these babies hatch later on,
grow up, and start laying eggs,

547
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,108
then they'll provide us
with some protein, don't you think?

548
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,778
Look at the boys' faces.

549
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,530
They're all malnourished.

550
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,451
The command sergeant major said sausages
will be coming in to the supply depot,

551
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,287
but there's no way we'll get any.

552
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,914
-Fuckers.
-Sergeant First Class So.

553
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,542
Yes?

554
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:15,960
Tell me,

555
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,713
why is my name on this--

556
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,134
Hush now, Captain.
The babies can hear you.

557
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,473
Why don't you name it "Hush"?

558
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,143
You need to be careful
when changing names, Captain.

559
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,477
Why is that one "Chun-sik"?

560
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,396
That's my father's name.

561
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,356
So Chun-sik.

562
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,859
IN-A, MIMI, PUPPY, KISS

563
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:47,116
Father, I'm just asking. If I were to say…

564
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,662
that I am pregnant…

565
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,340
should I keep the baby?

566
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,928
All life…

567
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,432
is the will of the Lord.

568
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,231
Thank you, Father.

569
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,873
I am jealous of those who abandoned
this neighborhood and left.

570
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:41,712
If I could, I would take all the money
I could get my hands on and leave.

571
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,050
Father, are you listening?

572
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,802
Yes, please go on.

573
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,886
So…

574
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,809
I…

575
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,315
For two years, when Father Baek was here,

576
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,904
I made donations
to the church extension funds,

577
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,991
and now I keep thinking
that I want that money back.

578
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,210
I can't stop thinking about it,
and it tortures me

579
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,547
that I'm even thinking such things,
and I feel guilty.

580
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,798
Sister.

581
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,715
Yes?

582
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,844
What you have to remember is

583
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,387
that the Lord

584
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,807
is always by our side.

585
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,894
No. I think he's only with the rich folks
who've got it all.

586
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,772
Goodness, I…

587
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,652
I'm having these thoughts again.

588
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,822
I will repent of my sins.

589
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,388
Good job, Father.

590
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,849
I've been waiting for so long.

591
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,060
Don't tell me you're here to confess.

592
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,315
Of course not.
I'm a law-abiding citizen, you know.

593
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,151
Sure.

594
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,236
What's up?

595
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,863
Hong Gi-pyo.

596
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,616
That bastard showed up.

597
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,533
What?

598
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,996
Man, that guy's as shameless as ever.

599
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,582
He got on his knees
and said he was sorry, but…

600
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,878
I think he's plotting something.

601
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,795
What are you…

602
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,342
Lord,

603
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,887
please forgive these poor little lambs.

604
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,436
What could he be up to?

605
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,231
If he was really sorry,
he shouldn't have come to you.

606
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,441
Are you going to rehearse
for the memorial Mass?

607
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,528
Is Jin-seo not here yet?
I told him to come too.

608
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,445
Oh, right.

609
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,531
There he is.

610
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,366
Hi, Father. Hi, Sister.

611
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,117
-Hi, guys.
-Hello.

612
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,911
Yun-sang, can you wait?

613
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,788
Okay.

614
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,255
Don't ring that now, Andrea.

615
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,132
What?

616
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,387
I mean, this memorial Mass
isn't going to be at the church.

617
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,389
It will be at the city hall square.

618
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,350
We can't afford any mistakes, Father.

619
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,601
What if I make a mistake?

620
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,228
The audience will laugh at you.

621
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,146
Please, call them "believers."

622
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,824
Yun-sang.

623
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,453
In my sermon, should I say something
about international politics?

624
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,788
You know about that stuff.

625
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,333
Forget it. Stick to what you know, Father.

626
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,585
Okay.

627
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,796
Oh, and about the liturgy that day,

628
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,132
is Sister Sophia from Group 8
going to handle it?

629
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,635
Yes. Someone from Group 8
will be the lector as well.

630
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,472
I'm not sure
if the choir could get together.

631
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,308
They won't even have time to practice.

632
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,519
I think I'll have to meet
Brother Kang Joseph.

633
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,610
Can I help you?

634
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,862
I came for a confession.

635
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,988
Sung-jae.

636
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,574
-Are you a member of the church?
-A member? No, I'm not.

637
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,786
If so, please go to the education center
and register for a catechism.

638
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,747
We offer a fast-track course now.

639
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,874
There's a fast-track course?

640
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,543
Sister's got sales skills!

641
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,172
Oh my, Jesus!

642
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,381
Yun-sang!

643
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,299
Come out.

644
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,719
No one here
is going to hear your confession.

645
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,646
Don't you really wanna know
what the big proposal is?

646
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,358
You think I'm here
just to ask for forgiveness?

647
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,736
You know what it's like.

648
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,990
Seniors in any lab are bound to be evil.
I went through the same thing myself.

649
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,575
That's what you came to tell me?

650
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:23,994
No.

651
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,830
Right.

652
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,625
I shouldn't have done what I did.

653
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,008
Okay, fine.

654
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,178
When Prof. Hong told me
to set up the new project,

655
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,180
I pocketed 300 million won from the funds.

656
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,934
I framed you for it, and I know
you went to the US to avoid me.

657
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,186
It was truly persistent slander.

658
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,147
It's why Se-kyung suggested I leave.

659
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,565
Yeah.

660
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,111
I wronged you.

661
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,324
What, do you want me to get down
on my knees again?

662
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,287
Hey.

663
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,790
You're still naive, aren't you?

664
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,636
Our entire lab is moving
to a class-one safe zone.

665
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,724
But in order to get there, we need you!

666
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,854
Do you even know
why you had to go through all that grind?

667
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,649
You were nothing but a lab nerd.

668
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,528
I bet you had no idea
how your experiments were being used.

669
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,449
See? You've got to be kidding me.

670
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,202
You don't know, do you?

671
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,790
But I know exactly how you can be of use!

672
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,255
Global funds have their eyes
on this project.

673
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:02,134
It's organized by one of the Vatican's
asset management companies.

674
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,554
And it's made a fortune
during the asteroid crisis,

675
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,974
so funds and foundations in Korea
are dying to hop on this train!

676
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,059
They're all going crazy over this!

677
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,939
I have no idea what you're saying.
How do I even trust you?

678
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,485
This is the backdrop behind
all the missing public figure cases!

679
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,114
Those in charge of big public funds,
where did they run off to?

680
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,074
What?

681
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,910
You want an example?

682
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,122
The mayor of Woongcheon.

683
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,083
No. There's another one.

684
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,712
How about your godfather?

685
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,049
Father Baek Sang-Hyeok!

686
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,233
Hey, In-a!

687
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,153
Open the window. Open it!

688
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:11,370
You were going to pass by me, weren't you?
You and that temper of yours.

689
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,705
Just tell me what you want.

690
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:17,543
I mean, you came all the way here,
right in front of your mother's house.

691
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,295
How can you not drop by once?

692
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,214
Because it's your house, not ours.

693
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,104
I can't believe that brat is my daughter.

694
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,941
They don't provide medicine,
but they give out a lot of these.

695
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,110
Why don't you drink one?

696
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,778
I'm okay.

697
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,657
Has anyone seen
the mother of the girl in Unit 306?

698
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,118
I don't think
I've ever spoken to the mother.

699
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,954
I live next door,
and I've never even seen her.

700
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,458
I heard her son left school in first grade
to go to an alternative school.

701
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,752
Her daughter went to
a science high school.

702
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,133
Maybe that's why
their mother was never at home.

703
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,094
You all have such big mouths.

704
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,013
So the word is out already.

705
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,893
Unit 306 is the family that got caught up
in that pyramid scheme mess.

706
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:20,063
That's right. I remember the father
coming to our church to meet Father Baek.

707
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:24,234
Min-ho was so excited to have a friend
who was good at math and science.

708
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,320
But he suddenly transferred.

709
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,490
It was rumored that the mother
ran the pyramid scheme herself.

710
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,661
But I had no idea
that they had a daughter that old.

711
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,000
Even Hong Gi-pyo knew about it.

712
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,170
You're a priest of this church,
and you didn't know?

713
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,011
Sung-jae.

714
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,516
Has Father Baek really gone missing?

715
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,521
You can't reach him,
but that doesn't mean he's missing.

716
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,277
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

717
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,863
I don't know anything about that stuff.

718
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,156
You really don't know?

719
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,119
Or are you hiding things from me?

720
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,121
Hey, Yun-sang. You shouldn't…

721
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,376
Hey, you can't just barge into his room!
Please calm down.

722
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,711
Look, I wish I had something to hide!

723
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,798
If I knew something,
why would I hide it from you?

724
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,553
What is it that you do know?

725
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,555
Hey, Ha Yun-sang!

726
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,057
Listen.

727
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,811
Do you think I enjoy being in the dark?

728
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:47,484
If Father Baek were alive, if he were
still in this world, as you say,

729
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,780
do you think
he would've left us like this? Do you?

730
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,324
Tell me!

731
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,843
It's In-a's bike.

732
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,597
Se-kyung.

733
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,436
Look at this. She ate it all.

734
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,189
"Thank you for the delicious meal."

735
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,357
What a relief.

736
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,361
I'm glad. You were worried about her.

737
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,362
Exactly.

738
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,286
Good night.

739
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,872
I'll see you in the morning.
Well done today.

740
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,123
Bye!

741
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,541
Yeah, bye.

742
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,235
Damn it!

743
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,282
-Father!
-Damn!

744
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,828
No one can open that door.
Unless there's a fire.

745
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,333
Father Baek was the only one
who knew the passcode.

746
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,009
What do you think happened, by the way?

747
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,844
What?

748
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,931
"Father Baek has already passed away."

749
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,518
Or "He has already fled to a safe zone."

750
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,023
Maybe I've been too oblivious,

751
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,069
as a priest and as a human being.

752
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,115
May I ask

753
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,076
what you are on about all of a sudden?

754
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,995
I was under a big umbrella
by the name of Father Baek,

755
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,664
so maybe I thought that…

756
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,128
I didn't have to know about
all these problems.

757
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,172
It's good that you didn't have to know.

758
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,258
You know what?

759
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,885
That, too, is power.

760
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,139
Ignorance. It's a privilege for the few.

761
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,060
Yes, ignorance.

762
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,985
I really hope

763
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,489
that tomorrow never comes!

764
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,160
What's with him?

765
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,872
Throwing a fit won't stop it from coming.

766
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,719
This is the Martial Law Command
of Woongcheon.

767
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,762
The curfew has been lifted.

768
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:08,351
The current time and date
is 05:00, August 17, 2025.

769
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,566
Father.

770
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,748
-Disaster brings new beginnings.
-Once the darkness passes, a bright light…

771
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,340
Chae Young-ji.

772
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,291
Tae-mi.

773
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:02,716
Tae-mi.

774
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,110
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

775
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,162
Young-han's playing
is getting better by the day.

776
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,665
I wanted to see Young-ji too.

777
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,460
She says she's not feeling well.

778
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,257
We can't take them all with us.

779
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,138
But we have to take Dr. Ha Yun-sang.

780
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,350
Yes. Of course we do.

781
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,602
I'm counting on you, Father.
