1
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:14,682
My first love,

2
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,784
and on top of that,
the sweetest

3
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,420
first kiss...

4
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:23,119
I would have them tonight.

5
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:29,356
My first kiss tastes
sweeter than anything

6
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:32,557
no tastes like chilli

7
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:35,560
...chilli?

8
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:52,511
What is it?

9
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,679
Are you O.K.?

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,256
What is it?
Are you alright?

11
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:01,289
I'm allergic to capsaicin!

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,690
My first kiss

13
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:03,890
We just kissed!

14
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,126
Only kiss!

15
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,768
tasted like red hot chilli.

16
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,832
I put my tongue inside.

17
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,470
Wait outside.

18
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:13,632
Yes, he and I were
not meant to be.

19
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,506
Someday, he will come to me.

20
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:20,248
And also will
the sweetest love of my life.

21
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:24,615
LOVE CLINIC

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,214
I prefer noir to melodrama

23
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,126
and baseball to musical.

24
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:32,160
OH Ji-ho

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,288
Oh, the opera we saw last time
was worst of all.

26
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:39,194
Also prefer straight to perm hair
and for the lips,

27
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:41,997
prefer the natural color
to the strong one.

28
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,867
KANG Ye-won

29
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:45,400
Anything else?

30
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:50,405
Yes, heels, the kill heels.
I really hate them.

31
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,912
Also very bad for your feet.
It's hard on the spine.

32
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:57,312
Should I continue?
I have more than hundreds to go.

33
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,357
You should've listened to me

34
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,325
Directed by KIM Arron

35
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,156
when I told you
I'm not interested in you.

36
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:10,364
I understand how you feel
so I could take the water.

37
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,623
Go ahead.

38
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:30,076
Hey! I said I could take the water!

39
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,185
Hey, not this.

40
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:39,758
What's so special with you?

41
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,625
Dumbass.

42
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:56,500
Dumbass? Gosh, I think
I'm a bit better than that.

43
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,207
Damn it.

44
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,479
Take off your pants, please.

45
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,146
And underwear too?

46
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:07,816
Of course.

47
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,631
Are you having erection?

48
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:24,799
I didn't intend to but...

49
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:29,542
you are a woman, doctor
and female touch

50
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:31,169
anyway turns me...

51
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,381
Try to imagine other things
and focus on the treatment.

52
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,577
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:44,252
Let's start.
Going in. Relax.

54
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:45,890
Wait!

55
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,054
Don't push too hard, please.
It's my first time.

56
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,223
Going in.

57
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:07,546
100 grand?
Are you kidding?

58
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,640
How could I afford

59
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,153
the sudden raise of 100 grand
for the security deposit?

60
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,621
You're a doctor.
You should have some savings!

61
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:20,495
Also if you raise 100 grand
who would be able to move in?

62
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:23,658
He agreed with the amount.

63
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,236
Hey, Mister.

64
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,404
You want that flat
with additional 100 grand?

65
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,202
You shouldn't.

66
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,442
There is market value
and you should follow it.

67
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:48,283
Is it a problem to pay
additional 100 grand or a million

68
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,017
when the flat is available?

69
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,751
I guess the one who can't afford
should leave the flat.

70
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,264
I just get another one available.

71
00:05:57,298 --> 00:06:00,734
You can move in any time
and it has a better view!

72
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,269
Let me take a look first.

73
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,069
Guess her flat
has a bad luck.

74
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,036
You're quite lucky.

75
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,542
What an asshole!

76
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,657
Will start the operation.

77
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:27,552
Scalpel.

78
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,302
HEALTHY SEX FOR EVERYONE

79
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:52,084
Highschooler?
You need to focus on studying...

80
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:56,823
The size doesn't matter.

81
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:03,255
Women don't find the size important.

82
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,536
Any potential client you found?

83
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm trying hard.

84
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,310
We have an appointment at 5PM.
Has he come yet?

85
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:20,575
He has but took off right away
when he knew you're a woman.

86
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,510
It's not easy for them

87
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:24,414
to show theirs to
a strange woman

88
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,747
if not for sex.

89
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:28,618
You think it's easy for me
to look at theirs?

90
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:33,424
They should appreciate it
when their doctor is beautiful.

91
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,362
Let's go have some fun.
It's Friday night.

92
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:37,692
Not today.

93
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,356
Doctors' association meeting.

94
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,233
Are you already done
with the boyfriend?

95
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:47,702
We lasted for two months,
which was long enough.

96
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,850
If his were this size...

97
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:00,077
just as big as this,
I would have been faithful.

98
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,118
With all my royalty.

99
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,321
GOOD DOCTORS
- MEDICAL SERVICE OF LOVE

100
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:22,132
When we went for the
volunteer service last summer,

101
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:24,000
Dr. Gil truly amazed me.

102
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:27,638
She did all the tough treatments
by herself...

103
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,004
She was great.

104
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,738
No, thank you.

105
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,404
No, thank you.

106
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:37,082
It's spicy and good.
Try this.

107
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:38,947
Enjoy yourself.

108
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,646
Does he hate spicy food?

109
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,487
He's more than perfect!
Oh, my!

110
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,756
We are surely meant to be!

111
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:02,239
- Dr. Gil.
- Yes?

112
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:07,642
How about a cup of tea
no, dinner sometimes?

113
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:10,910
Good.

114
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:13,419
Wait.

115
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,674
You scared me to death!

116
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,547
That's what I want to say.

117
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:45,778
What brought you here so suddenly?

118
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,948
That's what you can say to your mom
who came from the States in 2 years?

119
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,026
You should've at least called.

120
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:54,452
Wait.

121
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,827
I can smell something...
You've got a man!

122
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,160
Of course.

123
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,595
A man with a whole
different class.

124
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:02,226
Wake up, little girl.

125
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:05,364
Men are all same.
Two balls and one dick.

126
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,964
You should know better.

127
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,741
Isn't this hip puff?

128
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,479
Guys go crazy
if you wear it.

129
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,055
Size 1?

130
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,383
You don't even know
your daughter's size?

131
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,052
Size 1 doesn't fit me.

132
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:29,026
You should be careful.

133
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:31,222
If your size
goes bigger than 1,

134
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,096
that's when men leave you.

135
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,725
I don't care.

136
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,600
But actually they do not leave me.

137
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,369
By the way, the guy
with a different class.

138
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:43,603
What is he like?

139
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:48,674
Just kind, caring
and smart.

140
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,050
To make it simple,
everything opposite to dad.

141
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:57,015
When are you going
to divorce him?

142
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,819
Are you going to
take care of me?

143
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,794
Sure. Just leave him.

144
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:03,057
You can live with me.
I can afford that.

145
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,732
Use that for your wedding.

146
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:08,903
I know you have almost nothing.

147
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:37,848
Will call you when I get back.
Way to go, you bitch.

148
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:21,041
At this early morning?
I don't believe this.

149
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:37,945
Is this a joke or what?

150
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:57,549
Can't take it anymore!

151
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,880
ON PATROL

152
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,032
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

153
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:20,200
I came down as
it was too noisy.

154
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:22,540
Who is it making all the noises
drilling on the wall?

155
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:25,045
I guess it is #701
as he just moved in.

156
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,945
Please tell him

157
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,450
I can sue him for
the noise complaint issues.

158
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,508
Okay, ma'am.

159
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:34,454
Oh, there is a package for you.

160
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:35,521
I see.

161
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,488
Oh, it's wet.
Do you need a plastic bag?

162
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:43,029
No, thank you.

163
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,763
Great.

164
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:57,409
Gosh...

165
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:01,348
It's for the education.

166
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:02,878
Didn't ask.

167
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:07,144
But the education must
be quite intensive, I guess?

168
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,590
You said you didn't ask?

169
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,226
I just got curious
as you told me.

170
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,826
Wondering how you can
use all these.

171
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,261
There is an expiry
date for condoms.

172
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:21,394
- I know that.
- You do?

173
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:23,572
People usually
don't know about it.

174
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,600
Hello, I just moved in.

175
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:29,769
Need a parking permit.
I am #701.

176
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:31,611
I see, please wait a bit.

177
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:37,345
Hey!
You live on the 7th floor?

178
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,054
Yes.

179
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:40,279
Gosh.

180
00:14:41,223 --> 00:14:43,316
Wondering what kind of
asshole drills on the wall

181
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,859
in the daytime over weekend.

182
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,952
And it was you!
I should've guessed!

183
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,832
It's my house and
I can do whatever I want.

184
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:53,769
Then what about my case
interfered by the noise

185
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,964
while taking a rest?
At my own house!

186
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,197
You must be single.

187
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:03,606
Let me give you an advice
from the professional point of view.

188
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,840
Unbalance of hormones

189
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:09,245
due to inability of natural actions
is also disease.

190
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:12,013
Disease?
What inability?

191
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,076
You saw it?

192
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,952
Why are you calling me a patient?
What was I incapable of doing?

193
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,894
Fuck hormones!

194
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,551
Answer my question!

195
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:22,428
Hey!

196
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,193
Damn it.

197
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:27,466
I think it must be this big.

198
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,272
What is it?

199
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,505
Maybe a bit bigger than that.

200
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:39,403
Or is it premature ejaculation?
No, it's erectile dysfunction.

201
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:43,747
- What dysfunction?
- Impotence it is.

202
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,581
Why are you so embarrassed?

203
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:49,054
Your arrogant behaviors
and big actions including drilling

204
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:52,821
to condescend to others are
all packaged and exaggerated.

205
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:56,398
Because you do not feel confident
when your pants go down.

206
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,296
Where are you looking at?

207
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,196
I am just trying to locate it
as I cannot see it clearly.

208
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:04,864
Locate what?

209
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:14,172
This place surely
has a bad luck.

210
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,676
For your healthy sexual life,

211
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:20,984
our clinic executes medical checkup
and protection.

212
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,117
So please come visit us
in the near future. Okay?

213
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:28,159
What do you feel
to see it like this?

214
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,095
Mine is a bit bigger than that.

215
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,566
Size is nothing to brag about.
You need to brag your healthy penis.

216
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:39,039
Got morning glory every day.
Isn't it a sign of healthy penis?

217
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:40,666
It's one of them...

218
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,639
But erection is not everything.

219
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,509
This part is called prostate

220
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,416
where the semen is created.

221
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,348
Doc!

222
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,317
Cut the crap and
share your first experience!

223
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:58,893
And you will put
your hands on my banana?

224
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:05,599
Listen! Doctor here
will not touch yours!

225
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,930
It's me who touches 'em!

226
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:17,844
I DON'T GET EXCITED
EVEN SEEING HOT GIRLS.

227
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,674
Oh, Mr. Roly Poly,
what should I do with you?

228
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:28,015
TRY TO FIND PARTNER'S
INNER ATTRACTION

229
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,059
THAN LOOKING FOR
THE PHYSICAL EXCITEMENT.

230
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,729
THANK YOU FOR
LISTENING TO ME, DOC

231
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,627
CALLER ID: HYUN-MIN

232
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:41,862
Hello.

233
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:47,337
Our dinner appointment...
How about tonight?

234
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:49,270
Tonight?

235
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:53,744
Please hold on,
need to check my schedule.

236
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:04,352
Sorry to keep you waiting...
I just checked it

237
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,858
and luckily I'm free.

238
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:57,943
Guess he is going to tell me!

239
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:04,616
Well...you said you have
something to tell me.

240
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,714
Yes...

241
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,485
Don't know what you would think
if I tell you this...

242
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:19,598
But I am telling you
because you're very nice

243
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,660
so you could understand me well...

244
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:27,771
Just say it!
I'm ready

245
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,208
So...

246
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:35,245
What should I tell him in return?

247
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:37,976
I would look too cheap
if I say yes right away...

248
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,423
Would you please
circumcise me?

249
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,890
I like that.

250
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:46,218
Pardon?

251
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:51,397
Circumcise?

252
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,801
I thought about this a lot

253
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,038
as it would be bad
to get married without doing it.

254
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,938
Cheer up!

255
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:10,118
At least we have some surgery
to do in a very long time.

256
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,814
It cheers me very much.

257
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:14,946
The operation would last
about 30 mins.

258
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,354
We'll put you
under anesthesia now.

259
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:17,983
Make it look good.

260
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,859
We cannot operate
when it is erected.

261
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:30,870
It's not.

262
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:35,074
Doc., it just broke the record.

263
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,004
Quiet.
What should I do?

264
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:41,407
Unbelievable.

265
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:01,730
Excuse me...

266
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:04,094
could you please help me?

267
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:05,138
Pardon?

268
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,938
With parking...

269
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:25,821
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

270
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:28,426
I just helped because
I didn't want my car gets scratched.

271
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,992
Mister.

272
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:01,456
You should park the car.

273
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:05,263
Hey! Take a look.
There is no parking slot!

274
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:06,961
Not a space for a bike.

275
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:10,333
I only had a small glass
but called you.

276
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:13,203
Parking is inclusive in your cost.

277
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:14,639
Damn it.

278
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,644
You paid me with mileage!

279
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:18,436
Why did you bother to call us
if you drank so little?

280
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:19,946
You could've driven yourself.

281
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:21,607
Why were you so cautious?

282
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,983
Looks like you never get drunk
even if you drink tens of bottle!

283
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:30,423
I even don't pay
with mileage myself!

284
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:35,961
Gosh! What's wrong with him?

285
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,698
This is the space for two cars!

286
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:47,138
What the hell are you?

287
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,814
Okay, I will teach you a lesson.

288
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:00,650
Not answering?

289
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,558
Pick up the damn phone!

290
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:09,690
It bugs me!

291
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,089
Answer it!

292
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,031
18 MISSED CALLS

293
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,907
Damn.

294
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:27,979
#701.

295
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,652
It's your last day on earth.

296
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:35,752
Hello.

297
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:37,925
- A package delivery for you.
- Delivery?

298
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:40,360
Got it.

299
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:51,734
What delivery
at this late hour?

300
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:08,151
What is he doing
with the door open?

301
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,089
Hello?

302
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:11,693
Excuse me.

303
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,724
Hello.

304
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,322
What the hell...

305
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,624
Anybody home?

306
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:25,071
Answer!

307
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,576
Look at this.

308
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,909
This bastard is well off.

309
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:41,446
What is it?

310
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:44,252
It's the cream for your thing.
Try it.

311
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,988
I bought it in Thailand.
Made with elephant's snot!

312
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:48,825
What?

313
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,392
Like flaring up!

314
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:56,395
Can you call yourself a doctor
saying those kind of things?

315
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:58,940
Don't send me
those shits anymore.

316
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,632
That's really expensive...

317
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:12,410
He's real dumbass.

318
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,853
I almost missed the beginning!

319
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:21,596
He's the only one
who cares about me.

320
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,359
Let me take a look.

321
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:30,705
Power max? Let me try.

322
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:40,208
I did nothing wrong.

323
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,383
It's all because of his lousy parking!

324
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:11,210
What is that dirty bastard doing?

325
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,910
It's good!

326
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,507
Fucking pervert!

327
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,823
Why do I have to hide like a bugler?

328
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,538
What?

329
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,283
- What are you doing here?
- Go away, you pervert!

330
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:54,413
Answer my question!

331
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:56,281
Hell no!

332
00:26:56,591 --> 00:27:00,550
What should I do?
Go away, you bastard!

333
00:27:00,695 --> 00:27:02,060
What the hell...

334
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:04,189
What...

335
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:12,306
WEEKEND REALITY SHOW:
ONE NIGHT AND TWO DAYS

336
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,510
How's it with Min-jun?

337
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:19,943
He's just a sex partner.

338
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:21,972
Will leave him shortly.

339
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,385
As I found a new prey.

340
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,719
A guy at the same apartment.
Handsome...

341
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:31,155
and seems to be quite rich.

342
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,526
How old is he?

343
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,695
Early or mid 30s?

344
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:39,861
Is he tall?
Has double eyelid?

345
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,298
Almost 6 feet tall...

346
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,437
and has double eyelid.

347
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:47,501
How about his hands?
Good hands?

348
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,836
What are you trying to do now?

349
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,771
Don't even think about it.
He's not that kind.

350
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,945
- Please leave it here.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:01,782
And please...

352
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:05,422
move that to the end of here.

353
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:14,929
Gil urologist?

354
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,496
HEALTHY SEX FOR EVERYONE
- GIL UROLOGIST

355
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:22,000
- Let's eat. I'm starving.
- Yes, Doc!

356
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:35,520
Lovely...

357
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,026
I heard that he's No. 1
in vagina contraction.

358
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,126
Guess he is the one.

359
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:49,164
- All done? Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:55,866
How about a drink?

361
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:58,036
- Love it!
- Your treat?

362
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:59,146
Of course!

363
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:02,542
- Hi, Gong-joo!
- You work here?

364
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,344
Yes.

365
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:09,523
- You know him?
- Yes, very well.

366
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:14,527
One night
and two days!

367
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:18,695
Let's go.

368
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,462
Fuck...

369
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:26,670
Really?

370
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:31,772
This place is nice.

371
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,745
Gosh, doc!

372
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,384
Oh!

373
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,619
Damn it.

374
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:44,082
Great.

375
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,124
Let's join to get closer
as we are neighbors.

376
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:49,389
- Yes!
- We don't have to.

377
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:52,063
We can drink separately.

378
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,122
Let's sit.

379
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:56,235
How do you do?

380
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:03,040
- One night and two days.
- Hey!

381
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:05,839
What should we order?

382
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:10,646
This place is famous
for the spicy seafood noodle.

383
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:13,516
Our doc cannot eat the spicy food.

384
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,485
If you are treating us,

385
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:19,593
how about sea cucumbers?
The biggest size?

386
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:24,161
Here!

387
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,570
The place's spicy noodle rocks!

388
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:38,878
Soju always goes well with
spicy noodle.

389
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,676
Help yourself.

390
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:46,083
Told you I can't eat spicy food.

391
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,678
You're a Korean.
It doesn't make any sense.

392
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,358
You look 100º/º Korean.

393
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,460
Perfect!

394
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,700
Anyway let's try to get along
as we are on the same floor

395
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,801
even though I don't like you.

396
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:11,004
Drink up and
give me back the empty glass.

397
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:14,411
Sharing a glass
is beautiful Korean tradition!

398
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,473
- Don't you think?
- Of course!

399
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:26,891
Damn dirty bastard.

400
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:32,054
Drink.

401
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,010
A female urologist...
it's nonsense.

402
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:52,683
How about a man checking boobs

403
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:55,185
and putting a hose
into the vagina?

404
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:58,387
There are tons of male obstetricians.

405
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:01,724
Then why can't women
be urologists?

406
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:09,962
If there is lack of female hormones,

407
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,832
there shows the atrophy
of reproductive organs.

408
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,308
I think you belong to that case.

409
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,002
I'll give you

410
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,769
the special hormone treatment

411
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,212
at a half price.

412
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:31,421
So variety shows give you a hard-on?

413
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:34,784
Then...
how about Pororo?

414
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:38,797
Pororo...Porno
sound similar.

415
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,465
That was!

416
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:43,298
What? I saw everything.

417
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,170
I guess you are not confident
with long-term relationship?

418
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:47,902
You can't get it up
in the morning?

419
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:50,706
Shall I prescribe Viagra for you?

420
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:54,243
Maybe you would watch variety show
all night after taking it.

421
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:57,284
- For one night and two days?
- No, it was!

422
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,686
Wait.

423
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,914
Kleenex.

424
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,793
Sorry for that.

425
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:10,726
It's nothing...
Just drink on the sweater.

426
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:22,407
Sorry.

427
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,146
You son of a bitch!

428
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,549
Wait for me!

429
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:37,950
Where are you going?

430
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:41,728
Is a dog barking somewhere?

431
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,730
What are you going to do
with my head?

432
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:45,924
You owe me an apology!

433
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:48,201
You forgot who started first?

434
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:50,060
You owe me an apology!

435
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:52,030
Watch your mouth!

436
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:55,132
Crazy pervert.

437
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,541
Stop right there!

438
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:39,114
Did any girls from our school
choose urology as major?

439
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:40,321
No.

440
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:44,215
She is the pervert.
I can see that.

441
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,655
It's hysteria. Spinster hysteria.

442
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,263
And her hip puff was
almost triple of her real size.

443
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:56,267
Here we go.

444
00:34:58,373 --> 00:35:00,000
Go easy.

445
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,666
Don't make a fuss.

446
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:05,308
Thank her for not poking your eyes.

447
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,677
Don't say that.

448
00:35:08,883 --> 00:35:11,579
I didn't intend to take off her clothes!

449
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:13,551
I just slipped...

450
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,382
Damn it.

451
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:21,426
He has no manners...

452
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,387
He forced me

453
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:28,834
red pepper powder floating soju
with his dirty hand.

454
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:30,836
You know what I mean?

455
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,997
Why are you laughing?

456
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:36,009
It's funny to see you
talking about a woman.

457
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,042
A woman?

458
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:40,813
No, she's not a woman.

459
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,811
- Do you think it's funny?
- Yes.

460
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:48,246
I almost sued him.

461
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:49,880
Should I sue her?

462
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,652
It's over 1 hour already.

463
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:52,488
What?

464
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:56,689
You've been talking about that
pervert guy over 1 hour, my friend!

465
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:59,733
I've been talking about girls...

466
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:02,136
No, you haven't.
For last seven years

467
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:03,763
since you became the specialist.

468
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:06,538
How was it with Young-chul?

469
00:36:07,108 --> 00:36:08,700
Don't even mention it.

470
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:11,770
I reached multi-orgasm...

471
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,471
and experienced true paradise.

472
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,440
- Really?
- Yes.

473
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:18,880
What does it feel?

474
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,520
It's too difficult task for me

475
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:23,716
to explain the multi-orgasm
to the girl who never reached one.

476
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,381
I completely understand.

477
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:29,129
You have troubles with your erection
as you see too many female genitals.

478
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,424
Ain't I right?

479
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,265
That's just psychological.

480
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:37,201
You need to overcome.

481
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,099
Or...

482
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,438
You can find another identity
like I did.

483
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,105
Here he comes!

484
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:57,157
- Darling!
- Young-chul!

485
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,952
This is my bestie, Doctor Gil.

486
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:05,766
This is my fiance, Kim Young-chul
a son of Taesung Hospital's owner.

487
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:06,892
You should meet him.

488
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,027
He's a friend of Young-chul's.

489
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:12,833
As good as Young-chul,
even though a little bit less.

490
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,839
Thank you for your kindness.

491
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:21,746
But I have things to do
this weekend so maybe later...

492
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,249
- Look.
- Something on my lips?

493
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:31,616
You know what?
The guy upstairs.

494
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:34,693
His name is Wang Sung-gi.

495
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,422
What a name!

496
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:40,394
Took the top
when entered school.

497
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,731
And one of top three
for vagina contraction.

498
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:46,762
The amount of income tax returns
last year was more than 500 grand.

499
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,206
On top of it!

500
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,939
His hobby is to dump girls!

501
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:55,615
Beautiful, intelligent, glamorous...
he dumps all.

502
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:58,978
It's not fun if he's too easy.

503
00:38:09,764 --> 00:38:12,927
You need to grab onions
and choose the sturdy one.

504
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,334
- You remember me?
- Yes...

505
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:24,672
Cucumbers should have
vivid color and juicy end.

506
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:27,079
This looks good, doesn't it?

507
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:33,185
- Are you interested in me?
- Pardon?

508
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,291
Gosh.

509
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:47,827
Maybe...

510
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,802
we can shop together?

511
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:52,935
It's too depressing to do it alone
on weekends.

512
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:56,267
- Is it good?
- Yes.

513
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,111
It's really good.

514
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:01,709
Wanna try?

515
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,247
Open your mouth.

516
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:08,644
Isn't it good?

517
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,959
The fun gets double
when you shop together.

518
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,085
I hate that son of a bitch.

519
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:18,563
It's me.

520
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,495
The blind date
you talked about...

521
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,071
Set as many as possible.

522
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,832
I can meet
at least 2 men a day.

523
00:39:28,476 --> 00:39:30,535
And make sure
you don't set any doctor.

524
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,747
I hate doctor.

525
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,876
There are so many
perverts among them.

526
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:42,451
Especially no obstetricians.
I'd rather die.

527
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,416
Bye.

528
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,287
Sorry. It must be heavy.

529
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:51,530
Heavy thing is
the lady's worst enemy.

530
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:03,702
I want to treat you.

531
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:10,574
Please wait a bit.
It would be ready shortly.

532
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:12,479
It's really okay.

533
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:18,151
I would like to
show my gratitude.

534
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:23,561
Who was that woman?
You two know each other well?

535
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:27,300
She runs urology clinic
next to our clinic.

536
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:30,162
Are you a doctor?

537
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,531
Dentist or dermatologist?

538
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:36,041
Obstetrician.

539
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:38,338
I knew it.

540
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,805
You seemed very professional.

541
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:47,911
I should've done better
if I had a bit more time.

542
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:51,152
Bon appetit.

543
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,832
Can I just call you sweetie?

544
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:13,736
Help yourself, sweetie.

545
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:29,891
Then let's do double

546
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,426
- for the safety.
- No.

547
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,767
I want triple.

548
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:38,036
No.
I suggest double

549
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:39,128
as it looks better.

550
00:41:39,173 --> 00:41:41,733
It's the thing I would wear
so make it triple!

551
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:46,542
This is already quite big!

552
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:47,808
If you insist that size

553
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,349
we need to think about
the side effects.

554
00:41:49,483 --> 00:41:51,212
Enough.

555
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:54,478
It's going to be me
who has side effects if any.

556
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,094
Let's decide on this.

557
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:03,763
We cannot make it that tight.

558
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:08,699
It's the present for
our 20th anniversary.

559
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:11,932
When we were newly-weds,
he came to me tens of times a day.

560
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,599
But now he turns his back
even I spread my legs!

561
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:18,075
From doctor's point of view,
that's not possible.

562
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:21,312
I heard about you already.

563
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:24,316
Just make me like a virgin.

564
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:28,481
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

565
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:32,158
It's been a while
since we did a surgery!

566
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:34,258
Good job.

567
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:37,727
A clinic can't afford
to get behind the rent.

568
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,331
How come ob/gyn doesn't do
the maternity treatment?

569
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:52,068
I'm sorry but
it's our doctor's policy.

570
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:54,910
What kind of policy is it?
Is he really obstetrician?

571
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:56,513
My apology.

572
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,050
We don't have a delivery facility...

573
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,450
What kind of clinic is it?

574
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:06,588
It's done.

575
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,625
If your husband cheats on you
even after you do this...

576
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:13,564
- just cut his thing.
- Cut?

577
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:15,498
You're doing this
only to please his thing,

578
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:17,936
and if his thing doesn't fulfill
its duties, it shouldn't exist.

579
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:20,396
Let's schedule the surgery
two weeks from now.

580
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:22,805
And you should be careful
after the surgery.

581
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:26,511
Next patient.

582
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:39,985
Thanks for the hard work, everyone.

583
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:43,856
- Shall we go dancing tonight?
- Really?

584
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:47,097
Why don't you join, Gong-joo?

585
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:49,360
Yes, you should!

586
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:51,235
No wonder...

587
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:54,034
for the guy who only cares money
but not expecting mothers.

588
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:55,768
enjoys going to club,

589
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:57,935
drinking and hooking up the girls.

590
00:43:58,078 --> 00:44:00,638
Doc. he can hear it!

591
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:02,473
Can he?

592
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,848
And she needs a blind-date as
she cannot find anyone on her own.

593
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:12,751
Maybe match making
is already too much for her...

594
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:17,997
Oh, can you hear it?

595
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:20,892
I talked to myself.

596
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:23,660
By the way,

597
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:26,069
I forgot that I had a date tonight.

598
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:29,299
Fuck the date.

599
00:44:30,511 --> 00:44:31,569
Elevator is here. Let's go.

600
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,480
Good-bye.

601
00:44:34,848 --> 00:44:35,815
Bye.

602
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,484
Hello, In-young.

603
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:42,850
I just called...

604
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,118
to keep our promise
to drink wine together.

605
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:50,260
Yes.

606
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:04,767
No, it's nothing.

607
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:09,676
By the way,
I guess you're running now?

608
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:12,209
Yes.

609
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:18,649
See you soon, sweetie.

610
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,327
Yes.

611
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:22,425
What was it?
You were too soft.

612
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:28,328
It's the guy who made me
want to break up with you.

613
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:52,021
You are killing me tonight.

614
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:59,729
Told you
this is good-bye sex.

615
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:29,674
I have some friends
from that school.

616
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:32,144
I've got some friends
from your school.

617
00:46:32,348 --> 00:46:33,610
You are class of which year?

618
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:35,282
2002.

619
00:46:35,718 --> 00:46:37,151
Class of 2002?

620
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,778
It means...

621
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:41,751
- Are you in 30s?
- 30s?

622
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:43,988
Yes.

623
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:46,227
Oh, you are.

624
00:46:46,362 --> 00:46:49,456
Okay then...
you studied at medical school.

625
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:50,428
Yes.

626
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,831
What's your major...

627
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:53,960
Urology.

628
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,031
Urology?

629
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:01,001
What's wrong with
a female urologist?

630
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:03,204
Nothing.

631
00:47:07,249 --> 00:47:08,511
Do you often see...

632
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:12,145
The thing?

633
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,922
The thing.

634
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:19,254
Yes, everyday.

635
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:26,226
Then do you like
thick ones or long ones?

636
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:29,169
What do women prefer?

637
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:31,466
I just don't know
what women like.

638
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:32,631
Please tell me.

639
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,140
- Look.
- Yes?

640
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:38,106
I can say the long and thick one

641
00:47:38,347 --> 00:47:40,508
is better than
the short and thin one.

642
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,448
Long and thick one.

643
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:47,721
Long and thick...

644
00:47:50,726 --> 00:47:52,318
Is it the question you can think of?

645
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:57,296
What a loser!
Shall I kill him?

646
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,595
Don't leave me!

647
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,703
Of course, the thick and long is better.

648
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:10,678
Don't you think so, ma'am?

649
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:15,814
Korean men have so small dicks.

650
00:48:16,118 --> 00:48:17,278
I know it all.

651
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,287
Sex is...

652
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:22,747
not just about moving
forward and backward.

653
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:24,483
That's not it.

654
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:28,563
The bastards who know
nothing about women's minds

655
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:31,656
ask whether we like it or not
after the sex.

656
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,867
I've never liked it. Never.

657
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:37,402
I just pretended.

658
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,167
You have done that too, right?

659
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:40,333
Right?

660
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,142
Fucking morons
think I liked it a lot.

661
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,596
I guess I walked too much today.

662
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:06,829
My legs are swollen.

663
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:15,867
Let's toast.

664
00:49:25,187 --> 00:49:26,711
By the way,

665
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:28,946
do you work-out?

666
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:30,852
Look, In-young...

667
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:34,293
I think we should drink
some other time.

668
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:39,434
Wait.

669
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:44,529
I must be crazy.

670
00:49:45,507 --> 00:49:48,135
Men don't know their exact sizes.

671
00:49:48,477 --> 00:49:51,469
You think your things are big?
But truth is all yours are tiny.

672
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,207
Just come to our clinic.

673
00:49:53,382 --> 00:49:56,579
Koreans' dick size is small.

674
00:49:56,919 --> 00:49:58,181
I know what's eating you.

675
00:49:58,254 --> 00:50:01,485
I can turn them
into magic sticks!

676
00:50:02,524 --> 00:50:05,254
I can make five times bigger
than your size now.

677
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:07,352
When it's erected!

678
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,055
Have you seen mine?

679
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:11,265
Why you talk that shit
even without seeing it?

680
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,164
I can tell just by looking at you.

681
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:16,236
I can enlarge them.
Satisfaction guaranteed!

682
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:19,899
Damn... is she nuts or what?

683
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,068
- Wait!
- Why am I nuts?

684
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,274
I apologize, it seems
my friend is already wasted.

685
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:28,709
Who the hell are you?

686
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:36,256
I'm her boyfriend.
I am sorry.

687
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,555
- Boyfriend?
- Let's go.

688
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,328
What are you doing here,
sweetie?

689
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,561
You'd better keep her
in good custody.

690
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,466
She has a slutty tongue.

691
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:50,398
You called me a slut?

692
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:53,574
You son of a bitch!
You called me that?

693
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:57,908
Your banana is thick but short.

694
00:50:58,213 --> 00:50:59,510
And yours?

695
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:01,682
It's long but thin.

696
00:51:01,784 --> 00:51:03,911
Ain't I right? Right?

697
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,988
'Cause I'm a damn smart urologist.

698
00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:10,786
- She drives me crazy.
- I make your dick like this.

699
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:13,020
- What's that bitch, fuck.
- How about that?

700
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:14,889
I will kill that bitch!

701
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:17,925
You sons of bitches!
Be quiet!

702
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,904
When I am telling you that
I can make yours this big.

703
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:26,407
Why do you yell at me?

704
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,701
You goddamn bitch!

705
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,443
Please.

706
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:36,718
Would you just stop?
Quiet!

707
00:51:36,752 --> 00:51:38,310
Shush!

708
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:24,959
You damn freak!

709
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:29,265
What did you do to me
last night?

710
00:52:29,371 --> 00:52:31,236
- What?
- What did you do?

711
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:33,365
Tell me what you did to me!

712
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:35,536
Do you ask me that?

713
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,142
It's nonsense.

714
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:45,415
Shush!

715
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:50,085
I am sorry.

716
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,467
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

717
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:07,235
Are you close to Sung-gi?

718
00:53:07,576 --> 00:53:08,668
Who?

719
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:11,011
Dr. Wang on 7th floor.

720
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:12,703
Never in my life!

721
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:16,044
Great then!

722
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:17,274
What's great?

723
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:20,879
I'm quite into him.

724
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,047
So what?

725
00:53:22,424 --> 00:53:25,587
- Could you help me, ma'am?
- Why should I?

726
00:53:26,094 --> 00:53:28,892
And why do you call me ma'am?

727
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:34,795
I'm 28.
Are you younger than me?

728
00:53:41,276 --> 00:53:43,938
I'm not finished...
That restless bitch...

729
00:53:46,782 --> 00:53:49,376
She always makes my day, damn.

730
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,766
Here you go.

731
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:25,184
It's quite neat
for a bachelor's place.

732
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:33,725
- Here's the place!
- People say he's the best!

733
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:39,734
- The leaflet?
- Here it is.

734
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:47,837
Only this kind of promotion

735
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,435
WE EMPOWER YOUR MAN!
can get us
that kind of success.

736
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,039
Listen.

737
00:54:56,552 --> 00:54:59,544
What does it mean
if nothing happens

738
00:54:59,655 --> 00:55:02,556
when a man and a woman
spend the night together?

739
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,148
He must be a dickhead.

740
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,055
Or she's such a bummer.

741
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,294
Hello.

742
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:11,622
But why are you asking that?

743
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:14,133
Nothing.

744
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:38,214
Damn it.

745
00:55:41,196 --> 00:55:43,460
What the heck.

746
00:55:43,932 --> 00:55:46,298
You morons.

747
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:50,695
I'm a doctor, you hear me?

748
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,866
I am a fucking doctor!

749
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:59,309
You should listen to me!
Damn morons!

750
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:07,954
What a mess she is!

751
00:56:34,282 --> 00:56:36,079
You can't even call her a woman.

752
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:39,416
Such an ominous thing.

753
00:56:57,739 --> 00:56:59,730
- Doctor!
- What?

754
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:02,899
Why?

755
00:57:03,478 --> 00:57:04,911
It's...

756
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,175
- The patients are...
- What about them?

757
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:10,216
Think you should come out and see

758
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:13,846
- unless you're busy.
- Of course not.

759
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,422
It's nothing.
What about the patients?

760
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:19,853
Is it women's fault
if it got loosened?

761
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:21,121
No!

762
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:23,863
You made kids
looking like your husbands.

763
00:57:23,932 --> 00:57:25,524
And that's what made it
loosened like this.

764
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,792
That's right!

765
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:30,138
We women are not always
satisfied with their job, right?

766
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,332
Then why don't they get
the enlargement surgery?

767
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,670
Let them get it done!

768
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:37,208
- Not us?
- That's what I'm talking about!

769
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,414
It's medically explicable
where to suck it

770
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,905
to turn your woman on.

771
00:57:43,118 --> 00:57:45,882
I can provide it, ma'am.

772
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:47,716
Do you all understand?

773
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,053
First book a session with me.

774
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:51,752
Confidentiality guaranteed.

775
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:54,193
Phone consulting is possible,
so call me anytime.

776
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,854
Anyone who doesn't have this?

777
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:04,804
Only hyenas steal
the meat others got.

778
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,238
So you call your patients 'meat'?

779
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,213
What do you know about them?

780
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:18,947
They feel guilty and victimized
when their husbands cheat on them.

781
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:20,818
Do you understand them?

782
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,789
Why do they should feel that?

783
00:58:22,891 --> 00:58:25,553
They want to be young again
at all costs because of that,

784
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,824
and it requires a big courage
to finally come to me.

785
00:58:29,097 --> 00:58:30,530
Do you understand any of this?

786
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:33,733
Well...

787
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:36,735
How can a spinster
understand their feeling?

788
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,997
What? Spin...

789
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:42,175
Say it to me again!

790
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:43,241
Hey!

791
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,143
You rude bastard.
I will have you pay for this.

792
01:00:08,118 --> 01:00:11,053
The operation went well.
Nothing to worry about.

793
01:00:11,188 --> 01:00:14,817
And don't forget abstinence
for 2 weeks no matter what.

794
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:17,222
Oh my, you're naughty.

795
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:18,823
Thank you, doctor.

796
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:21,056
- Take care.
- Good bye.

797
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:27,101
Please don't do it!
Let go of her!

798
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:31,504
- You're that bitch doctor!
- You might kill her!

799
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:34,805
Don't you have to help?

800
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,208
Why should I?

801
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:42,282
Doc!

802
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:45,080
Please let go!

803
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,256
Why did you make
my husband's dick so big?

804
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:51,860
He asked for it!

805
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:55,123
You deserve this, bitch!
Can you call yourself a doctor?

806
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,222
What are you doing?

807
01:00:56,433 --> 01:01:00,335
He was already cheating on me,
now what should I do?

808
01:01:00,504 --> 01:01:02,529
What are you doing at the clinic?

809
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:05,138
Who the fuck are you?

810
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:10,304
- Are you a doctor?
- My hair!

811
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:15,885
Don't pull it!
Hands off!

812
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:26,593
Don't be so depressed.

813
01:01:28,332 --> 01:01:30,391
I've been through
several of this fuss.

814
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:37,229
Can you call yourself a man
beaten up by a woman like that?

815
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:43,007
My motto is to safeguard women.

816
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:46,844
So you saw me as a woman?

817
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,980
You're not?

818
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,084
Then why did you do that
the other night?

819
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:54,623
Why about then?

820
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,891
- I wanted to protect you.
- What?

821
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:04,667
It's not right thing to do.

822
01:02:05,068 --> 01:02:09,129
To do a girl who's drunk
only because I'm turned on.

823
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:10,365
I am not that kind of man.

824
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,035
But does it mean...

825
01:02:15,212 --> 01:02:17,373
you saw me that kind of man?

826
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:19,739
What did you take me for?

827
01:02:20,951 --> 01:02:22,475
I'm not a beast!

828
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:28,452
She shouldn't misunderstand
about 'protect'.

829
01:02:38,301 --> 01:02:41,532
Could you hold...

830
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,464
hold that, please?

831
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:58,754
Damn it.

832
01:03:03,994 --> 01:03:05,586
I wanted to protect you.

833
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,197
Protect you.

834
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:12,926
What?

835
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:16,704
You just said 'damn it.'

836
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,007
Did I?

837
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:21,468
I did not!

838
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:37,550
Good morning.

839
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:51,702
What do women think

840
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:54,511
when they hear from a man,
'I want to protect you'?

841
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:55,375
What?

842
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:58,648
What does a girl think
when a man tells her

843
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,172
that he wants to protect her?

844
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:04,077
Well...she should think
he has feelings for her.

845
01:04:04,788 --> 01:04:05,880
Why is that?

846
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:08,280
Listen to me.

847
01:04:09,693 --> 01:04:13,424
I don't have feelings for her.
I think she's irritating.

848
01:04:13,497 --> 01:04:16,261
And I don't want to protect her.
I don't need to.

849
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:19,233
It just came out of my lips.
Out of blue.

850
01:04:20,837 --> 01:04:22,828
She won't misunderstand, will she?

851
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,102
I'm not sure.

852
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:31,847
CALLER ID: IN-YOUNG

853
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:36,418
You got to have a man at home.
Don't you think?

854
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:40,416
You have something to eat
for breakfast tomorrow?

855
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:42,116
I have some beef bone soup.

856
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:43,725
No, thank you.

857
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:46,322
I can prepare it quick.

858
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:55,929
Ouch!

859
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:58,767
Are you alright?

860
01:04:59,342 --> 01:05:00,331
I'm fine.

861
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:01,637
Let me take a look.

862
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,847
Do you have a first-aid kit?

863
01:05:04,948 --> 01:05:08,782
I just wanted to make sure
that you have breakfast.

864
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:11,411
You didn't have to.

865
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,727
Look, In-young.

866
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,375
Why don't we cut it here?

867
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,606
Don't take me as a slutty girl.

868
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:37,504
Wait!

869
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:39,281
You look like that!

870
01:05:39,716 --> 01:05:41,013
I mean...

871
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:43,581
What I mean is that...

872
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,244
I want to protect you.

873
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:47,146
You don't have to.

874
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:06,941
Listen to me, In-young!

875
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:09,844
The truth is...

876
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:13,273
Impotence?

877
01:06:14,451 --> 01:06:16,112
That's what he said.

878
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:20,714
Poor thing.

879
01:06:20,824 --> 01:06:24,127
It must've been an agony
as his body didn't react

880
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,027
while his mind wanted me so badly.

881
01:06:32,669 --> 01:06:33,601
Why do you laugh?

882
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,500
Don't you realize
that you're dumped?

883
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:38,736
He said he's impotent!

884
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:43,006
Fuck impotence.

885
01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:46,181
Even these mushrooms
laugh at you, darling.

886
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:53,651
You are right.

887
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,487
There's no way that
he can't get it up at all.

888
01:06:58,828 --> 01:07:02,855
CAN YOU TELL
ME ABOUT YOUR ACCIDENT, ROLY-POLY?

889
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:09,436
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU FOR LONG.
ARE YOU CURED?

890
01:07:14,978 --> 01:07:16,912
HELLO, DOCTOR
- ROLY-POLY

891
01:07:17,013 --> 01:07:19,607
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
WAS WORRIED! ? GIL UROLOGIST

892
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:29,225
I GOT IT UP RECENTLY
FOR A GIRL.

893
01:07:29,225 --> 01:07:31,853
CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU BODY DOESN'T LIE.

894
01:07:33,797 --> 01:07:36,095
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

895
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:41,535
YOU MUST LIKE HER A LOT. LOL

896
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:51,208
Next patient is ready.

897
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:53,746
Let her in, please.

898
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:56,012
This way, please.

899
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:13,567
I think I felt the lump
in my boob recently.

900
01:08:25,682 --> 01:08:27,206
- Where?
- Right here.

901
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,117
I see.

902
01:08:33,757 --> 01:08:35,054
There's none.

903
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,084
None at all.

904
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:45,065
Wait, In-young!
What are you doing?

905
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:47,260
I am all set.

906
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:51,831
I don't need to see there.
Nurse Kim!

907
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:56,845
It was right after
I became a specialist.

908
01:08:57,447 --> 01:09:00,177
so I was not really used to
that kind of emergency.

909
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,319
Since that medical malpractice...

910
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:06,880
Have the other girls bought
that kind of lie?

911
01:09:15,498 --> 01:09:16,760
It's hot in here.

912
01:09:18,635 --> 01:09:19,693
I think it's fine.

913
01:10:06,816 --> 01:10:08,443
In-young, enough is enough!

914
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:11,613
You don't really get horny?

915
01:10:15,592 --> 01:10:18,254
This doesn't turn you on?
At all?

916
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:21,423
Listen, In-young...

917
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,269
Shut your mouth,
you damn eunuch!

918
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:33,736
Son of a bitch.

919
01:10:35,378 --> 01:10:37,107
Damn fucker!

920
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,917
Good, keep going!
It really turns me on!

921
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:45,515
I tried real hard!

922
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:48,116
I will make you pay for it!

923
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:49,521
Definitely!

924
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,426
Why don't you just
go out with him?

925
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:57,190
You never know if he's the one
that you've been looking for.

926
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:00,492
No way.
He can never be.

927
01:11:01,271 --> 01:11:04,206
He really likes spicy food.

928
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:07,475
I don't like how he looks like.

929
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:09,679
Those cloying double eyelid...
Just hate that.

930
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,045
Zero respect for women.

931
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,710
But...

932
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:18,342
But what?

933
01:11:19,589 --> 01:11:24,652
I can't get off
that one sentence from my mind.

934
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:26,658
What's that?

935
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:30,431
I wanted to protect you.

936
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:31,864
Protect you.

937
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:35,527
What is that one sentence?

938
01:11:42,178 --> 01:11:44,305
I can guarantee,
he is the man...

939
01:11:44,414 --> 01:11:45,278
For what?

940
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:47,177
For your orgasm.

941
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:48,950
No, thank you.

942
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:51,609
It's sooner or later,
believe me.

943
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:07,461
- Doctor Gil.
- Hello.

944
01:12:09,005 --> 01:12:10,472
What brought you here?

945
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,838
It's the wedding of the son
of Taesung Hospital owner.

946
01:12:13,176 --> 01:12:14,336
How about you?

947
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:17,071
The bride is a close friend.

948
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:19,071
Who's this?

949
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:21,440
Oh, I told you the other time.

950
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:23,753
The urologist from the clinic
next to my last clinic.

951
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:25,186
This is my fiancee.

952
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:28,046
- How do you do?
- Hello.

953
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:33,856
He bragged about a girl
who has the serious crush on him.

954
01:12:33,963 --> 01:12:35,794
I shouldn't have bothered at all.

955
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:37,761
You didn't mention that
she's a withered woman.

956
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:38,731
Darling...

957
01:12:39,202 --> 01:12:42,535
Doctor Gil,
don't get it wrong, please.

958
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:45,869
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you, honey.

959
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,970
Hyun-min, it's a surprise to see you.

960
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:54,549
How's your clinic?

961
01:12:54,784 --> 01:12:57,719
Going really well as I inherited
the place from you.

962
01:12:57,854 --> 01:13:01,290
You surely can sense
where to find money.

963
01:13:01,691 --> 01:13:05,855
I was never good at it.

964
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,725
Don't be so modest.

965
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:09,024
Don't you remember?

966
01:13:09,132 --> 01:13:11,123
The daughter of our professor at faculty.

967
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,725
You went after her for her fortune.

968
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:17,062
You've been so good at
finding rich girls from back then,

969
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,468
- voila, you finally made it.
- Hey, watch your mouth!

970
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:21,976
It's alright.

971
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:24,612
You shouldn't be ashamed of
your ambition.

972
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:27,372
She would value that.
Don't you?

973
01:13:29,585 --> 01:13:32,577
I see my darling got the bouquet.

974
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:36,649
Then... I will see you later.

975
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,558
Just keep walking as
they're still watching.

976
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,230
Don't look back.
Keep walking like this.

977
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:49,765
But what brought you here?

978
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:52,469
I went to the same school as groom.

979
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:57,135
By the way, you've got
quite a taste for man.

980
01:13:57,246 --> 01:14:00,579
- What?
- Keep walking.

981
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:01,848
Gosh.

982
01:14:03,186 --> 01:14:05,347
You shouldn't believe what he said!

983
01:14:10,827 --> 01:14:13,489
I've been quite a jerk so far.

984
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:16,894
Things have not been smooth
between us from the beginning.

985
01:14:18,768 --> 01:14:20,702
But you were pretty charming today.

986
01:14:29,045 --> 01:14:30,103
What?

987
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:31,335
It's me.

988
01:14:31,481 --> 01:14:34,314
I'm coming to Korea with your dad.
Meet us tomorrow.

989
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,643
Anyway, see you tomorrow at dinner.

990
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:38,151
Mom, wait!

991
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:43,625
What's wrong?

992
01:14:45,962 --> 01:14:47,953
My dad is coming to Korea.

993
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:54,999
Have you dreamed of being a doctor
since you were little?

994
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:56,505
No.

995
01:14:57,773 --> 01:15:00,264
I wanted to be a doctor
since as far as I remember.

996
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:04,610
Is it fun living as urologist?

997
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:09,016
Female urologist...
Doesn't it sound intense already?

998
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:11,412
All these prejudice and contempt...

999
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,821
But there's no one with no wound.

1000
01:15:16,259 --> 01:15:17,692
You mean like a trauma?

1001
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,424
How is it going with
the girl at #602?

1002
01:15:26,536 --> 01:15:27,503
What?

1003
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:31,138
Be nice to her.
You two make a good couple.

1004
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:38,174
Fuck good couple.

1005
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:49,920
It must be fireworks festival!

1006
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:52,559
Indeed.

1007
01:16:01,404 --> 01:16:04,168
Excuse me, but
we have to close now.

1008
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:09,609
Alright.

1009
01:16:10,313 --> 01:16:12,838
Shall we go?

1010
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,108
Yes.

1011
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:16,711
Your purse...

1012
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:22,354
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

1013
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:25,317
Are you okay?

1014
01:16:25,528 --> 01:16:27,120
- I'm fine.
- Let me see.

1015
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:28,654
See what?

1016
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:31,199
I'm the urologist,
give me some credit!

1017
01:16:31,234 --> 01:16:32,360
I just need a moment.

1018
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:35,369
Let me see...holy cow!
What shall I do?

1019
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:37,998
Are you crazy? Don't!

1020
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:40,667
I just need a minute!

1021
01:16:43,112 --> 01:16:45,546
What an embarrassment!

1022
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:54,856
It does feel good.

1023
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:16,643
Where's dad?

1024
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,704
He really wanted to come
together this time,

1025
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:21,951
but something important
came up in the States.

1026
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:23,543
Aren't you fed up with all this?

1027
01:17:24,854 --> 01:17:27,152
He's all about working,
never caring about his family!

1028
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,725
Or the money compensates all?

1029
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,955
Can you forgive the husband
who has never cared about you?

1030
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,832
Don't make a scene.
Are you crazy?

1031
01:17:40,903 --> 01:17:42,336
Crazy? Hell yes I am.

1032
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:45,930
I'm crazy because of the way
people look at the female urologist,

1033
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:49,408
and because my dad never loved me
since I was not born as boy.

1034
01:17:51,847 --> 01:17:54,315
Don't you know why I chose
the urology as my specialty?

1035
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:59,011
You really don't know why
I worked my ass off to be urologist!

1036
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:01,924
Just to be loved
by my almighty father!

1037
01:18:01,924 --> 01:18:03,016
Do you get it now?

1038
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:19,872
CALLER ID: SUNG-GI

1039
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:27,248
GIL SHIN-SEOL / UROLOGY
FAILED

1040
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:31,981
What happened?

1041
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,255
It's the professor's decision.

1042
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:37,621
I was the best intern and
I passed all the tests.

1043
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,920
Why did he fail me?

1044
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:44,393
I heard you failed me
because I chose the urology.

1045
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,499
Why did you do that?
Because I'm a girl?

1046
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:49,732
I'm not a girl,
I am a doctor.

1047
01:18:50,806 --> 01:18:55,402
You'd better watch out, sir.
I will definitely make the urologist.

1048
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:58,414
I will be a much better urologist
than you, father.

1049
01:18:58,414 --> 01:19:00,245
Keep your eyes wide open, understand?

1050
01:19:09,091 --> 01:19:10,080
Touche.

1051
01:19:11,594 --> 01:19:13,585
I chose ob/gyn to make money.

1052
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:15,824
He didn't show up today either.

1053
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:20,363
I almost forget how he looks like.

1054
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:24,705
Listen, Dr. Gil.
Your father didn't get in your way.

1055
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:26,832
He must have worried
about you a lot.

1056
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:31,446
How could he have done that
if he was worried about me?

1057
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:34,545
But eventually

1058
01:19:34,617 --> 01:19:37,177
he will give you credit
for who you are.

1059
01:19:38,154 --> 01:19:39,712
Shall we order another dish?

1060
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:42,923
Something not spicy...

1061
01:19:49,932 --> 01:19:57,168
Don't you have any
traumatic experiences as a doctor?

1062
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,239
Nothing special.

1063
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:03,006
Don't be like that!
I told you everything!

1064
01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:04,644
Did you?

1065
01:20:13,722 --> 01:20:15,155
How about...

1066
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,120
Cheers!

1067
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,397
I heard a lot about you, Sung-gi.

1068
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:27,024
It's finally good to meet you.

1069
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:31,867
The sauce is made of Thai chilli.

1070
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:34,301
- Try it, it's really good.
- It's alright.

1071
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:35,410
Please.

1072
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:42,111
You should try it, ma'am.

1073
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:46,885
I'm allergic to the spicy food.

1074
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:49,719
Made in heaven of two
not putting up with the spicy?

1075
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:53,359
I have a question.

1076
01:20:53,596 --> 01:20:56,531
What do you think of
dating a doctor?

1077
01:20:59,068 --> 01:21:01,969
It won't do harm
as we have same profession.

1078
01:21:02,338 --> 01:21:06,172
- And what if he's a doctor with flaw?
- What kind of flaw?

1079
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:08,571
Well...

1080
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:12,313
- How about...
- Let's change the subject.

1081
01:21:14,383 --> 01:21:17,113
Either for marriage or
for just a relationship...

1082
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:19,051
love is important but

1083
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:21,122
sex is equally is important, isn't it?

1084
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:22,121
Sure, it is.

1085
01:21:23,192 --> 01:21:24,181
That's right.

1086
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:29,663
But what if the man is impotent?
Can you go out with him?

1087
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:35,334
Well...I'll have to think about that.

1088
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:38,999
You're not dating a guy
only in a platonic way.

1089
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:42,970
And impotence is curable
if the cause is renovascular.

1090
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:45,343
But most of cases,
it is psychological.

1091
01:21:45,548 --> 01:21:47,539
And it makes it very difficult
to be cured.

1092
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:52,576
I will have to pray desperately
if he were not mine.

1093
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:58,152
And concealing impotence
between a couple is wrong, right?

1094
01:21:58,193 --> 01:22:01,162
Sure, it can be a ground for divorce.

1095
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,393
Did you know it then?

1096
01:22:05,501 --> 01:22:06,968
That he's impotent.

1097
01:22:20,249 --> 01:22:23,343
Sung-gi! Wait!

1098
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:25,979
Sung-gi!

1099
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:31,492
I am sorry.

1100
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:39,527
I truly am. I didn't know.

1101
01:22:41,937 --> 01:22:46,374
Are you telling the same shit
to your own patients?

1102
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:49,236
I didn't mean any harm saying that.

1103
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:53,973
I know you're a real catch.

1104
01:22:55,451 --> 01:22:58,113
And I do have feelings for you.

1105
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,080
So please don't be so mad.

1106
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:03,051
Please?

1107
01:23:09,098 --> 01:23:11,430
The night when you were drunk
and spent together.

1108
01:23:11,834 --> 01:23:14,997
I didn't do you simply because
I couldn't get it up, you see?

1109
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,436
There's no reason for you
to have feelings for me now.

1110
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:19,433
What did you say?

1111
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:23,204
I didn't want to protect you,
I just couldn't get it up!

1112
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:25,266
What's wrong with you, Doctor Gil!

1113
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:26,704
Please wake up!

1114
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:35,213
Are you okay?

1115
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:42,847
Didn't you know
she's allergic to capsaicin?

1116
01:24:43,225 --> 01:24:47,525
And you did CPR to her?
Are you insane?

1117
01:24:52,668 --> 01:24:54,260
How the hell could I know?

1118
01:24:59,675 --> 01:25:01,233
What are you doing?

1119
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:02,668
I am fine now.

1120
01:25:02,878 --> 01:25:04,505
Stay in bed a bit longer.

1121
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:09,317
I am a doctor.
I know about my conditions.

1122
01:25:09,451 --> 01:25:11,214
I didn't say you wouldn't know.

1123
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,283
I just said to take rest.

1124
01:25:13,388 --> 01:25:15,117
Why are you doing this to me?

1125
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:22,788
I didn't do you because
I couldn't get it up!

1126
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:24,092
I didn't protect you.

1127
01:26:05,607 --> 01:26:08,007
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
FOR PERSONAL REASONS

1128
01:26:50,152 --> 01:26:52,620
I thought you were in
a deadly condition

1129
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:54,083
to close the clinic.

1130
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:55,850
What brought you here?

1131
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:57,414
You heartless thing.

1132
01:26:57,526 --> 01:26:59,858
Does a mom need a reason
to come to her daughter's?

1133
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:02,763
Turn the TV on.

1134
01:27:02,865 --> 01:27:05,527
Today we have Doctor
Gil Joon-won

1135
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:07,831
who won the best scholarship award

1136
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:09,996
at the World Urology Academy.

1137
01:27:10,072 --> 01:27:14,702
He became the winner
for his achievement

1138
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:18,302
in innovating the laparoscope operation.

1139
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,940
Congratulations again, doctor.

1140
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,047
You're the first Korean
to receive this award.

1141
01:27:23,185 --> 01:27:24,516
Yes, thank you.

1142
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,844
I am most pleased that

1143
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:33,191
I could complete the research
that my late father had begun.

1144
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:35,526
I heard that

1145
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,760
it took 15 long years
to complete this study.

1146
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:41,735
But you won't stop here.
What's your next project?

1147
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,664
I will get my new research begun.

1148
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:51,541
If I got too old
before I could finish this study,

1149
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,111
my daughter might inherit it
and would finish it.

1150
01:27:55,183 --> 01:27:57,549
That is what I sincerely wish.

1151
01:27:57,719 --> 01:27:59,914
If your daughter is the urologist,

1152
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:02,855
you're a urologist family
for three generations.

1153
01:28:03,592 --> 01:28:05,025
That is right.

1154
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,160
When she first told me
to become the urologist,

1155
01:28:09,698 --> 01:28:14,101
I was worried if she gets hurt
by the prejudices of others.

1156
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:17,495
But it now seems that
she has made an excellent doctor.

1157
01:28:17,572 --> 01:28:20,166
Congratulations again for winning.

1158
01:28:20,275 --> 01:28:22,607
And thank you for your time today.

1159
01:28:24,212 --> 01:28:25,839
Next news...

1160
01:28:26,648 --> 01:28:30,982
The world ratings agency,
Moody's announced today...

1161
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:34,778
You came to show me this?

1162
01:28:35,223 --> 01:28:39,421
I hope you will have a daughter
exactly like you.

1163
01:28:39,494 --> 01:28:41,792
Then you'll understand
what is to be parents.

1164
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:43,557
I'd get going.

1165
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,665
Stay. I will make you dinner.

1166
01:28:55,877 --> 01:29:00,712
91 1? There's a car accident
and the driver is expecting mother.

1167
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:03,116
It's emergency.

1168
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:04,777
Please hurry.

1169
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,849
Are you okay?

1170
01:29:11,593 --> 01:29:13,083
Hello, open your eyes!

1171
01:29:13,528 --> 01:29:14,790
Can you hear me?

1172
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:18,858
Wake up!

1173
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:21,293
Damn...

1174
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:24,999
The waters already broke!
The baby is soon coming.

1175
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:27,402
Anyone...

1176
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:29,975
Please help her, doctor.

1177
01:29:30,145 --> 01:29:32,113
You will be alright,
the doctor's here.

1178
01:29:32,214 --> 01:29:33,146
Please hold.

1179
01:29:33,548 --> 01:29:35,846
What are you doing?
I said to help us!

1180
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,422
- Please hold a bit!
- Looks like it's coming out!

1181
01:29:51,566 --> 01:29:52,430
Is it?

1182
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:55,194
What are you doing?

1183
01:29:58,373 --> 01:30:00,898
- You're an obstetrician!
- I can't deliver!

1184
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,107
I already see the head!

1185
01:30:06,515 --> 01:30:07,482
I will do that.

1186
01:30:07,549 --> 01:30:09,847
- Check on the mother, please.
- Yes.

1187
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:19,620
Come here and help, please!

1188
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:23,797
The pulse is falling.

1189
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,401
We will have to do
the cesarean operation.

1190
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:29,029
It's too risky.
She can go into shock.

1191
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,098
We could lose both
if we don't get the timing right.

1192
01:30:33,108 --> 01:30:34,473
Give her the injection
for induced labor.

1193
01:30:34,543 --> 01:30:35,373
Doctor!

1194
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:45,014
Check out the contractions.

1195
01:30:45,754 --> 01:30:47,244
It stopped now.

1196
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:51,589
Ma'am, please don't lose it.

1197
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:54,893
You should wake up!

1198
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:56,893
Stay with me!

1199
01:30:57,232 --> 01:30:59,792
Please take two deep breaths.

1200
01:31:03,138 --> 01:31:06,335
Exhale deeply and slowly...
Then push!

1201
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,050
FETAL DEATH AT 23:26

1202
01:31:36,638 --> 01:31:38,868
How did it go?
Are they both okay?

1203
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:40,296
Yes.

1204
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:45,146
- It is a boy.
- What?

1205
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:47,776
Why don't you see him yourself?

1206
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:56,884
Thank you so much for help.

1207
01:31:57,159 --> 01:31:58,751
Don't mention it.

1208
01:32:06,168 --> 01:32:10,036
The baby we had together
is a healthy boy.

1209
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,633
What have you lost?

1210
01:33:23,878 --> 01:33:26,711
- You really have to go now?
- I am a busy person, too.

1211
01:33:56,745 --> 01:33:57,871
Shin-seol!

1212
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:01,705
Open the door.
I know you're in there.

1213
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:03,377
Shin-seol!

1214
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:06,142
Shin-seol!

1215
01:34:20,902 --> 01:34:23,666
- You think I left in your house?
- It must be there.

1216
01:34:31,913 --> 01:34:32,937
Found it!

1217
01:34:33,148 --> 01:34:35,241
I forget things too much lately.

1218
01:34:38,687 --> 01:34:40,382
Look, Shin-seol,

1219
01:34:40,955 --> 01:34:42,718
I know you're in there!

1220
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:44,457
Listen...

1221
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:51,296
I have thought about it a lot.

1222
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:58,168
And it seems like I love you.

1223
01:34:58,807 --> 01:35:00,570
Me, Wang Sung-gi

1224
01:35:01,309 --> 01:35:03,072
loves you, Gil Sin-seol.

1225
01:35:04,179 --> 01:35:06,340
But you know what?

1226
01:35:07,349 --> 01:35:09,317
There's another thing

1227
01:35:10,685 --> 01:35:13,381
I couldn't tell you
as I felt a bit ashamed.

1228
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:19,890
- I am the Roly Poly, in fact.
- Roly Poly?

1229
01:35:20,328 --> 01:35:24,162
You know what I mean.
I am that Roly Poly.

1230
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:26,764
You do listen to me, right?

1231
01:35:31,306 --> 01:35:32,671
You see...

1232
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:36,234
My heart here is beating, Sin-seol.

1233
01:35:37,345 --> 01:35:39,472
You make my heart beat so bad.

1234
01:35:42,283 --> 01:35:45,878
And I couldn't get it up,
not once for 7 years.

1235
01:35:47,589 --> 01:35:51,184
But the night
we spent together,

1236
01:35:51,526 --> 01:35:55,656
it got up real hard.

1237
01:35:56,664 --> 01:36:00,498
I'm telling the truth!
You got mine up!

1238
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:03,631
To get him the first erection
in 7 years? Impressive!

1239
01:36:03,872 --> 01:36:07,706
It's not like that.
He must be crazy.

1240
01:36:16,217 --> 01:36:18,481
I will wrap up
real soon, please.

1241
01:36:18,686 --> 01:36:20,813
What's wrong with you?
Stop it.

1242
01:36:20,922 --> 01:36:22,253
Give me that.

1243
01:36:22,757 --> 01:36:24,349
And go back inside!

1244
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:26,320
You know what?

1245
01:36:29,864 --> 01:36:35,632
The chilli power was not
originally from Korea.

1246
01:36:36,037 --> 01:36:37,732
So there's nothing wrong

1247
01:36:37,772 --> 01:36:40,138
about a Korean
who cannot eat spicy food.

1248
01:36:40,241 --> 01:36:42,869
In fact, I don't like it either.
I hate spicy food.

1249
01:36:42,944 --> 01:36:44,138
I will never eat it.

1250
01:36:45,447 --> 01:36:47,847
What are you doing?
So embarrassing.

1251
01:36:48,817 --> 01:36:50,717
What's so proud about
not being able to get it up!

1252
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:53,014
I got it up, I told you!

1253
01:36:53,254 --> 01:36:57,816
At the night we spent together.

1254
01:36:58,293 --> 01:37:00,318
Ease your temper a bit.

1255
01:37:00,762 --> 01:37:01,854
Hold on.

1256
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:16,843
How do you like me?

1257
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,242
If you don't dislike me too much,
how about going out with me?

1258
01:37:22,851 --> 01:37:25,115
No, you should go out with me.

1259
01:37:27,388 --> 01:37:28,616
Answer me!

1260
01:37:56,985 --> 01:37:59,146
- Hold on, wait.
- Now what?

1261
01:37:59,787 --> 01:38:01,049
Wait...

1262
01:38:01,489 --> 01:38:02,956
It's alright.

1263
01:38:03,057 --> 01:38:05,048
I haven't eaten it since.

1264
01:38:06,494 --> 01:38:08,860
I haven't eaten that
quite a while!

1265
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:12,388
So please...
I don't want to go to hospital!

1266
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:15,094
It's all clear, I said.
So please open your mouth!

1267
01:38:15,169 --> 01:38:19,538
Wait, there are eyes watching.
How about going inside?

1268
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,507
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1269
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:26,580
I'm late, let's go.

1270
01:38:27,415 --> 01:38:29,417
Let me help you with the tie.

1271
01:38:29,417 --> 01:38:31,044
- Good.
- Let's go! We're already late.

1272
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:34,019
What?

1273
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:40,725
I am really late!

1274
01:38:58,179 --> 01:39:00,010
Didn't you lie about impotence?

1275
01:39:31,312 --> 01:39:36,409
I don't envy the princess
who met her prince charming anymore.

1276
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:43,218
I've met my own prince charming.
Our love is sweeter than ever.

1277
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:53,431
And on top of that...

1278
01:39:56,137 --> 01:40:00,836
this fabulous man
gets it up only for me!

1279
01:40:23,564 --> 01:40:24,826
Damn.

1280
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:36,241
Oh my god!
I am so sorry.

1281
01:40:37,645 --> 01:40:38,942
Are you okay?

1282
01:40:39,147 --> 01:40:42,207
It doesn't look so bad.

1283
01:41:55,923 --> 01:42:00,758
- It hurts like hell, you bastard!
- Why are you cursing at me?

1284
01:42:01,162 --> 01:42:02,993
- Three, two, one!
- One more time!

1285
01:42:09,704 --> 01:42:11,865
I thought you'd miss this, too.

1286
01:42:12,273 --> 01:42:13,240
Father!

1287
01:42:13,407 --> 01:42:16,274
- I see the head, doctor!
- Head, right, head!

1288
01:42:16,377 --> 01:42:17,366
It's coming out!

1289
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:19,002
Push one more time.

1290
01:42:19,447 --> 01:42:20,345
Three

1291
01:42:20,448 --> 01:42:21,972
Two... One!

1292
01:42:24,786 --> 01:42:25,753
One last time!

1293
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:28,448
Three, Two... One!

1294
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,551
Honey, there she is.
It's princess!

1295
01:42:35,663 --> 01:42:38,188
Honey, I made it!
