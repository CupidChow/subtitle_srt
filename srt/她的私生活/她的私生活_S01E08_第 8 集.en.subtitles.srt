1
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,906
There you go.

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,202
-Thank you.
-This was my fault anyway.

3
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,956
Come to think of it,

4
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,791
this feels unfair.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,710
What is?

6
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,004
You saw my whole house.

7
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,131
But why can't I see yours?

8
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,886
To make things fair, I'll look too.

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,637
No!

10
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,980
Do you want me?

11
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,032
Ms. Sung?

12
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,079
Ms. Sung?

13
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,420
Director Gold, you should go home now.

14
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,714
The exit is over there.

15
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,094
Ms. Sung.

16
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,263
Ms. Sung?

17
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,474
-I...
-Oh, right.

18
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,893
This way.

19
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,102
Be careful.

20
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,314
You should go. Come this way.

21
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,860
This way. Watch the doorsill.

22
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,113
It's this way.

23
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,908
You're all good now.

24
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,167
I'm sorry. It must've been
really uncomfortable.

25
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,714
If you're sorry, you should
invite me over next time

26
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,007
after you clean your place.

27
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,759
I don't think...

28
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,594
Okay.

29
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,180
But

30
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,266
is there something wrong?

31
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,477
You didn't seem so well earlier.

32
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,397
It seemed like you had a lot on your mind

33
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,148
judging by the way you were painting.

34
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,620
I edited your photo.

35
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,955
Is...

36
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,249
something bothering you?

37
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,042
You.

38
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,006
-No.
-Then,

39
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,341
are you sick?

40
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,135
It's because of you.

41
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,932
-No.
-Let me know

42
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,018
if there's anything I can do to help.

43
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,313
Anything?

44
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,611
The thing is, Director Gold...

45
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,405
Yes, Ms. Sung?

46
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,784
To be honest, I...

47
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,038
I LOVE SI-AN

48
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,293
My gosh.

49
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,254
-Ms. Sung.
-There's paint on the ground.

50
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,256
-What?
-I'm okay.

51
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,924
Aren't you tired?

52
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,885
I'm so exhausted all of a sudden.

53
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,136
You should get going.

54
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,929
-We both have work tomorrow.
-Right.

55
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,182
-It's this way down the stairs.
-Okay.

56
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,475
Bye.

57
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,886
I held it in well.

58
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,056
I held it in very well.

59
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,451
Why did I hold back?
I should've just done it.

60
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,912
-Do what?
-Kiss.

61
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,998
-With whom?
-Lion.

62
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,708
You want to kiss Lion?

63
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,003
No.

64
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,296
Don't lie to me.

65
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,132
You look really sad right now.

66
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,716
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

67
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,301
-You like him, don't you?
-No.

68
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,179
-Yes, you do.
-No, I don't. I should go.

69
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,848
Wait. Sit back down.

70
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,851
Where did you go
after the signing event yesterday?

71
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,437
-I was busy editing the photos.
-Then why didn't you upload any?

72
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,285
To be honest,

73
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,955
I edited photos of Lion.

74
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,209
You must really like him.

75
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,712
I can't seem to stop myself
from speaking my mind.

76
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,797
Yesterday, I almost even confessed
my feelings for him.

77
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,300
-Hey, don't ever do that.
-Why not?

78
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,094
It's natural for you to like him.

79
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,848
He's good-looking, competent,
and kind to you.

80
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,268
But does he like you, too?

81
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,813
He suddenly came over to me

82
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,191
like this and kissed me

83
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,110
-like this.
-You said Sindy was watching.

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,946
If he likes you, he would've
kissed you on the lips,

85
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,531
not his finger.

86
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,116
He knows better than that.

87
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,329
When he went over to my house,
he was really kind to my parents.

88
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,663
You know he rarely smiles, right?

89
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,373
He also ate really well.

90
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,334
He couldn't have complained
about the food, you know.

91
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,543
Confessing your love for someone

92
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,670
isn't just about having courage.

93
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,340
First, you need to be sure that
you have mutual feelings for each other.

94
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,466
Confessing how you feel

95
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,052
is only a matter
of mutually confirming that.

96
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,721
I don't think he hates me.

97
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,974
Yes, but that doesn't exactly mean
he's head over heels for you.

98
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,768
Let me make one thing clear.

99
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,355
He only volunteered to help you
out of his love for humanity.

100
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,400
He's been helping you deal with
both the scandal and Sindy.

101
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,818
What would happen if he rejects you?

102
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,071
Why are you being so pessimistic?
You were never like this.

103
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,907
I'm not being pessimistic.
I'm being realistic.

104
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,201
Are you okay with getting rejected?

105
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,328
You'll have to see him every day
at the gallery.

106
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,748
So you need to wait

107
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,084
until you're sure of how he feels.

108
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,562
Hyo-jin.

109
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,066
Is this the art museum? Why are you here?

110
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,027
Why are you at the building
where Cha Si-an lives?

111
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,198
Really? I didn't know
Cha Si-an lived here.

112
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,993
Hyo-jin.

113
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,121
Give me your car keys and credit card.

114
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,123
-What?
-Bring them to me.

115
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,042
Come here.

116
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,045
Mom, that's...

117
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,006
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am.

118
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,382
Catch her.

119
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,302
Just a second.

120
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,561
I'll take your car keys.

121
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,895
Where's the credit card?

122
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,691
Mom, if you take them both,
how am I supposed to live?

123
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,359
Why do you even need a credit card?

124
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,445
I'm sure you feel full

125
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,906
and extremely happy just by
looking at Cha Si-an's face.

126
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,783
Mom, it's a misunderstanding.

127
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,160
Where's the credit card?

128
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,457
Director Gold!

129
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,083
Director Gold!

130
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,307
HOW WOULD THIS PERSON REACT IF YOU
CONFESSED YOUR FEELINGS TO THEM?

131
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,897
NAME: RYAN GOLD

132
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,193
"YOU'RE NOT JUST AFTER MY BODY, ARE YOU?"
TRY AGAIN

133
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,530
You're not

134
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,326
just after my body, are you?

135
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,286
What? No way.

136
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,217
NAME: LION

137
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,218
"GET LOST!"

138
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,348
Get lost.

139
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,768
Why would you say that to me?

140
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,520
You're so mean.

141
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,939
You get lost.

142
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,150
I've had it with you, too.

143
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,528
Ms. Sung.

144
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,988
What is it?

145
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,491
Are you busy?

146
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,661
Not at all. Do you have a job for me?

147
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,335
It's not business-related.

148
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,672
-Then what?
-There's something

149
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,465
you'd be happy to hear.

150
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,759
Something I'd be happy to hear?

151
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,555
What is it?

152
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,265
Actually, I...

153
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,017
Director Gold, here you are.

154
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,521
The official paper for Ullim Art Gallery
is on your desk.

155
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,772
All right.

156
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,944
Can we...

157
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,326
Why is he acting all shy?

158
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,914
Is he going to ask me out?

159
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,632
Wait, this place...

160
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,452
Director Gold,

161
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,705
you can go ahead and tell me.

162
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,167
I see that you're unaware of it.

163
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,085
How can I know when you haven't told me?

164
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,048
I thought you were always seeing
it for yourself.

165
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,884
Yes, I'm always seeing it for myself,

166
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,095
but I'd appreciate
you telling me yourself.

167
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,726
Well, just so you know,

168
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,645
I...

169
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,522
Yes?

170
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,904
I had CUPATCH deleted.

171
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,617
Director Gold lives here, too.
He's the one I'm here to see.

172
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,039
Mr. Gold, is Hyo-jin telling the truth?

173
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,293
-Regarding what?
-Mr. Gold, I hoped

174
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,213
that working at the museum
would help Hyo-jin

175
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,675
appreciate elegant artwork
and become as sophisticated as me.

176
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,719
However, because you invited Cha Si-an

177
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,306
to participate
in Cheum's special exhibition,

178
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,184
I am now more worried than I am excited.

179
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,187
She left for work early today,

180
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,689
so I tailed her.

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,193
I followed her out of concern,

182
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,571
but she came straight here
where Cha Si-an lives.

183
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,489
According to Hyo-jin though,

184
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,950
she's only here
because you asked her to come.

185
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,118
Is that true?

186
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,289
Ms. Eom.

187
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,543
Didn't I tell you to stay out
of the museum's business

188
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,503
and the lives of its employees?

189
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,172
But she's my daughter.

190
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,217
Right now, she's my employee.

191
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,720
We'll talk about the rest at the museum.

192
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,097
Bye, then.

193
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,646
Mom, I'm off to work, then.

194
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,191
Mr. Kim, what's your take on this?

195
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,777
Oh, right. Well...

196
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,112
What do you think?

197
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,365
Sorry?

198
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,951
Hyo-jin won't follow us around anymore.

199
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,161
Isn't that great?

200
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,081
Yes, it is.

201
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,791
I knew you'd be glad.

202
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,211
Also, Hyo-jin will probably
quit the museum soon.

203
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,838
Let's just hang in there until then.

204
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,229
Between the leaves.

205
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,025
-What are these for?
-The fanpage.

206
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,110
This is great.

207
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,112
I captured that dreamy vibe.

208
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,739
Now, stand over here.

209
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,702
Hold up your fingers
and look through them.

210
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,374
Good.

211
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,377
Ms. Lee, aren't we opening
the coffee shop today?

212
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,879
Business isn't the problem right now.

213
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,548
You not having a fanpage is the problem.

214
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,717
Why do I need one
when I don't have any fans?

215
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,178
You have to open a coffee shop
for people to come drink coffee.

216
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,389
And you need to make a fanpage
to gather fans.

217
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,808
Ms. Lee, your friend seems a little off.

218
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,316
Duk-mi, what's wrong?

219
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,946
Don't tell me you asked him out
and he rejected you.

220
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,823
-No.
-Then what?

221
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,033
Was something new posted on CUPATCH?

222
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,162
-CUPATCH has been deleted.
-Deleted?

223
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,709
CUPATCH

224
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,918
You're not kidding.

225
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,255
Sindy must really believe you two, then.

226
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,216
It's great news, so why do you seem glum?

227
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,137
Lion said we should
just hang in there until she quits.

228
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,304
What do you think that means?

229
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,140
Well...

230
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,102
It'd be weird if you break up
right after CUPATCH is gone,

231
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,105
so he's suggesting that you guys
should wait until she quits and--

232
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,232
That's what it means, right?

233
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,943
He's saying that
the fake relationship is a nuisance.

234
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,280
So Sindy must quit for him to finally end

235
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,241
-this annoying fake relationship.
-You're being too negative.

236
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,203
Seon-ju, I feel like
I'm on a roller coaster ride.

237
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,873
My mood keeps going up and down.
I'm like a madwoman.

238
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,125
Do you want to keep pretending
that you're dating?

239
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,298
Then Sindy should keep working
at the museum.

240
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,091
How do I make that happen?

241
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,804
That's something you should work on.

242
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,769
We've officially asked Ullim Art Gallery

243
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,062
to lend us the artwork of Mr. Ahn.

244
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,730
You have a meeting with them
this afternoon.

245
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,026
We need to store his pieces
for his New York exhibition as well.

246
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,069
Will that be possible?

247
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,155
We don't have enough room, so we're
looking for a storage facility off-site.

248
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,074
I'll put together a list.

249
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,325
All right.

250
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,708
I can't help it. I'm bored.

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,168
Give me something to do, then.

252
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,379
Hyo-jin, I asked you to sort out our files

253
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,756
about a week ago.

254
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,882
Oh, that.

255
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,426
Well, that task is extremely boring.

256
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,179
It violates my human rights.

257
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,850
Can I be a part
of the special exhibition, too?

258
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,895
I'd work incredibly hard to help Si-an.

259
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,522
I'm worried that you'd go too far.

260
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,148
But Director Gold...

261
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,193
Why don't we give her a chance?

262
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,241
How about product planning?

263
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,867
Product planning?

264
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,745
The so-called merchandise.

265
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,288
Exhibition souvenirs.

266
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,417
Pencils and postcards
are all that museums sell as merchandise.

267
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,336
It sounds boring.

268
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,172
How about something related to Si-an?

269
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,967
We need merchandise
for the special exhibition, too.

270
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,094
I'll do that!

271
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,055
Responsibility or diligence.

272
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,559
You haven't shown either one,
so why must I trust you on this?

273
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,770
I'll use this opportunity to show you.

274
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,982
Certain jobs can change people.

275
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,034
Internal documents and meeting contents

276
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,203
must not be mentioned or leaked
outside this museum.

277
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,413
Of course.

278
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,424
Who was in charge of
the merchandise so far?

279
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,634
Ms. Sung and I were in charge.

280
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,303
That's why they were awful.

281
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,771
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes?

282
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,231
Are you free this afternoon?

283
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,860
-Yes.
-Then come with me somewhere.

284
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,529
-Where?
-You'll see.

285
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,116
Meet me in the parking lot in 30 minutes.

286
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,916
Make yourself look nice.

287
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,235
A meeting with Cha Si-an?

288
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,655
Cha Si-an had some urgent business
yesterday, so I couldn't meet him.

289
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,617
But why did you ask me to look nice?

290
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,829
When he visited last time,

291
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,622
everyone seemed concerned
about their looks.

292
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,166
Ms. Yu and Hyo-jin as well.

293
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,543
Everybody.

294
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,712
Oh, I thought...

295
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,548
What?

296
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,425
You thought what?

297
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,218
It's nothing.

298
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,148
One.

299
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,400
Get up.

300
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,777
Get up quickly.

301
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,362
Two.

302
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,835
-Hello.
-Hello.

303
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,421
Yes, hello, kids.

304
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,049
You're so cute.

305
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,092
All right, look forward.

306
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,178
Don't get distracted during training.

307
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,429
One!

308
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,557
Get up.

309
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,225
Two.

310
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,813
Get up quickly. Come on.

311
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,107
Hey, careful!

312
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,859
Kids!

313
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,944
You'll catch a cold. Stop it!

314
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,998
I'm all wet.

315
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,208
Get back up.

316
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,543
Two.

317
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,049
Let's see who gets up faster. Get up.

318
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,342
One!

319
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,887
Two.

320
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,682
Get up more quickly.

321
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,020
Two.

322
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,277
-Mom.
-Yes.

323
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,829
When did that get on my face?

324
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,839
I'm fine, don't worry.

325
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,382
Here.

326
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,801
Let's eat.

327
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,554
-This looks delicious.
-Eun-gi.

328
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,305
Are you upset with me about something?

329
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,557
Upset?

330
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,143
Why would a son be upset with his mom?

331
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,478
Then why aren't you
coming home these days?

332
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,398
You've been skipping meals
and you look so thin.

333
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,070
If I eat tasty food like this
all the time, I'd look like a pig.

334
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,364
Gosh, you and your mouth.

335
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,577
Mom, let's eat meat for dinner.
It's my treat.

336
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,496
Tell Duk-mi to come home, too.

337
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,332
Tell her she must come home
tonight for dinner.

338
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,417
Okay?

339
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,795
This is yummy.

340
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,842
You can't get a hold
of the visual director?

341
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,888
I thought the director was a decent
person, but I guess you never know.

342
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,932
So considering the circumstances,

343
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,060
-I'm afraid the exhibition will--
-Don't tell me

344
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,730
that you're saying you can't
participate in the exhibition.

345
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,106
I'm sorry, Director Gold.

346
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,858
But I can't participate in the exhibition

347
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,651
while postponing the release of
my single album.

348
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,112
And you shouldn't postpone
the exhibition because of me.

349
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,238
What about another director?

350
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,990
We're looking into it

351
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,076
but it's hard to find a suitable director.

352
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,332
Do you know

353
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,501
a woman named Choi Da-in?

354
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,794
Of course, I do.

355
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,756
I wanted to work with her
and called her several times.

356
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,968
If Ms. Choi agrees on being
your visual director,

357
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,763
will you be able to continue with
the exhibition and your album?

358
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,806
Of course.

359
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,309
Are you acquainted with Ms. Choi?

360
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,228
I know her well.

361
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,898
I'm Choi Da-in.

362
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,903
I missed you, Ryan.

363
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,822
It would be great if you could do that.

364
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,242
Please put in a good word for us.

365
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,786
I will contact Ms. Choi.

366
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,870
Okay.

367
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,169
I guess there will be no trouble
with the exhibition.

368
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,340
Isn't Ms. Choi the woman
who came by the museum last time?

369
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,592
Right. You've met her, too.

370
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,511
She's very talented.

371
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,639
Her participation in this exhibition
will help promote it as well.

372
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,976
But will she accept the job?
It's a very tight schedule.

373
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,604
-She will.
-You sound very confident.

374
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,191
I haven't asked her for a favor
in ten years.

375
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,777
She'll do it if she has a conscience.

376
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,862
Ten years?

377
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,574
I had a favor to ask her anyway
regarding the special exhibition.

378
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,203
She has the last picture of
the late Yun Tae-hwa.

379
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,956
If she's the owner of that picture,
is she "Many Peaple"?

380
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,916
Her name means "many people."

381
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,295
It's an ID I made for her
when I first met her.

382
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,922
I didn't know she'd still be using it.

383
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,138
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes?

384
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,764
Are you free today?

385
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,475
I thought I'd go straight home,
and made dinner plans with my mom.

386
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,352
-I can cancel it.
-No.

387
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,354
It's not urgent. Get in.

388
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,038
I made a reservation at seven o'clock
under the name Ryan Gold.

389
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,042
I'm sorry, but I'd like to
cancel the reservation.

390
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,044
Okay.

391
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,934
Drive carefully.

392
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,855
What about the interview
with Moment tomorrow?

393
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,274
You can go ahead and fix
a time for the interview.

394
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,567
Okay.

395
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,403
I'm planning on going straight to
Ms. Choi's studio tomorrow.

396
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,781
Will you come with me?

397
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,450
Yes.

398
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,285
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

399
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,571
Mr. Nam Eun-gi?

400
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,325
Until when will you
keep pretending to date?

401
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,744
Since that CUPATCH or whatever
is gone and all,

402
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,663
why don't you stop with the acting now?

403
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,417
That's up to us to decide. It's not--

404
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,584
"Us"?

405
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,214
Are you interested in Duk-mi?

406
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,011
I don't think
that's your business either...

407
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,847
It is my business.

408
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,015
Don't change the subject and answer me.

409
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,934
Are you interested in Duk-mi?

410
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,520
Yes.

411
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,150
I think Ms. Sung is a decent person.

412
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,028
Are you just interested in her
as a human being?

413
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:04,033
Just like when you thought Duk-mi
and Seon-ju were dating and helped out?

414
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,122
If not, what is it?

415
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,709
I don't think I need to answer that.

416
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,127
You better stop.

417
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,839
Don't make Duk-mi waver
with that petty interest you have in her.

418
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,342
Did Ms. Sung

419
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,178
really waver?

420
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,892
Let me tell you one more time.

421
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,603
This is up to Ms. Sung and me to decide.

422
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,355
We don't have to listen to
what you have to say.

423
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,319
How much do you know about Duk-mi?

424
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,239
There's nothing I don't know about her.

425
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,367
I know enough.

426
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,661
Even more than you think.

427
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,291
I doubt Duk-mi told you about herself.

428
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,922
Duk-mi tells me everything.

429
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,090
She doesn't hide anything from me.

430
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,761
Do you think she'll be able
to do the same with you?

431
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,572
It's cooked.

432
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,954
-Cut it out.
-"Cut it out."

433
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,789
Stop mocking me
before I punch all your teeth out.

434
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,290
My teeth are very precious.

435
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,625
-Hey!
-What?

436
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,001
Will you stop?

437
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,635
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

438
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,556
How is Director Gold doing?

439
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,560
Mom, don't be so interested in him.
There's nothing going on between us.

440
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,937
Then why did he drive you home?

441
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,356
I'm sure he did that
because he has feelings for--

442
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,483
Mom, do you even have a conscience?

443
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,901
Your daughter's crazy.

444
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,987
-You can't let her get married.
-"Crazy"?

445
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,365
Eun-gi, I really hope you end up
with someone like me.

446
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,909
Really? Then I hope you also end up
with a guy like me.

447
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,744
-Are you nuts?
-Hey.

448
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,956
Do you think
I raised both of you until now

449
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,917
so I could get a daughter-in-law
and a son-in-law like you guys?

450
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,420
It'd be better for you to
stay single forever!

451
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,716
Stop eating.

452
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,968
But I bought that.

453
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,928
What's wrong
with a daughter-in-law like me?

454
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,390
Right, Dad?

455
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,560
Dad, wouldn't you love to have
a son-in-law like me?

456
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,774
Darn it.

457
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,071
What's so bad about us?
Aren't we decent enough?

458
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,197
Exactly.

459
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,949
-Eat up.
-You, too.

460
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,576
You look a little weary today.

461
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,213
Eun-gi.

462
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,801
What do you think about me?

463
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,722
Don't think of me
as your childhood friend.

464
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,807
Let's say you just met me today.

465
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,770
What would you think of me?

466
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,065
-I'd think you're pretty.
-Right?

467
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,735
Then how would you feel if a woman like me

468
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,738
told you that she likes you?

469
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,616
-I'd love it.
-Really?

470
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,994
Yes, I'd date a woman like you
without even hesitating.

471
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,162
Really?

472
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,414
And then I'd ask you this.

473
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,625
"You like idol stars? At your age?

474
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,585
On top of that,
you're even a fanpage master?

475
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,921
What is that anyway? Do you
follow them around and take photos?

476
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,547
Have you been doing that all your life?

477
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,300
Does that mean I'll always come second?

478
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,136
I want you to choose.
Is it me or Cha Si-an?"

479
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,017
Hey, you could've just given me
a simple answer.

480
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,894
You didn't have to suddenly
make it seem so real.

481
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,024
Duk-mi.

482
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,860
Date a guy who you can tell honestly

483
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,238
that you're a fangirl for life.

484
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:14,117
Don't meet someone
that makes you want to hide it.

485
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,582
But then again, you won't be able
to find a lot of guys like that.

486
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,265
How much do you know about Duk-mi?

487
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,855
Duk-mi tells me everything.

488
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,648
She doesn't hide anything from me.

489
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,609
Do you think she'll be able
to do the same with you?

THE ROAD TO SI-AN

491
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,208
We even exchange comments on her fanpage.

I can't believe my dream
is to become that water bottle.

493
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,131
"Water bottle"?

494
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,718
Lord, I am committing a sin right now.

495
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,595
What sin?

496
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,013
Si-an, I'm sorry.

497
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,516
Sorry about what?

498
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,924

It's all because of that day.

I'm happy I saw you that day.

-Should we go inside?
-Yes.

511
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,980
Ms. Choi Da-in.

512
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,735
Hello, Ms. Choi.

513
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,363
Are you here to talk to me about work?

514
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,450
Have a seat.

515
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,578
Do you know White Ocean, the idol group?

516
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,121
Yes.

517
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,373
One of the members of that group
is Cha Si-an.

518
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,711
He once asked me if I could be
the visual director of his album.

519
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,338
But I turned it down. Why do you ask?

520
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,799
I'd like you to reconsider.

521
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,968
It'd be even better if you just did it.

522
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,428
Why are you asking me to do that?

523
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,931
Cha Si-an will be participating
in our museum's special exhibition.

524
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,599
And he wants to use the same theme

525
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,726
for both the exhibition
and his single album.

526
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,562
-But his visual director--
-Suddenly went MIA.

527
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,569
Cha Si-an really wants to work with you.

528
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,657
And Cheum Museum of Art needs Cha Si-an
to participate in the exhibition?

529
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,033
Yes.

530
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,411
That means you really need my help.

531
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,579
Yes.

532
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,500
Then why don't you ask me
more desperately?

533
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,046
I really need your help, Da-in.

534
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,007
-I'm sorry. I can't do it.
-Hey.

535
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,594
I'm not prepared to take on anything.

536
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,515
I can't do any work
until my studio is ready.

537
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,475
Ms. Choi, if you have

538
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,436
a specific style in mind for your studio,
we could...

539
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,522
Hey, what are you doing?

540
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,856
Give it back.

541
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,608
What are you doing?

542
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,153
Hey, I said, give it back.

543
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,741
I didn't want to show you this.
What is wrong with you?

544
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,994
Do I need to be good at drawing, too?

545
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,579
The drawing is horrible,
but the arrangement is even worse.

546
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,416
Are you really going to put
your work table here?

547
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,002
I like the view.

548
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,587
Are you thinking of working here
or drinking?

549
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,755
Both.

550
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,467
I chose this place because
I liked the garden view from here.

551
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,678
The studio in New York
was a little suffocating.

552
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,054
A little?

553
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,973
It was extremely suffocating.

554
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,809
It was even worse
because you came over every day.

555
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,354
I don't think you deserve to say that
since you never kept your deadline.

556
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,981
I still haven't fixed
that habit, you know.

557
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,649
You wouldn't be Choi Da-in if you have.

558
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,696
I'm thinking about using some plants.

559
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,781
-For the interior?
-Yes.

560
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,576
I want to place
some big-sized plants inside.

561
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,911
-And kill all the trees again?
-Hey.

562
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,664
You already have plenty
of trees outside. Don't be greedy.

563
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,166
I'm saying I want to bring them indoors.

564
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,864
Can I have one?

565
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,699
Here.

566
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,078
-I like the clean taste.
-Me, too.

567
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,121
Do you have any tea by any chance?

568
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,457
Just a second.

569
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,379
Doesn't it get annoying
because he doesn't drink coffee?

570
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,089
A little.

571
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,177
Duk-mi, have you ever seen Ryan paint?

572
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,515
-No, I don't think so.
-Really?

573
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,393
I wonder if he really
stopped painting after he retired.

574
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,146
I loved seeing him paint.

575
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,775
There's something sexy
about a man totally focused on his work.

576
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,824
Did he tell you why he retired?

577
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,076
No, I never asked him.

578
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,285
I see.

579
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,498
Well, it's not like
he'd just tell anyone easily.

580
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,876
I'll take this to him.

581
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,086
Sure.

582
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,158
You said you were
going furniture shopping.

583
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,117
Did I?

584
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,077
I said I needed wood.

585
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,580
Ms. Choi, are you
going to make one yourself?

586
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,664
Yes.

587
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,473
This is mostly used
for dining tables or desks.

588
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,057
What do you think?

589
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,852
It looks good.

590
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,734
Let's go.

591
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:37,119
For a work table,
2,200mm by 1,000mm would be best.

592
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,538
Considering the space she has,

593
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,540
I think 1,600mm
would be the most efficient.

594
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,375
Sure.

595
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,030
He's quite good.

596
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,199
Is he your boyfriend?

597
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,993
-No.
-Let me help.

598
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,414
I see. She must be the girlfriend.

599
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,626
They seem to have great teamwork.

600
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,005
-No, not this.
-Why not?

601
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,507
-Excuse me.
-You could hurt yourself.

602
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,883
I won't.

603
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,177
-You'll lose your grip on it.
-I can do this.

604
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,929
Do I press this?

605
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,853
Drag it towards you as you press down.

606
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,734
Attention, bow.

607
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,570
-Good job.
-Thank you.

608
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,488
Let's go.

609
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,584
Are you interested in Duk-mi?

610
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,462
Yes.

611
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,216
I think Ms. Sung is a decent person.

612
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,014
What do you think about me?

613
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,849
Then how would you feel if a woman like me

614
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,852
told you that she likes you?

615
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,326
-Hi, Eun-gi.
-Duk-mi,

616
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,911
what time do you get off work?

617
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,122
What? I can't hear you.

618
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,416
-What's with the noise?
-Just a second.

619
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,211
-I can hear you now.
-Where are you?

620
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,797
I'm at a furniture workshop.

621
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,258
We're making furniture
for an artist's art studio.

622
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,176
Is that in a curator's job description?

623
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,471
The director's here, so of course,
the curator should do it as well.

624
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,306
Lion's there, too?

625
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,560
Yes, we might have to work all night
to finish all the pieces.

626
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,479
All night? Again?

627
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,566
Where are you?
I'll finish them in seconds for you.

628
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,942
-Really?
-Yes.

629
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,652
I'm on my way.

630
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,577
-Are they aligned?
-Yes.

631
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,924
Duk-mi!

632
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,263
Eun-gi, you really came.

633
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,558
Move.

634
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,061
Go on.

635
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,447
Be gentle or they'll snap.

636
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,907
Just do it.

637
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,836
Eun-gi, here.

638
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,757
Do you need any help?

639
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,135
No, you go and rest. Off you go.

640
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,773
Is he Ms. Sung's friend?

641
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,608
I feel bad about all this.

642
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,819
It seems like he wanted
to do some carpentry.

643
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,915
Would this be enough?
You're probably exhausted.

644
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,876
It won't, so please reconsider
working with Cha Si-an.

645
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,758
Gosh, I'm starving.

646
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,476
Order whatever's delicious.
It's my treat today.

647
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,604
I'm the one
who should be buying, Ms. Choi.

648
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,190
Ms. Sung, have you decided?

649
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,653
We'll have jjajangmyeon,
jjamppong, and fried rice.

650
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,074
We always share, you see.

651
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,912
Is that so? All three dishes?

652
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,831
She's a heavy eater.

653
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,833
I'm right, aren't I?

654
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,451
Excuse me.

655
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,998
-Me?
-Thank you for helping today.

656
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,916
Oh, right.

657
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,669
You really play dirty, though.

658
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,547
"Dirty"?

659
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,844
I've been called a cutie,
a beauty, and pretty before,

660
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,971
but never dirty.

661
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,139
Especially

662
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,974
from a stranger.

663
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,310
As a stranger, it looked like you were
being excessively kind

664
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,687
to Ms. Sung Duk-mi today.

665
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,981
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

666
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,901
Duk-mi and I are close. Excessively.

667
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:09,112
Even if you're close, you're just friends.
You're not her boyfriend.

668
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,826
You seemed pathetic
in front of her boyfriend today.

669
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,290
You must not be that close
with Director Gold.

670
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,626
Since you don't know anything.

671
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,170
Those two

672
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,090
aren't really dating.

673
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,176
It's just an act.

674
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,856
What? Is there something on my face?

675
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,274
Did you enjoy the food?

676
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,861
You ate so well. Three bowls.

677
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,072
-That was because Eun-gi--
-Thank you.

678
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,874
You should take care of
your friend, Director Gold.

679
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,419
Let's go.

680
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,633
Ms. Choi, I hope you consider our request.

681
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,720
I'll see you tomorrow, Director Gold.

682
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,399
I'll send you the proposal via email.

683
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,984
I'll look forward to a positive reply.

684
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,236
It's a good opportunity
for you as well. Goodnight.

685
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,530
-I heard it's fake.
-What?

686
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:38,368
I heard you're not really dating
Ms. Sung. It's all fake.

687
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,875
-You know, that artist.
-Yes.

688
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,960
It seemed like something's going on
between her and Lion.

689
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,837
-Really?
-Yes.

690
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,255
It's obvious she likes him.

691
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,299
-Was it obvious to you, too?
-Yes.

692
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,217
Hey, you should stop your fake dating.

693
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,803
There's nothing as pitiful as being stuck
between two people--

694
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,890
I guess Ms. Choi hasn't told him
how she feels, either.

695
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,061
If she does and he refuses,
she might even lose him as a friend.

696
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,329
FANPAGE MANAGER: FADEJANG
MEMBERS: 12

697
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,331
Why aren't we getting any new members?

698
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,293
Should I tell him to perform more?

699
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:31,922
Honey.

700
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,094
Seung-min, what brings you here
at this hour?

701
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,429
I thought you had a story to cover.

702
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,932
Yes, it happened to be
just around the corner.

703
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,393
-Can I get a cup of coffee?
-Do you want an Americano?

704
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,770
No.

705
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,313
Instead of coffee,

706
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,650
how about a parfait?

707
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,859
A parfait?

708
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,570
Isn't that from ages ago?

709
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,116
I was reminded of how much
I enjoyed it during college.

710
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,786
-It's delicious.
-It is.

711
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,955
Can you make something similar
for me, honey?

712
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,122
Okay.

713
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,086
You're so kind.

714
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,741
WHITE OCEAN

715
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,828
DUK-MI'S FILES

716
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,289
All right.

717
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,541
Honey, do you want strawberry ice cream?

718
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,001
Yes, sure.

719
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,420
-Strawberry?
-Yes.

720
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,047
-And some chocolate, too.
-Okay.

721
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,430
COPYING WHITE OCEAN FOLDER

722
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,406
Thank you for making time
despite your busy schedule.

723
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,743
No, I'm the one who's grateful
for interviewing me.

724
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,079
I've cleared Director Gold's
schedule for today,

725
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,540
so don't worry about the time
and interview him all you want.

726
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,584
Will that be okay?

727
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,085
Of course.

728
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,182
Why isn't she answering?

729
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,018
-Who?
-Ms. Choi.

730
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,521
I need to send her the proposal,
but she isn't answering her phone.

731
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,898
Really?

732
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,569
Print it out. I'll take it to her myself.

733
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,196
Okay.

734
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,377
Ms. Choi.

735
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,006
Ms. Sung. What brings you here?
You didn't even call.

736
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,717
We kept calling you,
but you didn't answer.

737
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,679
I left my phone in my bedroom.

738
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,099
Why are you working alone?
You should've called me.

739
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,476
I had to clear my head.

740
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,228
Still, I'll help you.

741
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,772
-No, it's fine.
-One, two, three.

742
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,150
-Over here?
-Yes.

743
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,460
Here we go. Is this the right place?

744
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,071
I have one last question.

745
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,158
Since you're so well-known for your taste,

746
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,534
is there

747
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,830
a particular artist in Korea
that you would like to

748
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,540
work together with?

749
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,975
Director Gold?

750
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,648
That's Cheum Museum of Art's
confidential information.

751
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:07,155
I've seen many world-class
works of art here in Korea.

752
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,658
However, art cannot exist with just

753
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,077
a piece of art itself.

754
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,206
The public needs to see and feel it

755
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,041
for its value to be recognized.

756
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,168
As the director of Cheum Museum of Art,

757
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:23,088
I want to change the perception
that art is dull and difficult

758
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,801
through exhibitions that can
appeal to the public easily.

759
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,137
So the Celebrity Collectors' Exhibition
will be a stepping stone.

760
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,598
I'll look forward to your exhibition.

761
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,808
Thank you.

762
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,851
Thank you for today.

763
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,980
I'm just asking this out of
my personal curiosity.

764
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:45,026
After your term ends here,
do you plan on returning to New York?

765
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,320
-I'm not sure.
-Have you thought of getting

766
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,280
married in Korea and living here?

767
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,949
-Sorry?
-I mean,

768
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,118
if you date a Korean woman,

769
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,912
you might want to start living in Korea.

770
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,540
I'll think about it.

771
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,042
Think about it? Does that mean

772
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,169
you're dating now?

773
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,102
Hey. You should get ready for a wedding.

774
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,312
Yes, I'm serious.

775
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,150
If it weren't for you,
I would've been in serious trouble.

776
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,359
Thank you.

777
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,988
You know that I had
other intentions, right?

778
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,784
This is the proposal for the exhibition
and Cha Si-an's album.

779
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,327
You don't have to give me that.

780
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,205
I've decided to do it.

781
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,582
Really?

782
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,000
Thank you.

783
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,086
There's no need to thank me.
I have other intentions, too.

784
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,967
I want to stay by Ryan and work with him.

785
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,138
I like Ryan.

786
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,226
It doesn't matter, right?

787
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,812
Since you're in
a fake relationship anyway.

788
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,318
How did you know?

789
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,611
I heard

790
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,864
that he's pretending to date you
in order to help you.

791
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,994
You know,

792
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,457
Ryan no longer wants to carry on
with the fake relationship.

793
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,378
I heard you're not really dating Ms. Sung.

794
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,171
It's all fake.

795
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,216
People might think you're really jealous.

796
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,343
Why are you so immersed in your fake role?

797
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,095
When was I jealous?

798
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,027
I was jealous.

799
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,991
What do you mean?

800
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,497
I was jealous.

801
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,174
I should stop

802
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,387
the fake relationship.

803
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,767
That was such a dirty move.

804
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:37,342
BUTTERFLY, GERBERA

805
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:45,433
DELPHINIUM, STOKE

806
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,113
ROSE

807
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,867
You know,

808
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:49,080
Ryan no longer wants to carry on
with the fake relationship.

809
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,011
Ms. Sung, I have something to say.

810
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,431
Can you come to the parking lot?

811
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,279
I like you.

812
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,824
I really do.

813
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,872
I've come to like you.

814
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,524
I...

815
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,569
like you.

816
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,117
Ms. Sung.

817
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,411
I like the way

818
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,749
you say my name.

819
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:20,713
I like the way you smile
when you look at me.

820
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,688
There's something

821
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,066
I really wanted to say to you today.

822
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,029
It may sound unexpected, but you see...

823
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,197
Director Gold.

824
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,785
But a love confession

825
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,955
is more about the other person

826
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,541
than yourself.

827
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,334
You can go first.

828
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,133
Thank you so much
for helping me until now.

829
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,014
But I think

830
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,061
we should end our fake relationship now.

831
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,817
What?

832
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,655
I sincerely thank you for your help.

833
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,495
Ms. Sung.

834
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,089
My feelings for you

835
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,135
will be kept to myself.

836
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:37,391
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU ARE SINCERE

837
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,620
Yes. I did the right thing
not to tell him how I feel.

838
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,913
My gosh!

839
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,915
Thanks for everything.

840
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:46,252
-Ms. Sung.
-As you can see, I'm a little busy.

841
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:50,089
Why do we need to suffer
because of their breakup?

842
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,008
I'm glad I came to Korea.

843
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,467
It's nice to see you often.

844
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,094
They think you cheated on her.

845
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,596
How could I get dumped
when I didn't even go out with her?

846
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,265
I need to set things straight.

847
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,268
-If you have nothing to say...
-Ms. Sung, I...
