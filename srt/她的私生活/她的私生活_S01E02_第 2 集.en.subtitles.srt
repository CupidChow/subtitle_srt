1
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,522
Do you work here?

2
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,066
Yes, just a moment.

3
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,696
May I help you?

4
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,669
Do you want it?

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,511
Do you want it?

6
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,889
My gosh!

7
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,116
For the sake of maintaining your life,
there are times

8
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,952
when you have to act like you are not
a fangirl, and don't know what that is.

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,080
In other words, you have to pretend
like you're just a normal person.

10
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,957
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

11
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,669
Why didn't you study abroad
after graduating from art school?

12
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,963
My dream was to observe
other artists' pieces and--

13
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,632
You didn't have the talent?
Or was it money?

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,636
-There were difficulties, but--
-Bo-gyung,

15
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,721
how is the chairman doing?

16
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,600
Yes. My father sends his regards,
and thanks you for the drawing.

17
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,478
It was meant for the chairman's office
of GN Group,

18
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,605
so I put extra care into it.

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,982
He loves it.

20
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,608
Has she already been chosen?

21
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,819
Bo-gyung, you and I seem to really click.

22
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,161
Excuse me.

23
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,837
My daughter. Isn't it time for you to be
at school?

24
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,923
I wonder who just spent
five million won at Moon Track.

25
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,342
Is her daughter a fan of an idol group?

26
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,679
Why did you buy 300 albums?

27
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,639
Do you have 600 ears?

28
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,809
You have to get in line
at a fansign event?

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,770
Then you should've arrived there
earlier and waited in line.

30
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,480
Why would you need to
spend all that money?

31
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,985
Hyo-jin, get a refund immediately
before your dad finds out.

32
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,948
Is Hyo-jin on her way to a fansign event?

33
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,453
They make you get in line according
to the number of albums you buy.

34
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,956
In order to make sure you get in,
you need to buy 300 albums at least.

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,378
Bo-gyung, you must enjoy going to
idol fansign events.

36
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,881
I go sometimes to see idols that I like.

37
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,842
What about you, Ms. Sung?

38
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,345
Have you ever been to
an idol fansign event?

39
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,894
No.

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,440
I have no idea
what you're talking about right now.

41
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,567
What were you talking about?

42
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,944
That's right.

43
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,780
This is what a normal person is like.

44
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,032
Ms. Sung, you may come to work
starting tomorrow.

45
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,867
-Really?
-Yes.

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,746
Director Eom, you said the interview
was meaningless, and told me--

47
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,291
There's no such thing
as a meaningless interview!

48
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,626
Oh, my.

49
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:17,298
I'm seriously sick and tired of
my daughter being a fangirl.

50
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,801
Do I have to have an employee
who's a fangirl, too?

51
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,469
If you're a fan of idols,

52
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,639
don't even dream of taking one step
into my museum.

53
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,849
Goodbye.

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,434
Mr. Kim!

55
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,272
I, Sung Duk-mi, am an expert
at acting like a normal person.

56
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,482
But my cover is about to be blown.

57
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,570
-May I help you?
-Where is the director's office?

58
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,905
The director's office?

59
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,242
There's no need for Director Eom to know.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
So you do remember.

61
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,581
Well...

62
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,750
I know it's a memory you're not proud of.

63
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,673
I guess you don't want Director Eom
to find out about that.

64
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,470
If she knows, she won't be pleased.

65
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,474
If you answer my question,
I'll keep it a secret.

66
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,602
Who is your client?

67
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,104
Sorry?

68
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,525
The person who made that request.

69
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,573
The client who asked you to purchase
Lee Sol's drawing.

70
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,663
Were you talking about
what happened at the auction?

71
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,585
Did we ever meet somewhere
besides the auction?

72
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,003
No, we haven't.

73
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,673
Also, I can't tell you about my client.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,009
-It's confidential information--
-It's Cha Si-an, isn't it?

75
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,970
-Cha Si-an?
-Cha Si-an of White Ocean.

76
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,597
You don't know him?

77
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,643
Cha Si-an? I think I've heard of him.

78
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,729
I'm not familiar with idols.

79
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,856
They all look pretty-faced,
and I don't know who is who.

80
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,401
And I hate pretty-faced guys.
I resent them.

81
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,657
By the way, why are you here?

82
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,502
Today, I

83
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,589
pretended not to know the person I love.

84
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,134
And I lied that I hated him.

85
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,888
I had no choice since I was
pretending to be a normal person.

86
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,601
But still, even if that were true,

87
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,646
how could I say I resented him?

88
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,278
I have sinned greatly.

89
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,671
Si-an.

90
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,550
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,511
Please forgive me.

92
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,268
Si-an.

93
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,913
I'd like to introduce to you
Cheum Museum's new director.

94
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,832
My name is Ryan Gold.

95
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,377
I can't believe I badmouthed Si-an
because of that jerk.

96
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,385
Really?

97
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,805
You guys can welcome me later.

98
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,977
Our first encounter should be done
in a happy atmosphere.

99
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,021
But I don't think
that's going to be possible.

100
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,736
My gosh.

101
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,076
Why does that jerk have my notebook?

102
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,462
I looked into Cheum Museum
after I was offered a position here.

103
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,464
I was very much impressed.

104
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,510
Every exhibition you held here
was all pretty much similar.

105
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,515
I couldn't tell if this was an art museum
or a place to show off one's connections.

106
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,477
You should have some conscience
and hold a proper exhibition

107
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,771
-as people who work in a museum.
-Well...

108
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,358
The exhibitions we held
weren't exactly that horrible.

109
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,777
If you read the evaluations and articles--

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,737
I read every single one.

111
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,823
The media were all saying the same thing.

112
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,951
It was as if they were written
by one person.

113
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,787
It seemed like someone copied
the news release.

114
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,830
Who's the head curator?

115
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,590
I enjoyed reading them.

116
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,222
All right. I won't ask you guys for much.

117
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,015
I'll only ask you to do one thing.

118
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,978
I want you to forget about
your former director's connections.

119
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,731
Shouldn't we discuss that
with Director Eom first?

120
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,899
Director Eom?

121
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,359
Who's that?

122
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,364
I thought I was the director
of Cheum Museum of Art

123
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,949
starting from today.

124
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,450
I'm sorry, Director Gold.

125
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,967
Thank you for welcoming me.

126
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,609
Director, wait. Director Gold.

127
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,985
Director Gold.

128
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,742
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for coming to our museum as the director

129
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,785
when we're currently
in a difficult situation.

130
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,913
I'll keep your assessment
about Cheum in mind

131
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,750
and use that to self-reflect
and improve things.

132
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,876
Okay.

133
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,127
But...

134
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,296
I do

135
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,797
have to say

136
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,551
that you also made me feel a little upset.

137
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,556
Cheum Museum of Art is very different

138
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,267
compared to Mono Art Gallery,
where you used to work at.

139
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,770
Our museum isn't run by
sponsorships and donations.

140
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,439
-Its parent company, TK Group--
-So, it was just used

141
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,316
to establish a positive image
for the company?

142
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,445
The former director had a lot of influence
on the management of the museum.

143
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,281
But we, the employees, still did
our best even in that situation.

144
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,533
So I hope you won't perceive us
with a biased mind.

145
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,454
Let me ask you one thing.

146
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,498
Did your former director
seem competent enough

147
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,167
to plan an exhibition all by herself?

148
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,088
-Well...
-I guess not.

149
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,215
But you're saying you couldn't
say no to her orders

150
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,926
because she and her family
owns the company,

151
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,220
and the museum was practically hers.

152
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,849
Are you the type who succumbs to power?

153
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,643
Director Gold.

154
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,062
I'm quite fond of those types of people.

155
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,106
People who surrender to their situation.

156
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,733
People who have no thought,
taste, or ego of their own.

157
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,985
People who just follow orders.

158
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,906
You should keep it up.

159
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,796
He wants you guys to cut ties
with all my connections? Why?

160
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,090
Is he not going to proceed with
the exhibitions as planned?

161
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,634
I think that's what he means.

162
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,971
A genius artist
who became the first Korean director

163
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,223
of Mono Art Gallery.

164
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,643
I scouted him because he'd be great
for publicity.

165
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,021
But he's actually trying to take over.
What do you think?

166
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,900
You met him at the auction
and the airport.

167
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,735
And now, he's the director?

168
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,030
Do you think you guys are meant to be?

169
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,326
I shouldn't say something
so horrible to my friend.

170
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,579
He told me that he likes people

171
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,081
who have no thought,
taste, or ego of their own,

172
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,250
and people who just follow orders.

173
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,420
That's the same thing as telling me
to obey everything he says.

174
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,466
What's wrong with him?
He came from the land of freedom.

175
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,430
All bosses are lunatics regardless
of which country you're in.

176
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,725
You should be grateful that
he didn't see your face at the airport.

177
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,436
Imagine what would've happened
if he saw you.

178
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,232
That gives me the chills.

179
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,569
It's okay.

180
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,779
-It's okay.
-You're right.

181
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,620
How are you so wise?

182
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,246
I was wise ever since we were young.

183
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,915
Seriously.

184
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,710
But he's seriously crazy.

185
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,547
I like this person.

186
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,300
But we're not exactly able
to see each other very easily.

187
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,772
Thank you. Thank you so much.

188
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,899
Bless you. Thank you.

189
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,450
We got the suite!

190
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,119
How did you get that?
Does that mean we can do it?

191
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,413
-Yes, totally!
-We can do it!

192
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,387
What a relief.

193
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,013
I'm so glad he didn't see me
at the airport.

194
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,515
Exactly.

195
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,100
My gosh, seriously.

196
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,442
Hey,

197
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,694
Seon-ju.

198
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,946
Did you put Geon-u to sleep?

199
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,241
Let me get this straight.
I'm not his nanny.

200
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,785
Did you guys eat?

201
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,830
-We ate chicken.
-I told you to feed him rice.

202
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,001
-What's wrong with her?
-Don't bother her.

203
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,461
She almost had to come out
as a fangirl at work today.

204
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,756
What's the big deal about that?

205
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,928
COMING OUT AS A FANGIRL:
TELLING OTHERS THAT YOU'RE A FANGIRL

206
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,514
-What?
-You have no idea

207
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,474
since you've never
had an office job before.

208
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,854
Then do you think the job I have right now

209
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,647
is some kind of after-school activity?

210
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,691
Do you know what happens to you
if you come out

211
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,693
as a fangirl at work?

212
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,778
Gosh, you like Cha Si-an?

213
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,907
That's unbelievable.
Do you even know how old he is?

214
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,408
You really have no conscience.

215
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,744
I read an article saying
Si-an's dating someone.

216
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,623
Ms. Sung, you must be devastated.

217
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,541
What?

218
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,628
You're a fan of an idol star?

219
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:25,966
Get out.

220
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,844
Not a single art museum
in this entire world

221
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,639
will hire you.

222
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,519
What scares me the most
is getting outed as a fangirl.

223
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,813
Why can't you just ignore
what other people say?

224
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,274
It's way better than always being
so nervous about getting caught.

225
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:47,029
Do you know what people call
female curators who like idol stars?

226
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,280
A groupie?

227
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,949
They're curators.

228
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,869
Regardless of who they like,
curators are still curators.

229
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,830
But you guys call
each other groupies, too.

230
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,249
It's okay for us to call each other that.

231
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,585
But other people shouldn't.

232
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,462
It's a way of diminishing us.

233
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,757
What's so wrong about calling
a groupie a groupie?

234
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,716
I mean...

235
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,928
People like you are the reason why

236
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,264
I can't tell anyone
that I'm a fangirl, you punk.

237
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,270
Did you forget who helped you
be a fangirl behind your mom's back?

238
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,690
If I decide to tell her...

239
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,487
If you do...

240
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,116
Do you think I'll die alone?

241
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,867
Of course not.

242
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,371
You guys grew up together,
so you guys should die together as well.

243
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,499
I'll bury you right next to Duk-mi.

244
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,389
What are you doing? Who's that?

245
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,934
"Ryan Gold."

246
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,395
Director Gold?

247
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,064
Even lunatics fall into
different categories.

248
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,443
I didn't know which one he was,
but he turns out to be an artist.

249
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,448
"Eight years ago,
from his very first exhibition,

250
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
people started calling him a genius.

251
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,208
He was known for his unique style
that went against the trend."

252
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,254
I'm sure his looks
were also why he got noticed.

253
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,173
He's handsome.

254
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,468
It's too bad he has an awful temper,
though.

255
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,763
His foster mother is Korean.

256
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,890
"Three years back, he suddenly retired.

257
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,517
Then he became
the director of Mono Art Gallery.

258
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,270
Currently, he's enjoying the reputation
of a genius director."

259
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,189
Interesting, right?

260
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,566
He won't be easy to please.

261
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,258
Don't push!

262
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,556
The meeting will begin in ten minutes.

263
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,559
Right.

264
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,979
My car...

265
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,524
When will I receive it?

266
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,509
Things were so hectic yesterday

267
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,469
that I wasn't able
to introduce myself properly.

268
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,013
I am Curator Sung Duk-mi.

269
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,807
I hope we get along well.

270
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,102
Ms. Sung Duk-mi

271
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,895
and Ms. Yu Gyeong-a.

272
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,815
I memorized your names, so that's enough.

273
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,902
We should sit.

274
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,618
We got you what we drink

275
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,329
since we don't know
how you take your coffee.

276
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,582
I won't be drinking coffee in meetings,

277
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,292
so you don't have to know that.

278
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,793
Let's see the exhibition proposal.

279
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,671
This is for Cheum's
fifth-anniversary exhibition.

280
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,470
I see it's Ahn Myeong-seop's
solo exhibition.

281
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,597
Yes.

282
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,226
He just had a group exhibition
eight months ago.

283
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,563
Don't you think it's too soon?

284
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,607
-No?
-Well...

285
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,650
Director Eom, our former director insisted

286
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,320
on Mr. Ahn's participation
in the group exhibition.

287
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,363
He agreed in exchange
for a solo exhibition later.

288
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,448
That's a risky move.

289
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,701
He only showed a few of his recent works
in the group exhibition, though.

290
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,288
For the fifth-anniversary
special exhibition, we'll be presenting

291
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,333
his early works to the ones
he's most known for.

292
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,460
That's how you'll differentiate the two?

293
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,339
Why not come up
with a completely different exhibition?

294
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,799
Present something more special instead.

295
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,884
Are you saying

296
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,930
that we should cancel
Mr. Ahn's exhibition?

297
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,973
That's an easier way to put it.

298
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,976
Let's cancel Mr. Ahn's exhibition.

299
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,729
For the fifth-anniversary exhibition,

300
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,650
we'll have celebrities
show their collections instead.

301
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,693
We can't. Not when--

302
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,737
Artworks owned by celebrities.

303
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,740
Wouldn't it naturally

304
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,368
guide the public
to show more interest in art?

305
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,412
Also, the profit raised will be devoted

306
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,873
to supporting rookie artists
and the culturally disadvantaged.

307
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,833
I already count three positive outcomes.

308
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,338
I don't know if it's my place to say this.

309
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,924
-You shouldn't.
-We'll also lose three things.

310
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,134
Mr. Ahn's trust,

311
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,679
our reputation in the industry,

312
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,390
and peace within the museum.

313
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,941
Ms. Yu.

314
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,317
Yes?

315
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,820
Write up a proposal
with the ideas I mentioned.

316
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,947
-You're dismissed.
-Sure.

317
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,663
I knew he was a lunatic.

318
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,498
A handsome lunatic.

319
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,502
It's her.

320
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
The original lunatic.

321
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,340
Yes, Director Eom.

322
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,009
The hospital?

323
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,802
Right now?

324
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,768
I guess I judged you wrong.

325
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,280
Someone without an opinion or ego

326
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,865
who bows to authority.

327
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,908
That's who I thought you were.

328
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,413
How did you manage to work here
without voicing your opinions?

329
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,914
It's not like I didn't speak up.

330
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,335
The former director would never listen.

331
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,963
Insubordination is only possible
when there's proper communication.

332
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,716
You do know what
insubordination means, right?

333
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,762
You mean rebelling
without knowing your place, right?

334
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,016
You're badmouthing someone
who's not present very easily.

335
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,311
I don't mind saying it
to people's faces, either.

336
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,687
Do you want to see?

337
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,024
That's why

338
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,736
I prayed that the new director
would be someone I can communicate with.

339
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,573
We can communicate, but we don't
seem to be on the same page.

340
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,408
Is that it?

341
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,534
That's not much of an insult.

342
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,869
Anyway, just know

343
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,580
that we can't cancel Mr. Ahn's exhibition.

344
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,916
You may voice your opinion all you want,

345
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,377
but you're not in the position
to make final decisions.

346
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,880
That is up to me and Mr. Ahn.

347
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,098
Set up a meeting for the two of us.

348
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,849
Will that be possible?

349
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,686
Yes.

350
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,944
We'll keep the cancellation a secret
until the meeting.

351
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,196
I will tell him in person.

352
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,615
That'll be all, then.

353
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,593
The new director wants to see me?

354
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,429
-Yes, sir.
-Regarding what?

355
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,811
He wishes to introduce himself
and talk to you.

356
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,105
-He must have bad news.
-Sorry?

357
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,399
Well...

358
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,111
You really are a terrible liar.

359
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,576
I'd rather have you tell me the bad news.

360
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,254
Get home safely, then.

361
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,506
I'm really sorry, sir.

362
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,429
Don't tell the new director
that I already know.

363
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,723
When we meet, I'll tell him

364
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,808
that I'm canceling for a personal reason.

365
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,852
I'd rather keep my pride.

366
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,063
Does that make me a loser?

367
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,816
No, of course not. Please don't say that.

368
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,235
I'm truly sorry about this.

369
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,054
CHEUM MUSEUM OF ART

370
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,434
Where's Director Gold?

371
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,311
He's taking promotional photos
in the art gallery.

372
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,729
-Okay.
-Sure.

373
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,150
Can you turn slightly? Yes, that's great.

374
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,653
A little to the right.
Yes, be more natural.

375
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,655
Okay, good.

376
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,948
All right. Again.

377
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,533
Director Gold,
I have the project proposal.

378
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,619
-Place it on my desk, please.
-Sure.

379
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,332
Let's do this one more time. Good.

380
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,751
All right. Good job.

381
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,962
Can I get a smile?

382
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,546
Okay.

383
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,716
Director Gold?

384
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,804
Isn't he here?

385
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,826
My gosh! Director Gold.

386
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,662
How was the photoshoot?

387
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,289
Sorry?

388
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,666
Aren't you taking any in your office?

389
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,669
The sunlight comes through here,
so it's a great photo spot.

390
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,380
I see that you're done, though.

391
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,923
Good job, then.

392
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,655
Wait, the proposal.

393
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,167
Something came for you.
"Content-certified mail"?

394
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,673
THIS PACKAGE IS CONTENT-CERTIFIED MAIL

395
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,399
It was the perfect chance
to get my notebook back.

396
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,906
Why on earth does he lock his drawers?

397
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,452
He has so many secrets,
just like his mysterious face.

398
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,693
Hello?

399
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,237
Where are you right now?

400
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,989
I'm at the storage room. Can I...

401
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,412
Can I help you with something?

402
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,759
Get out.

403
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:40,969
What?

404
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,805
Only employees of this museum
can enter the storage room. Get out.

405
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,975
Director Gold, what do you mean?

406
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,602
It means

407
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,355
you are no longer
an employee of this museum.

408
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,607
You're fired.

409
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,650
Fired?

410
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,318
Me?

411
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,821
Why?

412
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,749
REQUEST TO RECTIFY BREACH OF CONTRACT

413
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,712
-How could this--
-It's strange, isn't it?

414
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,006
How did Mr. Ahn know

415
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,425
that the exhibition would be
canceled and send this?

416
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,553
Well...

417
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,140
I did tell him that his exhibition
would be canceled.

418
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,184
I told you that I'd tell him myself.

419
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,812
As the main curator who handled
Mr. Ahn's work

420
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,773
-for the last five years--
-As the main curator,

421
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,900
you didn't even know
how he'd react to this?

422
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,818
Have you learned nothing
while working here?

423
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,744
I'm sorry I couldn't keep it confidential.

424
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,749
But even if it weren't me who told him,
the result would be the same.

425
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,877
-Even if you told him, it would--
-How could it be the same?

426
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,130
If I was the one who told him,
I would've suggested an alternative.

427
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,298
For example...

428
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,845
For example,
a solo exhibition in New York.

429
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,360
By any chance,

430
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,029
did you get rid of
the proposal on my desk?

431
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,910
No, I didn't even see the proposal.

432
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,541
I have too many doubts to believe
what you say.

433
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,253
Get out.

434
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,684
If anyone thinks it's unfair,
you may leave with her.

435
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,216
MR. AHN

436
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,928
Mr. Ahn, this is Sung Duk-mi
from Cheum Museum of Art.

437
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,517
I'm sorry about my sudden visit last time
and I know you must've felt insulted.

438
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,605
I want to meet you in person
and apologize.

439
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,816
Please give me one more chance.

440
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,827
I don't think Ms. Sung will come
to work today.

441
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,788
How could she really not come?

442
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,458
She has to come
and try something at least. Goodness.

443
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,834
The director is coming.

444
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,796
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

445
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,646
Sesame oil.

446
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,029
Perfect.

447
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,048
This song will be easy to appeal
to the public.

448
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,969
I'm making it with the hope
that many people will sing it together.

449
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,514
I can't wait to reveal it
to the whole world.

450
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,558
The only thing I don't get sick of
even if I do it 24 hours a day

451
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,435
is looking at my love, Si-an.

452
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,148
I don't have time to feel depressed.
It's his loss if he fires me.

453
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,656
You've all done a great job
working and studying

454
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,157
all day today.

455
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,784
I'll see you later, then.

456
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,245
Bye.

457
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,833
He should say goodbye
to jobless people, too.

458
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,210
I'm jobless.

459
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,806
Come home right now.

460
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,398
I'm home.

461
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,196
-What?
-Quiet.

462
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,868
Can't you feel this cold air
flowing in this house?

463
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,454
Are Mom and Dad fighting?

464
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,998
But Mom sent me a text.

465
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,624
I sent it.

466
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,918
Why are they fighting?

467
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,253
It's Dad.

468
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,756
I knew things were too peaceful lately.

469
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,925
The loser sides with Dad.
Rock-paper-scissors!

470
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,093
Yes!

471
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,887
I'll side with Mom.

472
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,440
She's old and wrinkly now.

473
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,443
It's natural for her body
to ache here and there.

474
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,529
But what? Artificial joints?

475
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,742
Look at our house.
Do you think we can even afford that?

476
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,245
Are you blind
or are you just plain ignorant?

477
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,624
You know it's impossible.
Why do you keep bringing it up?

478
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,546
Grandma is Dad's mom.

479
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,466
He's just worried since his mom is ill.

480
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,635
Aren't you worried about me?

481
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,680
Do you think I go to work at dawn
because my joints are perfectly fine?

482
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,724
My body aches, too.

483
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,563
We all know how hard you work, Mom.

484
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,027
I'm the only one struggling all the time.

485
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,280
You lost all our money
from that business of yours.

486
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,574
The only thing you do is collect
those meaningless rocks.

487
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,204
You have no conscience at all,
but you still care so much for your mom.

488
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,999
Fine.

489
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,960
Let her have surgery.

490
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,255
What choice do I have?
It's my fault for marrying a mama's boy.

491
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,385
Just take all our money and use it
for your mom's new joints

492
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,347
or build a memorial stone for your
filial piety. Do whatever you want.

493
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,228
-Mom.
-Shut it!

494
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,398
Do you think I want to live
such a tough life?

495
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,819
It's my wish to work at an art museum
and show off just like you.

496
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,739
I've raised you all my life
and you're taking your dad's side.

497
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,032
Goodness.

498
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,369
Both of you are of no help at all.

499
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,707
I can't stand the sight of you.
Just get out!

500
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,837
Why should I go out?

501
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,717
Am I someone who has to leave
just like that if you tell me to?

502
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,470
What's wrong with you?

503
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,471
What?

504
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,765
"Show off at an art museum"?

505
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,478
You don't even know how I work
and how I'm treated there.

506
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,276
What? Is someone treating you badly?

507
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,240
Did you see that?
Duk-mi has become like this

508
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,825
-because of you--
-Stop it!

509
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,206
Here.

510
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,542
Dad, use this for Grandma's surgery.

511
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,796
Mom, use this and buy something good
for your health.

512
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,381
I'm leaving.

513
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,967
Duk-mi, wait.

514
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,472
Mom, I'll go talk to her.

515
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,574
What's wrong with you today?

516
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,078
Did something happen?

517
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,289
No.

518
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,667
I wish something would happen.

519
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,337
Duk-mi.

520
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,174
Seon-ju's here.

521
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,473
The woman with the most beautiful
cheekbone in Korea is here.

522
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,268
Seon-ju is even greater than a deity!

523
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,312
Seon-ju, can I have 3,000 won
so I can buy myself some soju?

524
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,108
Let's have some soju.

525
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,543
Come on.

526
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,590
I got fired.

527
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,676
What?

528
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,848
I got fired from Cheum!

529
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,118
Duk-mi,

530
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,996
did you just say "okay" when he fired you?

531
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,291
You should've treated him
just like how you treat Eun-gi.

532
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,586
Hey, isn't it an unlucky year
according to her zodiac sign?

533
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,590
HUSBAND

534
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,261
Eun-gi, we were all born in the same year.

535
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,263
It should be the same for all of us.

536
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,931
I see.

537
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,143
Then why is she the only one
who's so unfortunate?

538
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,145
And why would she give
her credit card to her parents?

539
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,730
She should be taking care of her own self.

540
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,024
Exactly.

541
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,444
HUSBAND
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK

542
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,489
Hey, I have to go.

543
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,575
My husband has to go because he got
a call from the informant.

544
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,701
Hey, wait.

545
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,453
What about her?

546
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,413
What else can we do?

547
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,248
We can't live her life for her.

548
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,250
We spent our money and time on her,
and that's enough.

549
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,921
You're so coldhearted but cool.

550
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,673
Duk-mi, you should go home now.

551
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,051
What's the point of
being depressed about it?

552
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,095
If you're going to stay home
and act all pathetic,

553
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,554
come to my cafe and work part-time.

554
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,849
People can always betray you,
but money never does.

555
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,568
We have really handsome customers.

556
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,612
We have a regular who's good-looking.

557
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,157
He kind of looks like Si-an.

558
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,287
-Then...
-Yes?

559
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,664
Can I drink one more bottle of soju?

560
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,957
The cafe opens at 8 a.m.

561
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,376
-Take her home, okay?
-Hey.

562
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,346
Ryan.

563
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,433
That damn lion.

564
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,272
I'm going to catch him alive
and feed him nothing but grass.

565
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,276
I'm not going to give him soju.

566
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,364
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

567
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,951
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

568
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,286
Nice.

569
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,497
Mom's here!

570
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,626
You came home a while ago.
Why are you leaving so soon?

571
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,670
I'm not leaving because I want to.

572
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,380
I'll see you guys.

573
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,050
Why does that informant always
change his mind when the sun sets?

574
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,719
I know, right?

575
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,429
Dad, come back later!

576
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,438
I promise that I'll switch
to a variety show this year.

577
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,902
I'll be back, okay?

578
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,154
See you.

579
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,156
Visit us often, honey.

580
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,242
Let's go.

581
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,059
He's our new regular. Isn't he handsome?

582
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:08,025
You should say hello. He's my former boss
and former director of my former job.

583
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,154
Are you a regular here?

584
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,658
Let me ask you out of curiosity.
Are you going to keep coming here?

585
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,159
-Do you have time?
-Yes.

586
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,246
I got fired thanks to someone,
so I have a lot of time.

587
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,915
Well, I don't, because someone
stabbed me in the back.

588
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,667
Why don't you take my order?

589
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,587
-What would you like?
-Warm milk with condensed milk.

590
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,924
Sir, we don't have that kind of menu here.

591
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,180
He drinks lattes with condensed milk
without the espresso shot.

592
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,432
Without the espresso shot?

593
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,061
Why can't he just buy milk
at the convenience store?

594
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,814
It's not the same as ordinary milk.

595
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,857
You'll be adding condensed milk.

596
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,070
I don't want the espresso shot,
so please just do as I say.

597
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,906
Why would you leave out the espresso shot?

598
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,492
Don't you know how big of a role
the espresso shot has in a latte?

599
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,619
How would the espresso feel
hearing that you don't want it?

600
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,456
Do you even know how it would feel
to get kicked out like that?

601
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,960
Your latte with condensed milk without
espresso will be ready soon.

602
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,086
I'll take your credit card.

603
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,051
This is not a polite way to treat lattes.

604
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,178
How good would that even taste?

605
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,307
It's hot.

606
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,146
I'll see you again.

607
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,901
He doesn't drink coffee.

608
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,279
He must really care about his health.

609
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,699
What did you say?
A handsome regular that looks like Si-an?

610
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,367
You should get eye surgery.

611
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,536
You saw the photo I took of him
at the airport.

612
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,331
You know that I have trouble
recognizing people's faces

613
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,291
since giving birth to Geon-u.

614
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,462
No, don't go. Ju-hyeok won't be
coming because of his exams.

615
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,672
And I need to go pick up Geon-u later.

616
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,217
I can't make that little kid
walk over here all by himself.

617
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,886
Let me go.

618
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,138
I'll do the dishes.

619
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,265
Wear rubber gloves.

620
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,021
Is she bold or dumb?

621
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,195
Why would she do something
she can't even take care of?

622
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,491
Did you want to see me, Director Gold?

623
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,993
Did you get a hold of Ahn Myeong-seop?

624
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,621
-No, not yet.
-What about his family or acquaintances?

625
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,500
Well, the thing is, Ms. Sung
was in charge of communicating with him.

626
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,001
So?

627
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,628
Never mind.

628
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,423
By the way, Director Gold.

629
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,634
Did you really mean it

630
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,762
-when you fired Ms. Sung?
-Did it sound like a joke?

631
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,100
I'm going to post a job opening
for a new curator today.

632
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,103
I want you to write a list
of all the artists,

633
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,231
donators, critics, and journalists.

634
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,565
Okay, sir.

635
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,235
I'm not done talking.

636
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,738
I want a list of all the exhibitions
that were held at Cheum Museum of Art.

637
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,573
Make it clear and simple.

638
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,452
I also want a list of all
the artworks owned by this museum.

639
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,205
-What's your classification system?
-Our classification system?

640
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,083
-We use our own...
-That means you have no system.

641
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,669
Let's use the standard
international classification system.

642
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,172
And I'll send you a list of
about 30 new artists

643
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,300
who are currently
working in New York via email.

644
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,970
So thoroughly check the places
that they usually go to.

645
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,106
Ms. Yu.

646
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,442
We're in trouble.

647
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,235
-Again?
-Yes.

648
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,906
Have you made a decision?

649
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,663
One cold brew latte
and one green tea Cocomoco.

650
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,337
The painting Saebit Museum borrowed

651
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,047
came back covered in mold?

652
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,467
-Yes.
-Here are your macaroons.

653
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,343
We checked before lending it to them,

654
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,721
so check the form we filled out.
What's the problem?

655
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,514
Well...

656
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,266
Didn't you check it?

657
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,686
The exhibition schedules were a mess

658
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,022
-so things were really hectic...
-So?

659
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,732
Are you blaming the curator

660
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,193
for not properly organizing the schedule?

661
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,154
-That's not it.
-You know the curator there.

662
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,324
She asked which terrible senior
I learned work from when I called her.

663
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,368
She said what? A terrible senior?

664
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,245
That little...

665
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,498
-I didn't mean... Ms. Sung!
-She...

666
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,042
-What's wrong?
-No, wait.

667
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,110
Hello, this is Sung Duk-mi
of Cheum Museum of Art.

668
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,114
You borrowed our precious child
only to contaminate it.

669
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,995
It was already infected
when you received it?

670
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,333
Then please provide us with a list
of all the artwork you borrowed.

671
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,586
I'll see if there are any more victims
and take measures.

672
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,213
Also,

673
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,258
we'll thoroughly check our storage room,

674
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,094
so you had better check yours.

675
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,265
We'll see where this mold
actually came from.

676
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,106
Cheum and Saebit use the same
storage management company.

677
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,109
Check to see
if Saebit had any problems recently.

678
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,110
Okay.

679
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,404
I'm sorry.

680
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,447
I forgot to check it.

681
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,034
It's good to admit your mistake quickly,

682
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,036
but this must never happen again.

683
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,496
If it does...

684
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,251
Well, it shouldn't.

685
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,919
Anyway, good luck. Bye!

686
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,256
Ms. Sung.

687
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,015
Yes.

688
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,603
Mold?

689
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,734
Yes.

690
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,319
SAEBIT WILL PAY FOR THIS!

691
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,032
We all want what's best, right?

692
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,285
I'll send you the bill
after restoration is complete.

693
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,995
Sure.

694
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,168
I'll tell Ms. Sung as well.

695
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,592
Go ahead. Give me your side of the story.

696
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,929
Please take back Ms. Sung's

697
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,223
termination of employment.

698
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,475
Why should I?

699
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,102
She did nothing wrong.

700
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,856
To be honest...

701
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,486
On whose authority are you
canceling Mr. Ahn's exhibition?

702
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,781
I'll talk to him myself,

703
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,159
so go ahead with it.

704
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,454
You're saying that Director Eom

705
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,665
has his back.

706
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,500
Probably.

707
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,044
Ryan Gold will be gone

708
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,463
once my husband's trial is over.

709
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,507
Ms. Yu.

710
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,135
Who do you think
you'll be working longer with?

711
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,846
No, I'm sure.

712
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,266
Ms. Sung didn't know anything about it.

713
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,728
Then the exhibition proposal...

714
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,940
Well...

715
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,401
I was terrified,

716
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,195
and I had no choice.

717
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,323
Life taught me

718
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,952
that it's better to listen to
the ones who have the worst temper.

719
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,830
I believed that you'd have a better temper

720
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,456
than Director Eom.

721
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,879
-Thank you for the high praise.
-So please, reinstate Ms. Sung.

722
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,589
I hear you. You're dismissed.

723
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,760
Also,

724
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,179
if Director Eom finds out

725
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,808
that I told you everything,
she'll bury me.

726
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,560
-Can you keep it a secret--
-I get it.

727
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,605
The same with Ms. Sung, too.
She has quite the temper.

728
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,960
Welcome...

729
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,049
-Can we talk?
-That's not on the menu.

730
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,308
Is it fun to work here?

731
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,031
I've thought about it,

732
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,408
and I believe I may have overreacted.

733
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,202
You may not have taste,

734
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,996
but I should've acknowledged
your five-year experience at Cheum.

735
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,542
I'm sorry. I apologize.

736
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,005
Do you mean it?

737
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,261
All right. I accept your apology.

738
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,267
Good. I'll see you at work tomorrow.

739
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,436
I'm only accepting your apology.

740
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,482
Go ahead with the termination process.

741
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,861
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes, Ryan?

742
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,159
Did you think you could solve this
by just apologizing?

743
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,411
Am I supposed

744
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,207
to work there or get fired
according to your mood?

745
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,793
-That's not what I meant.
-I know what this is about.

746
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,169
You're only apologizing

747
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,381
because you need me to
take care of all the mess going on.

748
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,175
Cheum needs me to properly function.

749
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,844
Exactly.

750
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,556
That's why you should be responsible

751
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,932
and do your best until--

752
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,851
You're the one who killed me,

753
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,395
but you're telling me
to clean up my blood.

754
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,522
How can one be so selfish?

755
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,902
I understand your anger,
but please don't cross the line.

756
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,196
If you really understand,

757
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,240
you can filter my words yourself.

758
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,957
So you're saying you'll never come back?

759
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,503
No, I won't.

760
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,214
All right.

761
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,428
I guess this place suits you more anyway.

762
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,973
Thank you, sir.

763
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,018
Can I get you your regular drink?
Latte with condensed milk

764
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,061
without the espresso shot?

765
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,067
Because of someone,
I'll be working overtime.

766
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,945
I'll get an iced mint chocolate.

767
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,115
A refreshing iced mint chocolate
coming right up.

768
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,294
He's so annoying.

769
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,064
This isn't for me.

770
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,025
I can't do it.

771
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,238
Living in Korea...

772
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,293
There's no way this will work.

773
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,055
Darn, it's tasty.

774
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,108
The security system has been activated.

775
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,485
Seon-ju seems to be the one
enjoying you being jobless the most.

776
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,112
She left the whole cafe to you.

777
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,740
Right, if reality is difficult
to bear when you're sane,

778
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,450
going insane is an option.

779
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,160
I got my revenge.

780
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,829
To the director? How?

781
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,999
He's so obsessed with his health,
so he doesn't even drink coffee.

782
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,168
So I secretly mixed half a shot
in his drink.

783
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,008
Wow, talk about some revenge.

784
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,260
You could even make a movie with that.

785
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,096
Gosh, it's so cruel.

786
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,684
MR. AHN MYEONG-SEOP

787
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,520
Yes, Mr. Ahn.

788
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:19,441
I called you earlier to apologize.

789
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,192
It's all right, Ms. Sung.

790
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,987
I heard you were fired
from Cheum because of me.

791
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,238
What?

792
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,407
Oh, well...

793
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,075
I'm afraid I'm getting senile.

794
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,203
I only listened to Director Eom
and acted too hastily.

795
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,414
It's okay, don't worry about it.

796
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,878
You want to talk
with the director yourself?

797
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,300
Can you wait a second?
I'll call you right back.

798
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,301
Okay.

799
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,514
I knew it. Mr. Ahn would never
act that way.

800
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,204
That wench...

801
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,803
SUNG DUK-MI

802
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,721
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

803
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,809
Eun-gi, wait for me.

804
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,853
I need to go meet Lion.
No, I mean the director.

805
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,856
Why? Are you going to go fight him?

806
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,067
Shall I go with you?

807
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,860
I guess I will.

808
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,908
Director Gold?

809
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,453
Director Gold? I'll let myself in.

810
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,873
Director Gold, I'm Duk-mi.
Mr. Ahn just called me...

811
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,307
Director Gold!

812
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,144
Director Gold!

813
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,937
Director Gold, are you okay?

814
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,023
Director Gold! Please open your eyes.

815
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,316
Director Gold!

816
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,487
Director Gold! Open your eyes.

817
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,157
-Duk-mi.
-Eun-gi, help me.

818
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,660
-Did you kill him?
-Are you kidding me? Hurry.

819
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,707
-Which way?
-On the right.

820
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:47,338
CHEUM MUSEUM OF ART

821
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,427
A caffeine allergy?

822
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,804
He's really in this condition
because of coffee?

823
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,806
Yes, he almost died.

824
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:03,354
Gosh, I've heard about hearts racing
and being unable to sleep,

825
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,273
-but I've never...
-Yes, he almost died.

826
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,818
You may be perfectly fine
on an average day,

827
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,738
but depending on stress levels,
allergy symptoms may occur

828
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,698
or become serious.

829
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:17,494
But if he didn't usually drink coffee,

830
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,539
that means he was aware of his allergy.
I wonder what happened.

831
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,626
What if

832
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,086
someone secretly made him drink it?

833
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,423
Attempted murder?

834
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,678
Just kidding. I'll move him to
an empty room soon.

835
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,850
Duk-mi.

836
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,937
I knew you'd kill someone one day.

837
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,731
I thought that would be you.

838
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,956
He's alive.

839
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,278
I'll wipe your sweat for you.

840
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,934
I'm sorry.

841
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,831
Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

842
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,542
Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

843
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,590
Ms. Sung Duk-mi, are you home?

844
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,759
Ms. Sung Duk-mi?

845
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,137
Who is it?

846
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,556
Are you Curator Sung Duk-mi
of Cheum Museum of Art?

847
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,891
Is that you?

848
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,309
Yes.

849
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:54,687
You are under arrest for the
attempted murder of Ryan Gold.

850
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,314
Hold out your hands.

851
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,774
Do not move.

852
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,693
It will hurt if you move.

853
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,987
A fanpage master of
White Ocean's Cha Si-an.

854
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,948
-Are you "The Road to Si-an"?
-Yes.

855
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,368
You are under arrest for the assault of
Ryan Gold and identity fraud.

856
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,871
Do not move.

857
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,664
It will hurt if you move.

858
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,547
This way.

859
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,758
What...

860
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,679
What?

861
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,265
Mom! Dad! Eun-gi!

862
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,684
-My gosh.
-This is the house

863
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:37,480
of Ms. Sung, a woman in her 30s
who is a fan of an idol star.

864
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:40,942
She's been actively working
as a popular fanpage master.

865
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,693
-Please get out of the way.
-Please move.

866
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,612
-Am I really getting arrested?
-Let's go.

867
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,156
-Is this for real?
-She tried to murder

868
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,284
a man in his 30s by adding coffee
to his iced mint chocolate.

869
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,624
She had a habit of asking me
if I had a death wish.

870
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,669
She suddenly opened her wallet
and gave us her credit card.

871
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,296
So we did think that something was wrong,

872
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,923
but we never knew
that she'd commit murder.

873
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,385
Then are you saying
it was a planned murder?

874
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,557
What are you talking about?

875
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,600
Mom! Mom, what's wrong with you?

876
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,144
-Please get out of the way.
-It's not true. Don't shoot me.

877
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,438
-I didn't do it. It's not true.
-Please move.

878
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,817
I really didn't do it. No, I refuse to go!

879
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,610
No, it wasn't me.

880
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,529
It really wasn't me.

881
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,412
My goodness, you're up.

882
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,001
Here are your slippers.

883
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,505
Would you like some water?

884
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,976
Here's your water.

885
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,355
It's water. Fresh water.

886
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,773
One hundred percent water.

887
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,490
-Yesterday--
-I didn't know

888
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,243
that you were allergic to coffee
and ended up

889
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,786
making a huge mistake.

890
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,246
I'm very sorry.

891
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,754
-Yesterday--
-I must have been out of my mind.

892
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,924
I was so rude to you.
I must've been crazy.

893
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,385
-Yesterday--
-Yesterday, I was--

894
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,845
Will you please let me talk?

895
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:41,771
How did you

896
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,106
find me yesterday?

897
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,441
Oh, well...

898
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,819
Mr. Ahn told me that he'd like to call you

899
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,488
to explain what happened.

900
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,657
So I went to the museum to tell you that.

901
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,827
Did you tell him why I couldn't
get back to him?

902
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,331
Yes, it was late at night,
so I texted him.

903
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,917
He agreed to follow your idea
regarding the exhibition.

904
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,085
And he said he'll talk to you

905
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,295
regarding the details in person
once you get discharged.

906
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,635
Okay.

907
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,222
Please schedule a meeting with him.

908
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,598
Okay.

909
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,267
What?

910
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,688
Does that mean

911
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,650
you're going to forgive me?

912
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:32,446
Should I only accept your apology
like you did and just file a lawsuit?

913
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,157
No. If you give me another chance,
I'll do my best

914
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,785
to work for you and Cheum Museum of Art.

915
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,498
You can go home now.

916
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,250
Get some rest.

917
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,757
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes?

918
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,260
Instead of coming
to the museum for work tomorrow,

919
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,262
I want you to come to a meeting.

920
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,847
Are we meeting an artist?

921
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,807
We're meeting a collector.

922
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,977
It's Cha Si-an of White Ocean.

923
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,025
What?

924
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,818
We'll be asking to borrow an art piece.

925
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,862
So even if you don't like him that much,

926
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,406
I hope you'll be able to keep
your personal feelings aside.

927
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,618
Yes, sir.

928
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,920
No...

929
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,316
Si-an.

930
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,694
Si-an.

931
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,446
Si-an.

932
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,615
Si-an.

933
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,160
Si-an.

934
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,787
Cha Si-an.

935
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,213
We have a meeting
with Cha Si-an of White Ocean.

936
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,845
I'll see you at his house.

937
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,987
I've succeeded as a fan!

938
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,649
It was painted by Lee Sol,
an artist that I only know by name.

939
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,567
I fell in love with this at first sight.

940
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,738
I only have a piece from a series.

941
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,198
I SEE A LOT OF ARTWORKS IN YOUR HOUSE

942
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,700
Isn't it so beautiful?

943
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,743
SI-AN

944
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,184
Every time I look at it,
I feel touched, happy,

945
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,021
and consoled by it.

946
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,434
No way. Even if I die now,
I wouldn't have regrets.

947
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,686
Ms. Sung, do you hate Mr. Cha that much?

948
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,396
Please do a better job
at hiding your distaste.

949
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,814
Are you familiar with Lee Sol's work?

950
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,567
I found out by chance that you owned one
of Lee Sol's pieces.

951
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:46,111
Is Si-an dating someone?
It's me.

952
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:49,698
A believable lie is better
than an unbelievable truth.

953
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:53,077
I've been fangirling all these years
just for this?

954
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,245
-Don't worry about it.
-Good boy.

955
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,915
Ms. Sung. I'll just do it.

956
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,583
I'll be your boyfriend.

957
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,169
