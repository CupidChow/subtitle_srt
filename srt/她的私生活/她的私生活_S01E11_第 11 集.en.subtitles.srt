1
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,623
Is it too early?

2
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,539
Hey. Did something really happen
yesterday?

3
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,958
-What's wrong?
-It's Lion.

4
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,977
Ms. Sung.

5
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,233
Director Gold.

6
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,944
Did you come without even making plans?

7
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,862
Today is...

8
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,615
Come back next time.

9
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,381
I want to speak with Duk-mi.

10
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,349
Duk-mi

11
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,352
didn't wash her face.

12
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,981
I don't think she feels comfortable
seeing you right now.

13
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,908
I said I want to speak with Duk-mi.

14
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,499
Duk-mi says she doesn't want
to speak with you.

15
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,628
Duk-mi

16
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,298
is my girlfriend.

17
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,766
So this is between her and me.

18
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,811
It's none of your business.

19
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,691
Why isn't it my business?

20
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,612
She's the woman I like.

21
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,873
Duk-mi doesn't want herself
to be seen right now.

22
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,709
By you, Director Gold.

23
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,047
If you really care for Duk-mi,

24
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,966
please leave for now.

25
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,030
Come out, Ms. Sung.

26
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,377
It's okay.

27
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
The Road to Si-an.

28
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,910
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,871
I didn't mean to pretend not to know.

30
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,416
You should've told me if you knew.

31
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,169
Should I tell you right here?

32
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,507
-Let's go somewhere and talk.
-Duk-mi.

33
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,009
It's okay.

34
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,143
Gosh, I have a sour stomach.

35
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,521
Where did they go?

36
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,942
What?

37
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,656
Duk-mi!

38
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,911
Eun-gi.

39
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,789
Wasn't that Lion?

40
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,917
Did he find out Duk-mi is
The Road to Si-an?

41
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,254
-He already knew.
-He knew?

42
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,214
Really?

43
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,388
Seon-ju.

44
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,811
Seon-ju, I'm sorry.

45
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,148
-It's all my fault.
-You can apologize in court.

46
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,026
We've been together for so long.
We can't split up like this.

47
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,153
Please think of Geon-u.

48
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,822
We're a family!

49
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,617
Family, my ass.

50
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,994
The time we've been together
doesn't matter.

51
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,080
We can become strangers again
in an instant.

52
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,835
The thing is,

53
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,838
-Geon-u...
-What about Geon-u?

54
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,674
What is it?

55
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,219
Gosh!

56
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,723
Eun-gi, I'll call you.

57
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,010
It's okay. The Road to Si-an.

58
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,195
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,948
I didn't mean to pretend not to know.

60
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,746
When did he find out
that I'm The Road to Si-an?

61
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,208
Since when was she with Mr. Nam?

62
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,169
How on earth did he find out?

63
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,298
How could she hide when she saw me?

64
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,301
-Where are we going?
-You'll know once we get there.

65
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,803
I have the right to know
where we're going.

66
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,473
Then how about you drive instead,
The Road to Si-an?

67
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,311
How petty.

68
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,549
Let's go.

69
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,262
You want me to go to your place
dressed like this?

70
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,310
What time does
Si-an's schedule begin today?

71
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,312
My Si-an's schedule begins at 10 a.m.

72
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,651
Why did you have to bring me here
of all places?

73
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,904
We're educated people.
We can't fight out in the street.

74
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,992
Your Si-an would've left by now. Let's go.

75
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,428
Why did you bring me to your place
to fight?

76
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,097
Is it a home game or what?

77
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,640
That's so low.

78
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,727
Then should we have fought
in front of Mr. Nam?

79
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,439
Two against one? Isn't that even lower?

80
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,692
My fans waited outside all night.

81
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,528
The manager's outside dealing with them.

82
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,864
Ryan?

83
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,118
-Hey, Mr. Cha.
-What's he doing?

84
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,372
Hello, Ms. Sung.

85
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,585
Hello, Mr. Cha.

86
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,796
I'll get on the next one.
You can go up first.

87
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,464
The doors are closing.

88
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,143
Why did you get so startled?

89
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,354
It's all because of you.

90
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,607
I don't want your identity
to get revealed.

91
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,818
How do you know about that kind of stuff?

92
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,114
I studied a little
because my girlfriend is a fangirl.

93
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:26,959
Geon-u.

94
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,920
-Mom.
-Geon-u, are you sick?

95
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,090
What's the matter? Does your stomach hurt?

96
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,222
Mom, Dad says his chest hurts.

97
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:42,975
What?

98
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,443
Mom.

99
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,614
-Yes?
-Are you sick?

100
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,866
No, I'm not sick.

101
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,701
You stink.

102
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,163
It's that smell you reek of
every time you're sick.

103
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,124
Let's just get wasted.

104
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,752
It's crazy to get married.

105
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,258
Should I take you to the judo studio?

106
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,010
Let's go.

107
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,524
-Honey.
-See you, Ms. Lee.

108
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,281
Why does my hand hurt?

109
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,082
Duk-mi

110
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,334
is my girlfriend.

111
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,088
It's okay, The Road to Si-an.

112
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,178
CHOIKANG JUDO

113
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,931
-Hello!
-Hello!

114
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,101
Go on.

115
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,859
Eun-gi.

116
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,113
Duk-mi is

117
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,157
dating Director Gold.

118
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,493
Since when?

119
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,871
It's only been a few days
since they officially started dating.

120
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,500
But I don't know
when they both started liking each other.

121
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,129
Why didn't you tell me?

122
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,049
I told Duk-mi not to tell you

123
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,635
because she doesn't know

124
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,721
how you feel about her.

125
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,686
You should go. I need to teach now.

126
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,354
Eun-gi.

127
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,733
You're okay, right?

128
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,531
You're on my side, right?

129
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,368
Of course, I'm on your side.

130
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,663
You're so good at lying.

131
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,209
But do you know something?

132
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,335
What?

133
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm also on your side.

134
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,588
What are you talking about?

135
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,924
I'm saying you should hear Seung-min out.

136
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,967
I'm sure he didn't want to do what he did.

137
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,719
Stop taking his side!

138
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,393
Put on your uniforms.

139
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,394
Come here.

140
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,773
Come here. It's time for you
to get changed into your uniforms.

141
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,566
Come on. Give me your hand.

142
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,751
Did Mr. Nam

143
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,045
sleep at your place last night?

144
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,505
No, right?

145
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,924
He did.

146
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,179
I'm really curious about this.

147
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,557
How can you be so confident

148
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,561
when you got caught coming out
of your house with another guy?

149
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,856
I guess you saw Eun-gi but not Seon-ju.

150
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,692
Something happened to her yesterday,

151
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,152
so we had a few drinks together
and ended up falling asleep.

152
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,613
-And as for Eun-gi--
-He likes

153
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,948
you.

154
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,285
Why isn't it my business?

155
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,165
She's the woman I like.

156
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,835
That's...

157
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,044
That's just

158
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,797
something he said to cover for me.

159
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,843
-Is that what you really think?
-Yes.

160
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,178
Eun-gi is my family.

161
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,432
It's been that way until now,
and it'll continue to be that way.

162
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,270
Okay.

163
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,359
Should we move onto you now?

164
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,530
You're also guilty of something.

165
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,160
I don't think I did anything wrong.

166
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,205
You knew I was The Road to Si-an,
but you never told me.

167
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,667
Don't you think it was more wrong
of you to hide it from me?

168
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,711
It's not like I planned to--

169
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,213
You were very meticulous
for someone who didn't plan to hide it.

170
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,301
Okay, fine.
I intentionally hid it from you.

171
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,596
But back then, I didn't know
that I'd end up liking you.

172
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,641
You never planned on liking me?

173
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,393
Well, I did. But I didn't know
I'd end up liking you this much.

174
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,395
"This much"? How much is that?

175
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,480
A lot.

176
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,735
What are you doing right now?

177
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,284
I'm sorry

178
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,037
I didn't tell you that I know.

179
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,917
I'm sorry I deceived you.

180
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,090
Anyway, when did you find out?

181
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,345
Right before we went to see Mr. Roh Seok.

182
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,429
How?

183
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,560
I had a whole bunch
of circumstantial evidence,

184
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,938
but this sealed the deal.

185
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,314
ARE YOU AN ANGEL? DON'T FLY AWAY

186
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,691
Your handwriting.

187
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,863
Weren't you surprised?

188
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,991
A little bit.

189
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,450
Weren't you angry?

190
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,411
A little bit.

191
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,125
Didn't it put you off?

192
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,212
You could've thought I was weird.

193
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,215
Not at all.

194
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,138
I was a little surprised
and slightly angry,

195
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,764
but it didn't make me dislike you.

196
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,184
It made me know you better.

197
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,608
Why don't we properly introduce
each other then,

198
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,027
The Road to Si-an?

199
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,945
Hi, I'm The Road to Si-an.

200
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,780
I apologize for sitting on top of you

201
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,741
and ripping your jacket at the airport.

202
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,288
Do you know this though?

203
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,041
You fell down at the airport

204
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,836
because I pushed you.

205
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,050
I apologize too.

206
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,596
Have we come clean
with all our secrets then?

207
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,389
Yes.

208
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,526
What is it?

209
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,329
Latte?

210
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,373
You're Latte?

211
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,085
-Hey! How could you?
-Hold on.

212
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,419
You fraud!

213
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,755
-You're Latte?
-The Road to Si-an, please.

214
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,298
The Road to Si-an? No, Ms. Sung, please.

215
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,299
-Ms. Sung, wait.
-Latte.

216
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,842
-Hold on a second.
-You!

217
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,761
Wait.

218
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,429
Why did you join my fanpage?

219
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,099
I just wanted to know more about you.

220
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,184
So what did you dig up about me?

221
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,227
Well...

222
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,480
I found out that you think
Cha Si-an's thighs are amazing.

223
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,731
My gosh!

224
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,984
-His collarbone takes your breath away.
-Stop.

225
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,945
Stop it. I'm serious.

226
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,741
Let go.

227
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,993
Let go while I ask nicely.

228
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,496
Unbelievable.

229
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,414
Teach me too.

230
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,166
Teach you what?

231
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,381
-How to be a fanboy.
-Fanboying?

232
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,637
You're so cute when you're fangirling,

233
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,391
so I want to be your fanboy too.

234
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,853
I'll be "The Road to Duk-mi."

235
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,064
Fanboying isn't easy, you know.

236
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,399
Is that so?

237
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,318
Fanboys and fangirls

238
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,072
are satisfied just by looking
at their stars from a distance.

239
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,242
There's no touching or holding involved.

240
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,244
Why not?

241
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,788
Because just looking at the person
brings you happiness.

242
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,666
That's the rule.

243
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,503
I should stick to gazes too then.

244
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,006
Would that be enough?

245
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,433
Just like this, you're happy
just watching the other person.

246
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,435
It brings you joy.

247
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,440
Just gazing at me should excite...

248
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,694
-Why are you unbuttoning your shirt?
-It's hot in here.

249
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,532
You wish the best for the other person

250
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,242
and like to see them laugh.

251
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,830
-Why the watch?
-My wrist hurts.

252
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,879
Anyway, Si-an is...

253
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,431
You're too pretty for your own good.

254
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,148
I thought I was just supposed to look.

255
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,610
Go ahead and leave the rest to me.

256
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,638
Maybe it's Cha Si-an again.

257
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,692
Ms. Kim Hyo-jin?

258
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,778
Kim Hyo-jin?

259
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,196
As in Sindy?

260
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,001
What brings you here unannounced?

261
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,546
Director Gold, between you
and my mom, who'd win?

262
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,590
-What?
-Can you overturn her decision?

263
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,176
Hyo-jin, you're not making any sense.

264
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,846
My mom is against Si-an participating
in the exhibition!

265
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,682
Why would she be against it?

266
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
Seriously?

267
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,446
Why do your clothes always get wet
at other people's homes?

268
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,739
It creates misunderstandings.

269
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,074
Oh, well...

270
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,827
I have hand tremors.

271
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,747
Hyo-jin, please get to the point.

272
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,833
Keep it simple and stay calm.

273
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,502
So...

274
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:44,237
Mom, you've got this all wrong.

275
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,121
Hyo-jin?

276
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,458
-I'm off to the museum.
-Did you

277
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,462
see the preview of the documentary show,

278
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,671
The Chaser K?

279
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,590
The episode title

280
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,220
is The Twisted Love of Fanatics.

281
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,766
An obsessed fan and stalker Sindy

282
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,936
bought a limited edition luxury item.

283
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,981
When I saw the preview,

284
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,858
I got a hunch right way,

285
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,735
so I did some digging.

286
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,906
It turns out that this stalker
is actually my daughter.

287
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,326
-It's not me.
-It's not you?

288
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,621
My husband was on the news

289
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,873
and my daughter will be
on a documentary show.

290
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,626
My husband is an economic offender

291
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,046
while my daughter is a celebrity stalker.

292
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,549
-Mom.
-Seriously?

293
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,801
I'm already sick and tired

294
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,888
of hearing rumors
about your father's love child,

295
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,766
and now my daughter is a stalker?

296
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,644
I just hate this!

297
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,813
I hate it!

298
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,858
"No K-pop idol singer
will ever participate

299
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,777
in an exhibition held at my museum."

300
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,612
That's what she said.

301
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,990
The documentary is ruining many lives.

302
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,408
Your mother

303
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,286
has no authority at Cheum Museum.

304
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,537
Got it?

305
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,583
-If that's all, please--
-Not when she is

306
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,710
the head director
of TK Cultural Foundation?

307
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,463
My mom will be its head director soon,

308
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,091
which means she'll have a say
in the museum's operations.

309
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,142
Can you still overturn her decision?

310
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,522
I really want to make the merchandise
for Si-an's exhibition.

311
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,440
Me too.

312
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,364
I'll think of a solution for this,

313
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,866
so please leave now.

314
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,165
Director Gold,

315
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,127
I've never said anything like this before,

316
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,545
so it feels very awkward.

317
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,174
But can I borrow some money?

318
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,848
If you got kicked out of the house
and took a cab without any money,

319
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,850
you should've borrowed money
for the fare first.

320
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,435
The meter runs while the taxi waits.

321
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,645
I'll pay him back.

322
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,813
That's not the issue.

323
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,483
You're going back home, right?

324
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,863
How much is it a night at a sauna?

325
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,240
I hear you can sleep there.

326
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,532
You should head home.

327
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,662
-Ms. Kim.
-I have to keep my pride.

328
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm not returning for at least a week.

329
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,749
No, three days.

330
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,794
I'm not going home until then.

331
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,304
Director, I'll take her with me.

332
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,681
Why are you leaving too?

333
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,891
She's a naive girl
who knows nothing but fangirling,

334
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,268
and I can't just leave her alone.

335
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,728
I can't let her sleep at a sauna either.

336
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,480
Then let's send her to a hotel.

337
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,857
Don't go, Duk-mi.

338
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,901
I'll take her with me.

339
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,198
Where will you take her? To your home?

340
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,616
No way.

341
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,581
Why aren't you coming?

342
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,334
Can't I just go sleep at a hotel?

343
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,337
Ms. Kim.

344
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,922
You have two options.

345
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,216
Number one, my home,
number two, the streets.

346
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,305
It's better than sleeping
on the street, right? Follow me.

347
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,225
Oh right. There's one thing
you need to remember.

348
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,979
In my home,
you shouldn't mention idol stars. Okay?

349
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,733
Is this some kind of trend
among moms lately?

350
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,110
Let's go.

351
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,536
-Hey.
-Mom, I'm home.

352
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,038
Welcome.

353
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,582
I heard you're Duk-mi's colleague.

354
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,668
Oh my, you're very pretty.

355
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,628
Hello, ma'am.

356
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,175
You might not have noticed,
but say hello to him too.

357
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,468
He's Duk-mi's dad.

358
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,181
Hello, sir.

359
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,142
Make yourself at home.

360
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:25,894
Have a seat.

361
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,980
Why are you dressed like that?

362
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,317
What? It's a boyfriend look.
It's trendy these days.

363
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,527
What man will like you
if you're dressed like that?

364
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,904
This is why you can't date.

365
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,947
What? Ms. Sung is...

366
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,868
I have to meet someone who'll like me
even when I'm dressed like this.

367
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,370
Unbelievable.

368
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,871
Have a seat right there.

369
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,001
-Is the rice well-cooked?
-Of course.

370
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,753
Here.

371
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,092
We don't even need side dishes.

372
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,468
It's perfect.

373
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,184
-Duk-mi.
-What?

374
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,145
Call Eun-gi and tell him
you're sleeping here tonight.

375
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,730
Okay.

376
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,621
Eun-gi?

377
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,706
I'm at Mom's house right now.

378
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,584
I'm going to sleep here
with my colleague tonight.

379
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,587
So just sleep inside your tent
at the studio.

380
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,799
Did you call me to tell me that?

381
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,800
Yes.

382
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,762
I'll go there now, so meet me
at the playground outside.

383
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,098
Eun-gi. Eun-gi?

384
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,479
You can sleep in this.

385
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,399
You're staying for one night.
Go home tomorrow.

386
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,609
Will we sleep in here together?

387
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,529
Then why don't you go
to your big room and sleep alone?

388
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,993
You can stay here alone, right?
I'll go out for a while.

389
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,704
-Where are you going?
-Is this still CUPATCH or what?

390
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,207
You can go to sleep first.

391
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,272
Hey, Eun-gi.

392
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,693
I have a guest at home right now.
Why did you call me out?

393
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,113
What is it you have to say?
Hurry up and tell me.

394
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,406
Have a seat.

395
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,211
Duk-mi.

396
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,215
-This morning--
-Did Seon-ju go home safely?

397
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,842
Did she make up with Seung-min?
I can't reach her.

398
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,719
-Should I call her again?
-Duk-mi.

399
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,845
Yes?

400
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,306
This morning...

401
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,685
You heard me saying
that I like you, right?

402
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,855
Did that happen?

403
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,108
I know you just did that
in order to help me.

404
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,028
-You're so cute sometimes.
-Don't act like it's a joke.

405
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,535
Right now, you are

406
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,914
not family nor a friend to me.

407
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,001
You're a woman.

408
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,888
I like you, Duk-mi.

409
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,984
Look at your face.

410
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,331
Eun-gi.

411
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,417
I...

412
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,711
like Director Gold.

413
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,424
-Director Gold and I are--
-I know.

414
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,721
I know you're seeing him.

415
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,228
But I can't just give up
without a fair fight as a judo player.

416
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,489
I'm not asking you to look at me
as a man right away.

417
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,659
No matter how long it takes,

418
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,662
I can wait.

419
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,667
Go back in. And goodnight.

420
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,108
What is it?
Are you having trouble sleeping?

421
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,278
Yes. Aren't you going to bed?

422
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,156
I have trouble sleeping too.

423
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,661
Why don't you come here for a second?

424
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,459
Let's see.

425
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,089
Is this a bit too large?

426
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,885
If you're having trouble sleeping,

427
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,513
can you wind this thread for me?

428
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,227
Who is it for?

429
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,897
I'm just knitting it. It's like a habit.

430
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,192
Duk-mi only wore knitted clothing
when she was little,

431
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,819
so she never wears them now.

432
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,197
It's not as pretty as the clothing
they make these days anyway.

433
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,366
It's pretty though.

434
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,869
Really? Do you really think so?

435
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,121
Yes.

436
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,499
Then I'll give you this
when I'm finished knitting.

437
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,502
Oh, I didn't mean that I wanted it.

438
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,796
I see.

439
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,297
No, I mean,

440
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,094
how much does it cost to make this?
Including material and labor costs.

441
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,139
Five big ones.

442
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,769
Thank you very much, ma'am.

443
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,315
"Thank you very much, ma'am."

444
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,903
You fought with your mom, right?

445
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,448
Since you ran away from home
after fighting with your mom,

446
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,949
I'll let you stay for one night.

447
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,493
You should go home tomorrow.
Your mom will be worried.

448
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,121
My mom won't be worried about me.

449
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,289
Really?

450
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,292
Don't go home then.

451
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,296
I'll let you stay in Duk-mi's room,
so live here from now on.

452
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,470
You can't do that?
Because you're worried about your mom?

453
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,561
Why isn't Duk-mi coming back?

454
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,332
Right now, you are not
family nor a friend to me.

455
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,292
You're a woman.

456
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,969
I like you, Duk-mi.

457
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,192
Hey, Director Gold.

458
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,612
Just a second. Let me go outside and talk.

459
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,157
Hyo-jin's sleeping next to me right now.

460
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,083
-Director Gold.
-Yes?

461
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,549
Never mind.

462
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,384
You sound a little upset.

463
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,678
Is there something wrong?

464
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,555
By any chance,

465
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,807
is it because of Mr. Nam?

466
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,393
-How did you know?
-Don't you know already?

467
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,687
I have you in the palm of my hand.

468
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,530
To be honest,

469
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,241
Eun-gi told me

470
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,910
that he likes me.

471
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,746
Yes, I know that.

472
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,456
I heard him say it this morning.

473
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,128
Are you trying to make me jealous
by telling me that again?

474
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm telling you because we promised
not to keep secrets from each other.

475
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,722
Thank you for telling me.

476
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,727
And don't make any hasty decisions.

477
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,857
Mr. Nam is your precious family.

478
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,945
I know you're not getting swayed by him.

479
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,366
Still, that doesn't mean

480
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,620
I won't be jealous at all, so don't be

481
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,038
so sure of it.

482
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,290
Okay.

483
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,710
By the way, did Hyo-jin cause any trouble?

484
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,714
Come to think of it,
there are two fangirls in that house.

485
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,507
Didn't that startle your mother?

486
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,637
Hyo-jin will get kicked out of here too
if my mom finds out.

487
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,765
My mom hates fangirling.

488
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,517
Oh, really?

489
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,436
What am I sensing right now?

490
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,521
I decided to make sure

491
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,815
that my girlfriend doesn't get caught

492
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,400
fangirling.

493
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,569
No, that's not what it sounded like.

494
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,364
You're teasing me, aren't you?

495
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,660
You acted like you understood,
but you're teasing me, aren't you?

496
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,808
Seon-ju.

497
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,982
I tried not to go
with that subject at first

498
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,609
because I knew you and Duk-mi
would hate it.

499
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,447
But my senior promised
to send me any team I'd like

500
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,949
once I did that.

501
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,413
And I thought I'd be able to keep the show
as neutral as possible.

502
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,789
You also wanted me

503
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,667
to quit working on current affairs
and go to a variety show team,

504
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,335
didn't you?

505
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,630
Did you force yourself to do it

506
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,841
because of me?

507
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,012
Did you do it for my sake
when you didn't want to do variety shows

508
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,516
and stay with the current affairs?

509
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,019
No, that's not what I meant.

510
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,733
Do you know
what I really hate about you right now?

511
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,193
If you've hurt me,

512
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,863
you should just remain as the assailant.

513
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,615
Why are you using me
as an excuse to act like a victim?

514
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,785
Do you expect me

515
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,704
to understand and pity you

516
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,789
in this situation?

517
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,460
I should've just told you from the start.

518
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,046
I shouldn't have stalled.

519
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,675
I don't know why I did that.

520
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,429
Shall I tell you

521
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,515
why you didn't tell me beforehand?

522
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,478
It's because you didn't feel the need to.

523
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,648
You knew I'd throw a fit
once I found out later on,

524
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,109
but you could simply escape that moment.

525
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,738
You probably thought a married woman
who also has a kid

526
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,990
won't be able to get a divorce
just because of that.

527
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,162
That's why you didn't tell me.

528
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,289
You already had it all in your head.

529
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,294
You used

530
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,340
my precious family as a weapon to stab me

531
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,260
and used Geon-u as a shield
to hide behind him.

532
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,223
It was a nasty and cowardly move.

533
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,350
Seon-ju.

534
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,147
Seon-ju, where are you going?

535
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,317
Where would I go?

536
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,779
I should go home.

537
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,602
Here's the accommodation fee.

538
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,646
The accommodation fee? What is it?

539
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,065
The original copies of CUPATCH.

540
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,610
Gosh, I don't take photos
of you guys anymore.

541
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,156
It's more like a collection
of your memories as a couple now.

542
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,074
And

543
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,619
I am very sorry, ma'am.

544
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,161
What is it now?

545
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,246
Take a look at this.

546
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,082
Hey, that's...

547
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,793
This is it, right?

548
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,631
Ms. Sung, can you come here
and take a look?

549
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,220
What is it?

550
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,736
Where did you find this?

551
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,822
Yu-seop found it
on an art investment website.

552
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,991
It's a private collection
that got uploaded a year ago.

553
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,537
It's not exactly in its best condition,
but I could tell that it's Lee Sol's work.

554
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,539
Did you call the collector?

555
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,999
Yes, I did.
He doesn't have it with him now,

556
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,294
but he's keeping it at a gallery,
so I was just about to go and check.

557
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,629
I'll go with you.

558
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,174
Director Gold and I are going

559
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,801
-to go to the gallery.
-Okay.

560
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,056
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

561
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,308
Great job. Thank you.

562
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,605
See you.

563
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,275
Did you guys hear that?

564
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,485
He just thanked me.

565
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,945
We must've grown on him.

566
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,250
Is this where you keep Lee Sol's painting?

567
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,752
Not all paintings are stored like this.

568
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,797
This is where we keep severely damaged
artwork or ones that aren't worth selling

569
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,008
right before they get discarded.

570
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,343
Is this the one?

571
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,886
Let me check.

572
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,601
-Director.
-Oh, yes.

573
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:54,214
It's in such a bad condition
that I feel bad about selling it.

574
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,842
Please send it to Cheum Museum of Art.

575
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,010
Okay.

576
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,476
Director Gold.

577
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,630
Director Gold.

578
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,969
I'll ask Professor Yang
to do the restoration.

579
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,054
Sure.

580
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,390
Director Gold.

581
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,184
Hold on. There's something I need to buy.

582
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,853
Can you wait for me over there?

583
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,438
-Should I come with you?
-No.

584
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,689
Just wait for me.

585
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,030
Gosh, why are you better than me at this?

586
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,075
-Come on. Try harder.
-I made it turn.

587
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,994
Isn't it hilarious?

588
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,289
Can I get two of what they're having?

589
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,465
Were you thirsty?

590
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,060
What exactly are you doing?

591
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,270
It's a pinwheel.

592
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,733
You're pretty when you laugh.

593
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,696
Director Gold,

594
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,742
Professor Yang is
the best restorer in Korea.

595
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,702
I'm sure that Lee Sol's painting

596
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,871
will be well-restored and sent our way,

597
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,164
so don't worry.

598
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,416
I'm sorry

599
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,587
for brooding about this
and wallowing in my sorrows.

600
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,464
It's all right.

601
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:45,010
I felt terrible seeing all that artwork
stacked in there.

602
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,640
They must have meant a lot
to somebody once,

603
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,142
but now they're just sitting there.

604
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,064
Let's never end up

605
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,359
like those paintings.

606
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,740
We'll gaze at, adore,
and take interest in each other.

607
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,200
What do you say?

608
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,842
The weather's great.

609
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,928
How's the drink?

610
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,369
That's the general mood of the song.

611
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,787
-I quite like that.
-Great.

612
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,582
-It'll go well with this.
-And this too.

613
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,752
Yes, Director Gold.

614
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,171
Sure, I'll tell Si-an.

615
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,299
Thanks.

616
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,509
Was that Ryan?

617
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,510
Yes.

618
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,262
He found another piece

619
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,598
of Lee Sol's artwork.

620
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,765
Really?

621
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,268
I should ask him about it when I get home.

622
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,021
Don't pester him.
He'll probably be with his girlfriend.

623
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,732
He's such a lucky guy.

624
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,942
He gets to be with his girlfriend all day.

625
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,529
You'll give Ms. Choi the wrong idea.

626
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,949
I just think she comes by often.

627
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,828
-I see.
-You saw them the other day.

628
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,956
They were making out
in the elevator in broad daylight.

629
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,125
I'm not kidding.

630
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,253
This seems like the way to go.

631
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,079
Ryan, can I see
Lee Sol's painting tomorrow?

632
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,539
It was actually quite damaged,

633
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,500
so it needs to be restored first.

634
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,459
Damaged?

635
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,211
To what extent?

636
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,421
I'm meeting an expert restorer tomorrow,

637
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,006
so I'll let you know once I find out.

638
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,466
Oh, okay.

639
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,304
Ms. Sung said

640
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,349
that this restorer is the best in Korea,

641
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,267
so there's no need to worry.

642
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,228
Right.

643
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,480
I just really want to see it.

644
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,817
All nine of Lee Sol's paintings
in one place.

645
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,156
Did the person who bought it agree
to lend it for the exhibition?

646
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,327
Yes, it'll arrive at the museum soon.

647
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,746
I can't wait to see it.

648
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,336
Would you like some fried chicken?

649
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,881
If not, then...

650
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,883
Say that a little less formally.

651
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,677
"Want some fried chicken?"

652
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,346
"Want some fried chicken?"

653
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,391
See? Isn't it nice to just speak casually?

654
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,643
Order boneless chicken this time.

655
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:34,406
Professor, can it be restored
before the exhibition?

656
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,786
I'll make sure that it is.

657
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,165
Don't worry.
It's in better shape than it seems.

658
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,791
Have it sent to my lab.

659
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:45,876
Sure.

660
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,420
I thank you in advance, Professor.

661
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,645
Take care, sir.

662
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,938
You too.

663
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,460
Director Gold,
what are you doing after work today?

664
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,753
Is there anything you want to do?

665
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,797
Actually, I'm cleaning my house today.

666
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,926
-Then--
-My boyfriend's coming over.

667
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,970
-What?
-I'll see you at the penthouse after work.

668
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,640
Take your time getting there though.

669
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,317
He already knows,
so I'll make it official.

670
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,799
Is this too much though?

671
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,468
Let's get rid of a few then.

672
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,931
Duk-mi, don't. Just own it.

673
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,975
He already knows you're a fangirl.

674
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,893
Maybe

675
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,062
I'll just get rid of one.

676
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,647
All right.

677
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,626
Si-an, forgive me.

678
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:21,239
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN
IN THE UNIVERSE, CHA SI-AN

679
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,700
Goodness.

680
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,747
Why is the door open?

681
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,046
You're here already?

682
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,175
Mom?

683
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,640
So this is why you moved out
preaching to be

684
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,849
this era's independent woman.

685
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,768
Mom, that's not it.

686
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:56,024
What did I say I'd do
if I caught you fangirling again?

687
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,944
Mom, relax. Calm down and listen to me.

688
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,987
The thing is, this room...

689
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,781
-Mom!
-You little...

690
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
Where are the scissors?

691
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,617
-I'm going to shave off...
-Mom.

692
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,452
your head and that idol's head as well.

693
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,329
Mom, I don't have scissors at home.

694
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,133
That hurts. Stop!

695
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,057
-Gosh, Mom!
-I'm not your mom.

696
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,517
I refuse to be your mom!

697
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,936
Why are you hitting me
if you're not even my mom?

698
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,145
Not even your mom?

699
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,730
You little...

700
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,691
Say that again, you little brat!

701
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,615
Director Gold?

702
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:46,866
Hello.

703
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:59,170
Goodness, you should've told me
that you were expecting a guest.

704
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:05,260
What brings you here, Director Gold?

705
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,264
-There's this thing with the museum.
-Duk-mi and I are seeing each other.

706
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,561
You're in a relationship?

707
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,272
-With Duk-mi?
-Yes.

708
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,024
It hasn't been long since we've gone out.

709
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,488
Duk-mi's apartment
looks like this because...

710
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,951
It's all mine.

711
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,038
I like that young man over there.

712
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,998
But Duk-mi's dad doesn't like it.

713
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,791
So I brought all my stuff here.

714
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,084
You must've been surprised.

715
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,420
Mom.

716
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,922
Director Gold already knows
that I like an idol star.

717
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,716
He knows?

718
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,888
You know that she's like this?

719
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,723
Yes.

720
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,683
Yet you still like her?

721
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,393
Yes.

722
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,525
Whenever I saw her fangirling,

723
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,652
she looked so passionate

724
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,030
that I started to like her.

725
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,656
My gosh.

726
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,658
See, I told you.

727
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,495
It's not like I couldn't date
because of my fangirling.

728
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,871
I could've done it if I wanted to.

729
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,083
Do you think I stopped you
from fangirling because of that?

730
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,918
It's because you came home injured
all the time.

731
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,004
Did you hear about when she came home

732
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,798
with a broken arm during high school?

733
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,467
Yes. I heard she studied
for another year because of that.

734
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,802
-Here's what happened.
-Mom.

735
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,055
She went to an idol singer's concert
and broke her arm.

736
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,766
I'm grateful
that you understand my daughter,

737
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,976
but I hope she won't get hurt.

738
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,020
That will never happen.

739
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,606
I'll protect her.

740
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:47,987
Then,

741
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,200
-I hope you and Duk-mi--
-Let me show my mom out.

742
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,828
Mom, you must be tired
after such a long day. Let's go.

743
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,496
-No, but...
-You should go home and rest.

744
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,498
Grab your bag. Okay.

745
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,999
Let's go.

746
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,807
You!

747
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,518
I know. It's all my fault.

748
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,104
Don't come home
with a broken arm ever again.

749
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,148
I'll really shave off your head.

750
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,733
And try to clean up more neatly in there.

751
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,694
If it's difficult, call me.

752
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,780
-Mom.
-Goodness, get off me.

753
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,032
Mom, you know that I love you, right?

754
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:34,826
Save it!

755
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,536
Go back inside.

756
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,413
Mom.

757
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,749
Go back inside!

758
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,694
It's much different
from how you imagined, right?

759
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:11,946
Yes.

760
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,533
So,

761
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,162
do you feel uncomfortable?

762
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,122
Yes.

763
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,836
All you did was draw my caricature
on a piece of paper.

764
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,922
What is this portrait?

765
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,799
Also,

766
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,719
the flowers I gave you.

767
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,055
Why are the flowers I gave you in here?

768
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,932
You could've placed it right here
in the center.

769
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,350
You could've taken all this stuff out.

770
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,809
You even wrote, "Lion."

771
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,770
This place is full of Cha Si-an's stuff.

772
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,982
Are you jealous of Si-an right now?

773
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,778
Jealous? For goodness sake, please.

774
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,243
-What was that?
-I'm stopping you from talking

775
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,619
since you're so cute.

776
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,210
What is that water bottle?

777
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,671
That's from April 3, 2019.

778
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,631
I received it at the Snapshot showcase.

779
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,341
Did Si-an hand out water bottles?

780
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,425
No.

781
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,720
He aimed accurately so I could receive it

782
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,639
and threw it to me from the stage.

783
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,726
What is that paper?

784
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,770
That's the confetti from the stage.

785
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,855
You can feel the excitement
of the concert.

786
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,274
I see.

787
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,234
It's a great color combination.

788
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,071
Shall we move on
to the exhibition number two?

789
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,366
This exhibition consists
of various fan art pieces.

790
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,745
Did you express
Cha Si-an's inner beauty through these?

791
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,248
-Portraits of Extreme Realism?
-No.

792
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,333
Si-an's beauty is too unrealistic,

793
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,460
so it's impossible to express it
through a drawing.

794
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,506
Also,

795
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,926
this is Kong.

796
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,721
I participated in his fan signing event
just by buying one album

797
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,473
and even received this rare gift
by winning a lucky draw.

798
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,063
I feel so happy
after admitting that I'm a fangirl.

799
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,609
-But Duk-mi...
-Yes?

800
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,572
-There's one thing that bothers me.
-What is it?

801
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,118
It feels like
we're not the only ones here.

802
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,006
But it's cold outside.
I can't just throw it out.

803
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,675
-What's wrong with his neck?
-His neck?

804
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,804
That brute Eun-gi chopped his head off.

805
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,527
SUNG DUK-MI

806
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,820
Goodnight.

807
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,877
Mom.

808
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,514
Let go!

809
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,474
I'm not your mom.

810
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,110
-Hello?
-Were you asleep?

811
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,239
No, I wasn't sleeping.

812
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,786
It's too early to be sleeping.

813
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,416
Why didn't you go to bed yet?

814
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,461
Oh, I was working.

815
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,463
Until now?

816
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,508
You should've ordered me instead.

817
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,137
-My chief curator is a bit...
-A bit what?

818
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,890
A bit too talented to order around.

819
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,146
Are you having trouble sleeping?

820
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,070
You should go to sleep.
Don't turn on the lights.

821
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,035
Where are you right now?

822
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,062
Director Gold, I'll be right down.
Just a second.

823
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,288
Did you really come all the way here
to see me?

824
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,457
Gosh, I feel like I won the lottery.

825
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,128
Didn't you say fangirls aren't lucky?

826
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,379
Exactly.

827
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,181
I saw you, so I should go back now.

828
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,275
You came here literally just to see me?

829
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,528
I'm all recharged now.

830
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:11,073
I'm sorry for waking you up.
You should go back inside.

831
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,009
Duk-mi?

832
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:49,862
It's okay.

833
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,285
We promised not to

834
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,746
keep secrets from each other.

835
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,667
So,

836
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,420
it's okay

837
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,548
for you to cry.

838
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,970
I will spend time with you all night.

839
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,556
I think I got scammed yesterday.

840
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,516
The Celebrity Collectors' Exhibition.

841
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,894
I want you to cancel it.

842
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,689
I was able to get everything I wanted.

843
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,942
I feel like there's only one thing
I can do at this point.

844
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,694
I'm glad I came.

845
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,113
Now that I made happy memories
with someone I like,

846
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,616
I don't hate that place
as much as I used to.

847
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,451
Hi, Heo Yun-jae.

848
