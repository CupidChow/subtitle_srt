1
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,394
Mom! Duk-mi is scribbling
on the ground again.

2
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,482
I wasn't scribbling. I was drawing.

3
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,400
To me, they look like scribbles.

4
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,444
I'm just stating what I see.

5
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,571
Hey!

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,449
Mom.

7
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,619
Duk-mi. I told you not to hit Eun-gi.

8
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,929
I told you you'd get in trouble
if you scribbled again.

9
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,764
I told you, they're not scribbles.

10
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,058
Duk-mi. What are you going to become--

11
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,060
What are you going to become
when you grow up?

12
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,312
An artist that draws paintings.

13
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,190
I'm going to hang up my paintings
in a huge gallery.

14
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,280
Hey, stop that!

15
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,657
-Hey.
-Stop.

16
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,700
-Hey!
-I said, stop.

17
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,913
Stop it!

18
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,974
Did you have sweet dreams?

19
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,144
They were sweet
because they were my memories.

20
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,024
However, they were a bit sad too.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,903
I played with you, Eun-gi,

22
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,614
and Duk-su.

23
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,710
What were you doing up?

24
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,298
I was drawing.

25
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,051
A drawing of you sleeping.

26
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,762
Do I look pretty in it?

27
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,975
You're a woman that is out of this world,

28
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,895
so it's hard to express your beauty
through a drawing.

29
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,903
In my dream,

30
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,739
I drew with you.

31
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,618
We used chalk
and drew a lot of things, here and there.

32
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,498
But Eun-gi said I was scribbling,
and said he'd tell Mom.

33
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,083
So I told him that

34
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,001
I'll become an artist later

35
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,462
and that my paintings would be
hung up in a gallery.

36
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,881
Although

37
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,384
I failed to become an artist,

38
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,011
at least I became a person
who hangs up paintings at a gallery.

39
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,770
Nowadays, we don't

40
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,358
go to an exhibition and see
a piece of art directly.

41
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,902
What we see

42
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,322
is a concept of what a curator
perceives as art.

43
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,490
Simply put,

44
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,203
a true artist is not the maker,
but the curator.

45
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,497
Everything depends on
the curator's choice.

46
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,332
Slavoj Zizek?

47
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,961
I totally agree with him.

48
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,171
A curator is an artist, too.

49
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,633
I can even draw again.

50
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
Thanks to you, Curator Sung Duk-mi.

51
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,015
The exhibition room is my canvas.

52
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,894
However...

53
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,981
Right now,

54
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,693
your face seems like my canvas.

55
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,156
Can I draw on it?

56
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,075
With what?

57
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,790
I'm suddenly feeling very creative.

58
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,418
How shall I draw on it?

59
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,212
Shall I begin?

60
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,930
All right, shall we begin drawing
on our canvas?

61
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,390
What? Canvas?

62
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,435
Let's go see Mr. No's collection first.

63
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,270
-Yes!
-Okay.

64
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,198
I HOPE I BECOME A PART OF YOUR DREAM

65
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,824
-Did you check everything?
-Yes.

66
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,117
Okay.

67
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,912
Always leave it on channel number two.

68
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,330
Make sure you keep it that way.

69
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,707
Okay, let's take a look
at the microphones.

70
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,584
Always check if it works properly.

71
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,212
It's working.

72
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,505
Do, mi, sol

73
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,840
Welcome to the fifth-anniversary
exhibition of Cheum Museum.

74
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,176
-Will this do?
-Move it a little bit to the right.

75
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,636
Okay. Is this okay?

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,971
It's crooked. The right side
needs to come down a little more.

77
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,225
-Hyo-jin, please hurry.
-Okay, I'm done.

78
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,684
Okay, there we go.

79
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,771
-Nice.
-It looks great.

80
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,773
-You hung it nicely.
-I know.

81
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,674
CHEUM'S FIFTH-ANNIVERSARY EXHIBITION
GALLERY LAYOUT

82
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,809
-Let's turn on the projector.
-Okay.

83
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,812
-You've checked the focus, right?
-Yes.

84
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,606
If the lighting's dark,
it'll be brighter, right?

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,774
Yes.

86
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,163
"The Room, The Life," Cheum Museum's
fifth-anniversary exhibition.

87
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,789
We're finally holding the exhibition.

88
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,959
Hyo-jin, this is your first exhibition.
How do you feel?

89
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,170
I'm excited.

90
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,047
It feels as if I'm getting to meet
someone from my imagination.

91
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,426
It was really hard work,
but I'm still really excited.

92
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,263
Are you sure it's not because
you get to meet Mr. Cha?

93
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,681
You caught me.

94
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,643
By the way, Director Gold.

95
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,979
How did you come up
with the title of the exhibition?

96
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,357
I came up with it
after I saw someone's room.

97
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,735
How did that room look?

98
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,321
The room was filled

99
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,282
with cheerful, fun, and happy things.

100
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,794
Fill your room with the things you love

101
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,590
so you can live a happier life.

102
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,180
We're the first ones here.

103
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,348
We're the first in line.

104
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,226
I can't wait for the museum to open.

105
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,937
What do you think will be there?
Photos of Si-an?

106
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,233
Si-an, can you please face the front?

107
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,901
-Great.
-Please look over here.

108
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,486
-Thank you.
-Please look here, too.

109
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,695
-Great.
-Over here.

110
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,489
-How do you feel?
-Can you wave your hand for us?

111
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,740
Okay, great.

112
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,825
-Nice.
-Please look over here.

113
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,787
-Over here.
-Okay, great.

114
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,038
You're doing great.

115
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,998
-Please stand by the wall.
-Okay.

116
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,709
Okay, great.

117
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,255
Hyo-jin.

118
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,299
Is that sculpture over there

119
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,552
part of the exhibition?

120
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,887
Si-an really looks
like a sculpture, doesn't he?

121
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,306
He's so good-looking.

122
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,642
Mr. Kim, chop-chop.

123
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,201
Hyo-jin.

124
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,037
Didn't you design that?

125
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,085
-Mom.
-Yes?

126
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,089
I can die right now with no regrets.

127
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,634
No. Hyo-jin, you can't die.
Don't say something so horrible.

128
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,846
Hyo-jin, I'm so proud of you.

129
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,962
Art may be great,

130
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,590
but it can't be greater
than a living human being.

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,844
Regardless of how insignificant
I may seem,

132
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,264
I'm still greater than
those condescending paintings

133
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,932
that are hung on that wall.

134
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,270
Because I'm a living being,
and I will continue to live.

135
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,784
These eyes aren't the eyes
of a sad farewell

136
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,203
or one's eyes waiting for death.

137
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,914
He's looking at someone he loves.

138
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,041
He wanted to leave this for that person.

139
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,751
He was looking at this person,

140
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,837
and his eyes were greeting that person.

141
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,632
"Hello, I'm here.

142
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,469
I'm always here looking at you like this."

143
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,808
Hi.

144
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,105
HELLO

145
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,243
Soap bubbles,

146
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,079
a rocking horse, a Ferris wheel,
and a pirate ship ride.

147
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,666
They're all things
that children especially enjoy.

148
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,960
I think I know
what the artist was thinking

149
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,295
when she drew these paintings.

150
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,339
We're both

151
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,678
smiling.

152
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,851
We look very happy.

153
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,659
FILL YOUR ROOM WITH THE THINGS YOU LOVE

154
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,495
SO YOU CAN LIVE A HAPPIER LIFE

155
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,197
Congratulations, Mom,

156
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,282
on your first exhibition.

157
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,117
Thank you, Si-an.

158
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,830
You too, Yun-jae.

159
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,083
Thank you, Ms. Lee Sol.

160
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,295
Thank you for letting us exhibit
your amazing paintings.

161
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,592
Thank you, Ms. Sung.

162
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,885
Congratulations.

163
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,062
Would you like me
to take a photo of you guys?

164
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,106
Let's take a photo.

165
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,277
Duk-mi is a great photographer.

166
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,967
Would you like to order?

167
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,094
-I want an iced--
-An iced Americano

168
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,929
and a latte with condensed milk
with no espresso.

169
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,348
You leave out the espresso?

170
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,350
I can't drink coffee

171
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,811
because I take after someone.

172
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,897
Then I'll have the same thing.

173
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,024
A latte with condensed milk
with no espresso.

174
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,193
Mr. Cha, what would you like?

175
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,905
I'll have what Ms. Sung is having.
An iced Americano.

176
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,951
Two lattes with condensed milk
with no espresso,

177
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,286
one iced Americano,

178
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,747
and one exquisitely delicious
iced Americano.

179
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,165
I'll bring them to you soon.

180
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,473
Mom, I didn't know
you couldn't drink coffee.

181
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,185
Ms. Lee, I thought I was your favorite.

182
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,187
-Ju-hyeok.
-Yes?

183
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,440
Once a fangirl, always a fangirl.

184
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,444
You may be my favorite,
but Si-an is on a different level.

185
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,072
She must not be very interested.

186
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,660
-That's a first.
-Ms. Lee.

187
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,996
Yes, Mr. Cha?

188
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,416
What's this music?
I've never heard of it before.

189
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,376
It's nice, right?

190
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,338
There's a band named Fade, and

191
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,174
he's the lead singer and guitarist
of that band.

192
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,759
His name is Ju-hyeok.

193
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,011
They're going to make an album soon.

194
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,305
"Fade"?

195
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,934
That's great. I'll look forward
to your album.

196
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,854
When the album gets released,
I'll give it to you as a gift

197
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,273
in person.

198
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,651
Okay.

199
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,325
Ju-hyeok, can you please pinch me?

200
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:05,130
CHOIKANG JUDO

201
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,058
-We should head inside first.
-Sure.

202
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,948
Hello, I'm Yun-jae's mother.

203
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,370
After hearing you'd be here,

204
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,373
I stayed up all night

205
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,834
thinking about what I should say to you.

206
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,128
Then I realized I have nothing to say,

207
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,839
except that I'm sorry.

208
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,384
Yun-jae told me everything.

209
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,762
Even if it was only for a short time,

210
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,099
I'm grateful that you looked after him.

211
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,309
SUNG DUK-SU

212
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,771
So this is where you were, Duk-su.

213
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,278
When you were young, I once brought you,

214
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,239
Eun-gi, and Duk-su here to visit.

215
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,118
After seeing a monk, Duk-su couldn't

216
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,120
contain his laughter.

217
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,790
He kept on yelling, "It's a baldy."

218
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,002
You can imagine how embarrassing it was.

219
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,173
That's why I brought him here

220
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,883
so that he could have
laughter in his life.

221
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,055
Then I'll be the one
who brings you laughter.

222
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,480
I have something for you.

223
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,830
I can tell by looking at these photos

224
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,042
how kind and generous you were to my son.

225
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,838
He looks content in these photos.

226
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:51,964
Fortunately,

227
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,091
he got along well

228
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,385
with Duk-mi and Eun-gi.

229
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,137
He wasn't a picky eater, either.

230
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,483
HEO YUN-JAE.
I MISS MY MOM. MRS. KO, THANK YOU.

231
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,068
DUK-MI, EUN-GI, WE'LL PLAY AGAIN SOMETIME

232
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,987
After Duk-su died,

233
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,948
I wasn't in the right state of mind.

234
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,285
When I had finally pulled myself together,

235
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,790
Yun-jae had already been adopted.

236
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,378
You went back for him

237
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,756
to the orphanage he was at.

238
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,219
If only I had gotten there sooner.

239
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,307
There are so many things I regret.

240
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,186
You and Yun-jae...

241
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,314
I'm ashamed to even be in your presence.

242
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,484
I'm the one who is ashamed
to look Yun-jae in the eyes.

243
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,738
You were in an accident.
You didn't abandon him.

244
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,282
I have another son

245
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,993
by the name of Si-an.

246
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,370
After I lost Yun-jae,

247
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,956
a man helped me look for him.

248
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,376
That was Si-an's father.

249
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,382
You might wonder how one
could start a family again

250
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,012
after losing her son.

251
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,391
That son could easily
be less understanding and resentful.

252
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,686
However, Yun-jae said this.

253
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,898
A widow is a wife who lost her husband.

254
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,859
A widower is a husband who lost his wife.

255
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,195
An orphan is what you call a child

256
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,280
who lost his parents.

257
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,367
However, he read somewhere

258
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,162
that the pain is so great

259
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,332
for parents who lost their children

260
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,334
which is why no one
could come up with a name.

261
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,673
I made my choices

262
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,592
so that I could cope

263
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,928
and move on with my life,

264
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,224
and he said that no one would blame me.

265
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,979
He told me not to feel sorry.

266
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,027
Although it's shameless of me,

267
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,283
I'm going to live my life
thinking that he forgave me.

268
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,452
The same goes for you.

269
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,829
You shouldn't live

270
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,832
in pain or regret anymore.

271
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,778
What do you think they're talking about?

272
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,324
I think my mom's asking
about your birthday.

273
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,837
Dad, what's that in your hand?

274
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,090
This?

275
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,010
It's pretty. Did you find it here?

276
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,137
Yes,

277
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,015
on the day we brought Duk-su here.

278
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,267
The day you brought Duk-su?

279
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,728
Your mother was still crying inside.

280
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,273
I stepped outside first
and spotted this stone.

281
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,944
I was in some sort of trance
when I picked this up.

282
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,905
But it was warm

283
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,157
just like Duk-su's hands.

284
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,081
So I squeezed it tightly like
I would hold Duk-su's hands

285
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,291
and brought it home with me.

286
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,879
Is that why you've been collecting them?

287
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,133
After that day, I traveled

288
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,678
all over the country like a madman
to collect stones.

289
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,017
To give Duk-su some friends?

290
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,310
Friends?

291
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,730
Is that how it is?

292
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,652
Can I hold Duk-su's hand, too?

293
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,320
Of course. Here.

294
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,033
You're right. It's warm.

295
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,285
It's like Duk-su's hand.

296
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,842
Mom,

297
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,178
should we live together
once I receive my savings?

298
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,097
What's gotten into you?

299
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,016
You've been refusing to all this time.

300
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,936
Let's live together until I get married.

301
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,354
Until you get married?

302
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,942
Between you and me,
my marriage will happen sooner.

303
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,402
Are you seeing someone?

304
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,363
I've been praying for
a husband these days.

305
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,365
For a husband?

306
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,242
It's not like I want much.

307
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,203
Someone who's kind, soft-spoken,

308
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,872
appreciative,

309
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,333
as handsome as Jung Woo-sung,

310
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,337
and owns a building.
That's who I prayed for.

311
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,424
Gosh.

312
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,385
I thought that I was
keeping you from marrying,

313
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,429
but it was because
you have high standards.

314
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,724
Why marry someone who's not up to par?

315
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,727
Okay, fine.

316
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,898
Then I'll live with you and my stepfather
who owns a building.

317
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,776
-Just focus on your own marriage.
-All right, fine.

318
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,446
Isn't there anyone you like?

319
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,910
-What? What on earth was that?
-Yes, there is.

320
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,369
There is? Really?

321
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,666
It's nice to see you
enjoying your time together.

322
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,530
I want to read this.

323
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
The Adventures of the Lion King Brothers.

324
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,450
Lion King?

325
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,246
Then I will read

326
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,248
-this?
-This?

327
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,958
-This person?
-You want to read this?

328
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,168
-I mean, this person.
-Do you want it?

329
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:53,426
BOOK STREET

330
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,386
A railroad

331
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,471
and The Road to Si-an.

332
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,683
Now, call me The Road to Ryan.

333
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,144
-The Road to Heo.
-"The Road to Heo"?

334
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,189
How about "The Road to Jae"? Deal?

335
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,073
This is where I studied art
in high school to go to art school.

336
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,491
Did you learn a different type of art?

337
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,244
Of course. I can probably draw the face of

338
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,162
Michelangelo's David way better than you.

339
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,456
-You want to draw me?
-What are you talking about?

340
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,666
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,089
Why are you buying so much red ink?

342
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,799
Since I'm going to draw you.

343
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,510
You look prettiest in red.

344
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:39,973
By the way,

345
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,642
are you going to continue to draw at home?

346
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,103
I thought of getting a workroom,

347
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,772
but I'm going to draw in my spare time,
so I prefer my home.

348
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,442
In your spare time?

349
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,321
Does my house smell bad?

350
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,159
I look good in blue, too.

351
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,119
-Blue?
-Yellow, too.

352
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,372
Of course, you do.

353
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,625
What does that mean?

354
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,045
There's no color tone that I can't handle.

355
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,550
Didn't you say you had
something important at 5 p.m.?

356
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,428
Would you like to come with me?

357
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,100
Duk-mi,

358
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,518
why are we here?

359
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,064
To buy my tickets to my Si-an's concert.

360
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,525
Your Si-an said he'd give you
free tickets to his concert.

361
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,444
I'm The Road to Si-an.

362
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,446
The seats he'll give me
will be on the second floor.

363
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,532
I want first-floor standing tickets,
within row five.

364
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,621
-Look carefully.
-Wait.

365
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,414
Let me fill up my stomach.

366
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,462
Okay.

367
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,383
Look. Do you see this button
that says, "scheduled for sale"?

368
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,386
At exactly 5 p.m.,
it will change to "buy ticket."

369
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,555
Then you need to choose the date
and the time you want

370
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,224
and press the "buy ticket" button.

371
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,268
After that, choose a seat
that's closest no matter what,

372
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,521
anywhere within row five,
and press "complete selection."

373
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,272
It sounds easy.

374
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,524
It is easy.

375
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,485
Until you see
the "seat already chosen" sign.

376
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,237
"Seat already chosen"?

377
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,948
What does that mean?

378
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,658
We have three minutes left.

379
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,463
It will soon be 5 p.m.

380
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,424
4:59 P.M.

381
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,383
5 P.M.

382
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,263
SEAT ALREADY CHOSEN

383
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,181
Darn it!

384
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,145
-Duk-mi.
-What?

385
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,440
Did I succeed?

386
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,566
What?

387
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,443
RESERVATION INFORMATION
1ST FLOOR, STANDING TICKET

388
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,364
I did it, right?

389
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,451
What did I tell you? I can do anything...

390
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,494
My boyfriend has
the hands of the Almighty!

391
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,834
Great job. You're so adorable.

392
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,686
Yun-jae.

393
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,229
Yun-jae...

394
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,711
As an artist, Ryan Gold's

395
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,964
hometown is New York.

396
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,175
I'll study New York's art trend first.

397
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,539
MONO ART GALLERY, RIAN GALLERY,
LORETTA GALLERY

398
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,781
Duk-mi.

399
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,037
Go in and sleep.

400
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,980
Several people pointed out

401
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:47,316
that the exhibition hall was too dark
and it was hard to see the artwork.

402
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,485
I'm thinking of installing extra lighting

403
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,280
here and there. What do you think?

404
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,573
If it gets brighter,

405
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,992
it may seem like the bubbles
are disappearing too quickly.

406
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,620
I'll adjust the angle of the lighting
and get back to you then.

407
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,788
Okay.

408
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,249
If you need any changes,
you need to tell me as soon as possible.

409
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,625
Before I leave.

410
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,127
Are you going somewhere?

411
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,796
I'm going back to New York.

412
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,759
There was a purpose
for coming to Korea, but...

413
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,894
-I came here to overcome my slump.
-Right.

414
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,106
I like my workroom,
and I made a new friend here,

415
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,651
but since I started everything
in New York, it's still inconvenient here.

416
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,738
I understand what you mean.

417
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,658
Why don't we meet up later in New York?
With Ryan, too.

418
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,160
Sure.

419
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,414
Why am I hearing my name here?

420
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,250
Ms. Choi is going back to New York.

421
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,212
That's good news.

422
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,631
That doesn't sound so nice.

423
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,758
You made the right choice.

424
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,261
In order to work as an artist,
New York is much better than here.

425
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,683
Take care, and call me.

426
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,020
What are you doing? You never shake hands.

427
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,153
Thank you, and I apologize

428
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,197
to both of you.

429
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,078
What's this?

430
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,288
Ryan, have you started painting again?

431
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,918
People in New York keep
asking me about you.

432
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,295
They want to know when the genius
artist Ryan Gold will come back.

433
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,296
Not yet.

434
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,173
I have no plans on going back yet.

435
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,885
-Why not?
-Because I don't want to yet.

436
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,637
Just don't spread any rumors.

437
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,849
I'll look forward

438
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,268
to your return as an artist.

439
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,331
Hey, what are you doing there?

440
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,333
How about some iced mint chocolate?

441
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,087
I was actually craving that.

442
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,009
Thanks.

443
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,678
You must be tired.

444
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,103
Director Gold.

445
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,024
Don't you want to make
a comeback as an artist?

446
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,485
I already did.

447
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,404
I'm painting, so that already means
I'm an artist.

448
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,159
Well, yes.

449
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,162
But the artist Ryan Gold was born,

450
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,413
raised,

451
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,666
and acknowledged in New York.

452
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,504
And wouldn't it be better
to work there than here?

453
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,549
Do you want to send me back to New York?

454
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,135
No, it's not that.

455
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,304
But I'm just worried

456
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,389
that you might not
be going back because of me.

457
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,602
I won't deny that.

458
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,062
But

459
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,730
that's not the entire reason.

460
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,735
My work isn't good enough yet
to overcome the three-year hiatus.

461
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,197
I'd be going back
on my decision to retire.

462
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,324
So if I fail to impress everyone
with my artwork,

463
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,453
I'll have to deal with
a lot of mean comments.

464
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,590
You can do it.

465
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,592
I can do it.

466
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,523
We're actually drinking together

467
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,233
before I head back to New York.

468
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,068
New York?

469
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,488
-Are you going for good?
-I came to say goodbye.

470
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,200
Thanks for being my friend
although it was only for a short time.

471
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,746
Can you at least be a little sad?

472
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,164
Why would I be sad?

473
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,292
We have cell phones.

474
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,836
Call me if you need a friend.

475
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,216
How about you come to New York
and open up a studio there?

476
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,345
Wouldn't it be faster for you
to open an art academy in Korea?

477
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,474
I actually have a secret to tell you.

478
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,312
I'm really bad at drawing.

479
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,647
But you're an artist.

480
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,776
Then I guess you won't be able to
open an art academy.

481
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,197
If you ever have kids later on,

482
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,325
I'll be a really cool aunt
who lives in the States.

483
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,826
An aunt living in the States?

484
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,495
It'd be nice to have an aunt
who lives in the States.

485
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,540
Goodbye, my artist friend.

486
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,334
Stay healthy, my friend.

487
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,467
Don't you need to paint?

488
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,010
I don't want to be a bother.

489
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,846
I'm not going to paint today.
I'm just going to have fun with you.

490
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,556
Wait here a little.

491
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,933
Let's eat after I get changed.

492
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,589
Your paintings have become warmer
and more complete,

493
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,384
Mr. Ryan Gold.

494
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,804
Duk-mi, where are you?

495
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,764
I'm right here.

496
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,643
What do you want to eat?

497
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,853
Yun-jae's homemade pasta.

498
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,606
I may not have

499
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,734
Anything right now

500
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,613
But I'm still relaxed

501
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,284
I'm still relaxed

502
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,663
Ju-hyeok, it's nice,
but let's try one more time.

503
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,373
Okay.

504
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,751
-Hey.
-Hey, Seung-min.

505
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,378
-You're working hard.
-Yes.

506
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,880
-Hello.
-Hello, Seon-ju.

507
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,800
She's Ju-hyeok's manager.

508
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,220
-I'm the manager of his fan site.
-Oh, I see.

509
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,181
-Please guide him well.
-Thank you.

510
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,435
Honey, we need to go now.

511
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,353
-I'll see you.
-Okay, bye.

512
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,357
-Please guide him well.
-Okay.

513
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,359
Please guide him well.

514
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,694
-Okay, Seon-ju.
-What are you doing?

515
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,195
I really hope you'll guide him well.

516
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,613
CHOIKANG JUDO PROMOTION TEST

517
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,908
Now, we will begin Choikang Judo's

518
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,536
promotion test.

519
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,079
Attention.

520
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,248
At ease.

521
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,375
Attention.

522
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,002
Bow.

523
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,046
Geon-u told me that
he's not in his best condition.

524
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,590
I see. But he looks fine to me.

525
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,552
First, we'll start with the back fall.

526
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,180
In three, two, one.

527
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,807
Okay, great.

528
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,100
-Hurry up and film this.
-Okay.

529
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,730
Okay, great.
Next, let's see you do a front fall.

530
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,983
One, two, three. Go.

531
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,985
Great. Now, get back up.

532
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:33,032
Next, let's see you do a side fall.
One, two, three. Go.

533
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,411
He's so cute.

534
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,330
Get back up.

535
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,623
Isn't he so cute?

536
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,375
What are you doing?
Why are you filming me?

537
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,794
I'm filming what looks cute to me.

538
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,548
My gosh, hurry up and film Geon-u.
Come on.

539
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,053
Now, it's Kang Geon-u's turn.
Please come forward.

540
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,056
What's my name?

541
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,183
Nam Eun-gi!

542
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,686
Mr. Nam Eun-gi!

543
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,397
That's right.

544
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,150
Here's your yellow belt.

545
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,619
Go back to your place. Go on.

546
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,205
Okay, next.

547
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,332
-Yu-seop.
-Yes, Ms. Sung?

548
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,125
Did you complete the insurance contract

549
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,877
for Mr. Ahn's Mono Art Gallery exhibition?

550
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,171
Yes, you just need to fix
the date of shipment.

551
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,034
Thank you.

552
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,538
Does that mean Ms. Sung needs
to go to the States?

553
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,747
Duk-mi's going to the States?

554
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,709
It's not settled yet, but she got
a request from Mono Art Gallery.

555
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,628
They asked if she could participate
in curating Mr. Ahn's exhibition

556
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,046
since she's the one in charge.

557
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,132
Either that or they asked
if she could recommend anyone.

558
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,884
It's too bad they wanted someone with
at least five years of work experience.

559
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,386
What a relief.

560
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,848
Ms. Sung would go, wouldn't she?

561
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,350
If she goes, she'll have to be there
for at least 6 to 12 months.

562
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,185
There's no way she'd leave
without Director Gold.

563
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,856
-You don't think she'll go, right?
-But she loves her work. She'll go, right?

564
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,317
-I don't think she'll go.
-I don't think she'll go either.

565
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,159
Do you want to bet 5,000 won?

566
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,910
-I bet that she won't go.
-I bet that she will.

567
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,495
-She won't go.
-I think she'll decide to go

568
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,247
-and then change her mind.
-That's cheating.

569
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,751
I bet she'll go.

570
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,670
Should I stay out of it?

571
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,339
-You should've done that earlier.
-Okay.

572
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,219
Why aren't you telling me

573
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,513
that they asked you to work
as a curator in New York?

574
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,770
Did you perhaps
have anything to do with it?

575
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,439
I only found out today

576
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,276
that Mono Art Gallery
wants you as their curator.

577
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,236
Have you given it some thought?

578
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,780
Yes.

579
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,365
And have you decided?

580
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,367
Yes.

581
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,244
So you're going.

582
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,121
Yes.

583
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,374
You made the right choice.

584
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,793
This is a great opportunity for you.

585
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,964
Does that mean we'll be
in a long-distance relationship now?

586
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,634
It's kind of romantic.

587
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,136
But I'm going to go with you.

588
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,226
Come with me, Artist Ryan Gold.

589
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,605
I analyzed your artwork
before your retirement

590
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,066
as well as the current art trend

591
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,818
in New York.

592
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,112
Your artwork

593
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,864
is good enough to make a comeback with.

594
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,827
Actually, people might be more
shocked than they were at your debut.

595
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,665
I'm asking you to trust me.

596
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,043
Trust my instincts and taste as a curator.

597
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,588
I do trust you.

598
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,299
I trust you as a curator, too.

599
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,932
But if I go to New York now,
I'll be a jobless man.

600
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,602
-How will I manage?
-I'll pay for both of us.

601
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,604
-Really?
-Yes.

602
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,277
Just so you know,
I have to eat steak every day.

603
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,195
Would that be manageable?

604
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,698
Every day?

605
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,491
Steak?

606
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,953
It's fine. I hear that meat
is cheaper in the US.

607
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,581
I know many tasty
but affordable restaurants in New York.

608
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,582
Really?

609
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,629
I always felt bad for
not letting you study abroad,

610
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,632
but you're finally going.

611
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,135
Take care, all right?

612
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,929
-Sure.
-So with Director Gold--

613
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,098
Please call me Yun-jae.

614
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,229
Well, I'm relieved
that you're going with her.

615
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,607
Please look after Duk-mi.

616
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,109
Of course. We'll call often, too.

617
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,946
Will you be saying goodbye
to his mother, too?

618
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,115
Of course. We're meeting her today.

619
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,825
She must be sad

620
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,994
since she just got you back.

621
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,080
You don't have to call us often,

622
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,999
so call her more instead.

623
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,793
I will call you both often.

624
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,050
I'm glad that you're able to paint again.

625
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,178
I owe it all to Duk-mi.

626
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,889
Well, I'm grateful.

627
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:53,685
They're both leaving,
so can't you at least stay?

628
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,355
Goodness. Look who's a baby again.

629
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,191
Are you heading back
to where your husband is?

630
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,527
Yes.

631
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,571
Both of my sons are doing so well,

632
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,031
so I should do the same.

633
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,368
Working as a volunteer teaching Korean
to Korean children who were adopted abroad

634
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,203
was how I met Yun-jae again.

635
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,622
I'm taking it as a sign
to work even harder.

636
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,252
Mr. Cha seems quite upset, though.

637
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,212
Actually, it's not because of us,

638
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,048
-but because of a certain fan.
-A fan?

639
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,885
Yes, what was her name again?
It was The Road to...

640
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,762
The Road to Si-an.

641
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,266
She put her fan site on hold.

642
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,769
It's just a short break, so I'll...

643
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,856
I'm sure she'll be back
as your fan someday.

644
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,321
Cha Si-an.

645
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,199
Si-an!

646
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,040
Your mom, Duk-mi, and I
will be back, all right?

647
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,137
I'm sure you all know by now, but--

648
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,722
Can't you stay?

649
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,015
We can't.

650
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,560
I won't be gone for long.

651
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,562
Says who?

652
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,651
This isn't a permanent farewell,
so we'll keep it short.

653
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,945
You all did a great job.

654
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,447
Thank you.

655
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,532
Once you make a comeback as an artist,

656
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,701
you can hold an exhibition here.

657
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,119
What's there to be upset about?

658
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,789
Hyo-jin, you seem oddly excited.

659
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,378
Anyway, now it's time to introduce you
to your new director.

660
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,633
I'm afraid I couldn't stop this.

661
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:58,101
I'm your new director,
Director Eom So-hye.

662
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,645
Ta-da.

663
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,688
It's my mom!

664
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,942
You all seem thrilled.

665
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,325
Duk-mi. My Duk-mi.

666
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,703
How am I going to survive without you?

667
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,121
I'll call you every day.

668
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,790
How would that suffice

669
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,958
when we spend 360 days a year together?

670
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,211
She'll be back, you know, and time flies.

671
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,839
You can't understand since you've spent

672
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,966
time away from her
while you were training,

673
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,760
but that's not the case for me.

674
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,762
The only time we spent apart

675
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,933
is when I was at the facility
recovering from childbirth.

676
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,477
Actually, don't you remember

677
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,188
when I sneaked in
disguised as your husband?

678
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,147
Right.

679
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,984
Director Gold,

680
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,112
please be good to her.

681
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,823
-I will.
-My Duk-mi

682
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,075
likes handsome men the most.

683
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,618
-Hey!
-She's not drunk yet.

684
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,495
She likes pretty boys, too.

685
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,830
-Right.
-Seon-ju.

686
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,331
She goes crazy

687
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:02,958
for cute guys.

688
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,003
All right. Handsome, pretty, and cute.

689
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,672
I'll try to be all those things.

690
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,593
I remember you being shy
when you were young.

691
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,637
Me?

692
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,597
Yes, you.

693
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,059
Seriously?

694
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,271
Director Gold,
please coach Eun-gi on dating.

695
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,732
Cheers.

696
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,859
She's always been funny.

697
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,945
Director Gold.

698
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,072
I'm not a director anymore.

699
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,200
Oh, right. Then Lion.

700
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,204
It's not Lion. It's Ryan.

701
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,332
You choose, then.

702
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,836
Lion, Ryan, or Yun-jae.

703
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,921
What should I call you?

704
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,925
Will you call me by the name I pick?

705
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,719
Of course, so choose one.

706
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,057
If that's the case,

707
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,478
I need you to listen to me closely.

708
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,276
You once told me

709
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,863
that my artwork

710
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,407
had improved.

711
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,246
I didn't know before

712
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,002
that there were so many things
I wished to paint.

713
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,133
The sound of breathing,

714
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,636
the scent of the wind,

715
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,597
the warm sun,

716
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,649
and...

717
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,362
the warmth of the woman I love.

718
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,874
I know this might seem too sudden,

719
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,002
but bear with me today.

720
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,506
This just feels like the right moment.

721
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,677
I'm telling you
because I don't want to wait.

722
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,772
Duk-mi,

723
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,986
more than anyone in this world,

724
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,697
I wish

725
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,909
to paint your happiness by your side.

726
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,375
Will you marry me?

727
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,390
Since I'm a fangirl,

728
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,560
I'll answer in my language.

729
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,066
Yes.

730
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,404
I will be your favorite star.

731
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,286
Will you be

732
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,123
my favorite star as well?

733
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,384
Forever.

734
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,863
Oh, my goodness!

735
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,156
Thank you.

736
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,950
Give me Cha Si-an's album.

737
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,243
Here.

738
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,912
-Give me a box.
-Me too.

739
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,288
-I'll take a box too.
-Me too.

740
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,040
I can't believe it.

741
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,333
This is amazing!

742
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,876
Isn't that heavy?

743
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,503
INDIE MUSIC

744
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,925
US, EACH OTHER'S STAR

745
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,223
Geon-u, don't fight with your friends.

746
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,434
If there's something you don't know,
ask your teacher.

747
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:16,229
-Geon-u, you can do it.
-I can do it.

748
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,898
I'll see you later, Mom.

749
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,859
I'll see you later, Dad.

750
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,194
Have fun!

751
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,071
Jae-ha!

752
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,242
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

753
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,202
-We have free time!
-Yes!

754
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,975
ONE YEAR LATER

755
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,330
My husband, Mu-san!

756
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,505
Mu-san!

757
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,219
Mu-san. Do you know how much I missed you?

758
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,055
-Sure...
-Do you really know?

759
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,348
Of course.

760
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,891
I missed you like mad.

761
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,395
Mu-san. Why did you gain so much weight?

762
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,982
Your face is so swollen.

763
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,068
Did the food in there suit you well?

764
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,322
Mr. Kim.

765
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,325
Mu-san.

766
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,080
Mu-san. You should go on a diet now.

767
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,623
Here.

768
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,379
Men should look handsome.
You know that, right?

769
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,172
You should maintain your looks
until you're dead.

770
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,090
One more time.

771
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,345
You look more handsome now.

772
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,937
-Ms. Yang Eun-ha.
-Yes?

773
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,065
You've never made coffee before, have you?

774
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,985
No.

775
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,574
Watch carefully.

776
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,951
Tear this...

777
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,787
and pour it in.

778
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,914
Is Hyo-jin making coffee?

779
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,418
That is what you call
a talented individual.

780
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,171
Mu-san should be here to see this.

781
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,471
The reason I suddenly asked
for a meeting like this

782
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,348
is because there is someone
I'd like to introduce.

783
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,978
Of course, all this time, I took care of

784
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,190
all the work here without any problems,

785
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,608
but our workload has increased.

786
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,443
It's difficult to handle on our own.

787
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:13,823
Mu-san might be upset
since I'm so busy with work.

788
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,619
So I think it's time to bring in

789
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,996
our new vice-director.

790
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,664
Come in.

791
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,209
She's not coming in.

792
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,628
Come on in!

793
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,767
Hello. I'm the vice-director of
Cheum Museum, Sung Duk-mi.

794
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,269
-Ms. Sung!
-Ms. Sung!

795
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,688
How have you all been?

796
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,191
You look just as happy
as when I came here. That's a relief.

797
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,859
Come on over.

798
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,070
You should all take time
to catch up, then.

799
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,325
My goodness!

800
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,330
I heard you became the head curator.

801
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,957
Curator Sung... No,

802
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,126
Vice-director Sung.
I filled in perfectly for you.

803
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,921
Yu-seop, what about you?
Are you a curator now?

804
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,466
Yes. And Ms. Yu and I are going out now.

805
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,096
It's seriously annoying.

806
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,932
Why does everyone at this museum
end up dating?

807
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,850
Is Director Gold...

808
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,896
I mean, is Artist Ryan Gold coming too?

809
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,774
Artist Ryan Gold?

810
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,292
What does that mean?

811
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,254
It means our son-in-law Ryan

812
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,214
has returned.

813
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,050
-Impressive.
-Gosh.

814
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,886
I told you to study English with me.

815
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,805
Hold on.

816
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,391
Mom.

817
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,935
Duk-mi.

818
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,229
Duk-mi! Oh, gosh.

819
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,897
My gosh, come here.

820
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,900
My daughter. Let me see you.

821
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,244
Is today my birthday or something?

822
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,622
My daughter Duk-mi has finally returned.

823
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,123
We need to have a feast.

824
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,001
Congratulations, Vice-director
Sung Duk-mi.

825
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,128
I look forward to
your collaboration with Moment.

826
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,130
I look forward to it, too.

827
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,302
-Dad.
-Dad. Are you crying?

828
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,472
No. Go on and eat.

829
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,182
You're so silly.

830
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:48,269
By the way, when is Ryan coming?

831
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,272
Yun-jae? He's busy with exhibitions
until early next year

832
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,982
so he won't be able to come soon.

833
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,901
That means he has successfully
made his comeback,

834
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,402
so there's no need to feel upset.

835
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,154
I don't feel upset.

836
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,282
I set a date for your wedding.

837
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,034
Wedding?

838
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,954
I think Eun-gi might hold a wedding first.

839
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,581
-What?
-What?

840
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:12,043
What?

841
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,878
I'm not seeing anyone.

842
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,172
You were talking with Ms. Choi
on the phone often lately.

843
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,925
-That's because she just...
-Just what?

844
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,219
It seems like they're quite close.

845
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,845
-Right?
-Yes.

846
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,931
It's not her.

847
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,141
There's someone else.

848
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,103
-Really? There is someone?
-I just got chills.

849
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,855
You don't even know anything.
Go on and eat.

850
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,816
-He must be hiding something.
-I know.

851
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,984
Who is it? I know everyone that you know.

852
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,236
Who is it?

853
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,115
Be careful.

854
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,996
You're here.

855
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,918
-Welcome.
-Seon-ju.

856
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,754
Is this your little baby?

857
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,047
"Hello, Auntie."

858
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,258
-Will you be cuter than Geon-u?
-Yes.

859
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,429
I thought you didn't have plans
for a second child.

860
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,097
It just happened.

861
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:07,682
Congratulations.

862
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,768
Right. Today's the day of
Si-an and Ju-hyeok's

863
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,646
first performance since they released
their project album.

864
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,356
Will you go with me?

865
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,775
I will. Of course, I'll go.

866
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,654
Are you two back to fangirling again?

867
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,949
Oh, right. Don't be shocked
when you see Ju-hyeok.

868
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,242
Why?

869
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,035
He thinks of himself as a total hotshot.

870
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,998
Hey, he can fix that anytime.
That's not what's important right now.

871
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,291
Eun-gi has a girl.

872
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,543
-What?
-I told you it's not true.

873
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,462
Is it her? That artist?

874
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,088
It's not her. It's someone else.

875
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,840
-You're mistaken.
-Who is it?

876
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,592
-You didn't hear anything?
-No.

877
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,634
You didn't know, right?

878
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,595
-What have you been doing?
-I told you it's not true.

879
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,054
-What have you been up to?
-Eun-gi.

880
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,015
-I was just joking.
-You're all grown up.

881
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,892
-You're an adult now.
-Is it someone I know?

882
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,101
-Hey.
-Who is it?

883
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,354
-Nam Eun-gi's "Life of Judo"!
-"Life of Judo"!

884
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:01,569
Today, we will learn about
the Tai Otoshi judo throw.

885
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,612
Before we learn it...

886
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,282
-Please subscribe to our channel.
-And press the like button.

887
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,743
-We look forward to your support.
-Thank you.

888
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,456
Mr. Nam, when is
the Tai Otoshi throw used?

889
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,666
Well, it is used

890
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,669
when you and your opponent
are grappling each other.

891
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,129
When you want to do a shoulder throw,

892
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,964
but when the opponent's
front leg is blocking you,

893
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,050
you might hurt your tailbone
due to the opponent's knee.

894
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,176
Take a look.

895
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,055
It's short.

896
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,683
You might not get hurt
if the opponent's leg is short...

897
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,648
What are you doing?

898
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,983
That really hurts.

899
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,778
Man up. It's not easy
to make money, you know.

900
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,363
Are you sure we can make money with this?

901
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:52,370
Mister, you're good at eating, aren't you?

902
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,288
Come here.

903
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,082
-Let's do a shoulder throw.
-Why?

904
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,918
-Come here.
-Eating shows are a trend lately.

905
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,796
-I'll buy you food.
-Cut the nonsense.

906
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,298
-Let's do an eating show.
-Let's turn off the camera.

907
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,218
Help me.

908
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,055
VICE-DIRECTOR, SUNG DUK-MI

909
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,862
Vice-director Sung.

910
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,698
It's time for the meeting.

911
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,283
Okay.

912
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,119
Yes, this is Sung Duk-mi.

913
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,788
You don't sound pleased
to hear my voice at all.

914
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,042
It hasn't even been a week
since I came here.

915
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,796
I feel as if it's been about seven years.

916
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,673
How are preparations
for the exhibition going?

917
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,884
I just finished a meeting,
and I called because I missed you.

918
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,094
How's Cheum Museum? Is everything well?

919
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,056
Everything's exactly the same,
including Director Eom.

920
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,141
Is that place also the same?

921
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,267
What place?

922
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,646
The place where we took photos
when we were faking our relationship.

923
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,067
Oh, this place?

924
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,861
Everything's the same here as well,

925
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,613
except for one thing.

926
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:53,032
Except for one thing? What's that?

927
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:56,035
My Lion isn't here.

928
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,877
Does this make everything the same again?

929
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,465
What happened? When did you come?

930
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:10,800
What about the exhibition?

931
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,094
I came as soon as the meeting ended.

932
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,262
I missed you like crazy.

933
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,264
I told you that I'll go once it's over.

934
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,308
You're the one who made me
become like this.

935
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,187
To be honest, I was also
having a hard time without you.

936
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,736
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

937
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,114
This is what a fan should do.

938
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,451
You're a successful fan.

939
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,830
Do you want me?

940
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:42,790
Yes.

941
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,639
Are you

942
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,349
currently a fan?

943
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,394
I hope you become a successful fan.

944
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,079
