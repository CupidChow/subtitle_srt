1
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,824
No, I shouldn't bother him.

2
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,283
He'll call me.

3
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,626
NEW E-MAIL
YE UI AUCTIONS

4
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,638
Director Gold. Did you meet her?

5
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,890
Are you all right?

6
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,060
I told you to sleep.
It's late. Why aren't you asleep?

7
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,272
I usually go to bed very late.

8
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,815
My nickname is Night Owl.

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,067
I thought we promised
not to lie to each other.

10
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,194
Are you telling the truth?

11
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,029
Of course, I am.

12
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,491
I called in case you were waiting.
Go to bed now.

13
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,830
Director Gold?

14
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,797
Are you okay? Where are you right now?

15
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,215
It's late.

16
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,718
I shouldn't have called.

17
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,261
Goodnight.

18
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,638
Director Gold. Director Gold?

19
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,736
Duk-mi.

20
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,699
Wouldn't I be worried
if you hung up like that?

21
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,326
If you want to cry, do it in front of me,
so I can comfort you.

22
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,578
What are you doing here alone?

23
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,540
You're making me so upset. I hate you.

24
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,965
Don't smile with such a tearful face.

25
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,591
I want to cry.

26
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,719
Because you're hitting me so hard.

27
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,783
Director Gold, are you asleep?

28
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,785
Yes.

29
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,621
Shall we go home?

30
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,753
I don't think I'll be able to sleep
if I go home.

31
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,546
It feels so strange.

32
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,048
What does?

33
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,135
The person
who I've wondered about my entire life

34
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,182
is sleeping right below my house.

35
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,851
It feels strange.

36
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,895
Then come over to my house.

37
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,486
But how did you know I was here?

38
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,071
You didn't know?

39
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,907
I implanted a GPS device inside your body.

40
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,539
Did I tell you about my parents?

41
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,794
The parents who adopted me?

42
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,879
No, right?

43
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,007
They were nice people.

44
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,514
They adopted a seven-year-old kid
and raised him happily.

45
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,142
My parents once told me this.

46
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,521
"Your mother gave birth to you
and raised you

47
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,107
because she loved you.

48
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,362
She had no choice but to let us raise you.

49
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,658
So you have not been abandoned.

50
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,037
You were being protected."
That's what they said.

51
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,084
But the person I met today

52
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,089
said she was sorry to me.

53
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,427
So it doesn't feel like
I've been protected.

54
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,598
It's like I've been abandoned again.

55
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,272
She probably

56
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,568
wanted to say those words all her life.

57
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,031
She loved you so much,

58
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,951
and she was sorry
she couldn't be with you.

59
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,165
Do you think so?

60
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,630
You should get some sleep.

61
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,341
You'll feel better when you wake up.

62
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,951
Mr. Kim, is Hyo-jin actually
riding the bus right now?

63
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,494
Yes,

64
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,829
she must've learned how to charge her BC.

65
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,082
"BC"?

66
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,084
What's that?

67
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,878
It means she learned
how to charge her bus card.

68
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,758
I thought she'd call me
crying to take her back.

69
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,511
But she learned how to charge
her bus card?

70
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,429
What do you think?

71
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,848
Tell me. What do you think?

72
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,479
The next stop is...

73
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,832
Did you sleep well?

74
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,834
What about you?

75
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,672
Director Gold. Ms. Sung.

76
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,010
-Hello.
-Hello.

77
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,014
Wouldn't you call this
an act of privatizing the art gallery?

78
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,850
You all came to work early.

79
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,019
-We came on time...
-Yes, we're early.

80
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,521
I don't think we need to change the sofa.

81
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,356
It's still very cushiony.

82
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,364
-What is wrong with you?
-Why would you do that?

83
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,825
Here. Eat this.

84
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,786
We have to see that kind of stuff
as we work,

85
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,538
so the least we can do
is keep ourselves full.

86
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,127
You're right.

87
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,006
Two iced Americanos.

88
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,509
-Can I get a straw?
-Oh, sure. A straw.

89
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,263
-Here you go. Enjoy.
-How much is this?

90
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,514
It's 800 won.

91
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,350
-Let me take your order.
-Two iced lattes, please.

92
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,851
Two iced lattes.

93
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,686
I'll take your card.
Would you like the receipt?

94
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,937
-No, it's okay.
-Okay.

95
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,774
So you're telling me that Seon-ju
helped you fix your guitar?

96
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,109
-Yes.
-And she went to your show?

97
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,945
-Yes.
-And she even made a fan club?

98
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,657
Yes.

99
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,453
-So you're saying Seon-ju likes--
-Hey.

100
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
Seung-min.

101
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,667
-What are you asking him?
-I was just--

102
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,127
Never mind. What did he ask you?

103
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,838
He wanted to know if you like me.

104
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,300
You're even doubting me now?

105
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,843
-No, that's not it.
-Ms. Lee.

106
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,137
Isn't it true that you like me?

107
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,682
What I like is music.

108
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,184
I like your music.

109
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,061
I told you, didn't I? She likes me.

110
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,522
I guess you're right.

111
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,690
What are you talking about?

112
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,442
Seung-min,

113
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,444
are you...

114
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,574
PRODUCER YOO JOONG-HYEOK

115
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,868
-What's this?
-My friend's a music producer.

116
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,538
And he's looking for talented bands.

117
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,375
So I thought about
introducing Ju-hyeok to him.

118
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,001
Really?

119
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,589
Why would you do that?

120
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,383
Because you like him.

121
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,719
As a fan.

122
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,932
So I figured you'd get to smile more
if Ju-hyeok becomes successful.

123
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,978
Seon-ju.

124
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,689
I feel

125
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,401
the happiest when you smile.

126
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,404
But I had forgotten that.

127
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,156
I'm sorry.

128
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,159
From now on,

129
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,745
I'm going to focus on making you smile.

130
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,374
I don't care about variety shows
or getting promoted.

131
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,084
I just want to make you smile.

132
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,919
That's all I'm going to focus on
from now on.

133
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,380
-So...
-But Ms. Lee told me

134
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,716
that she doesn't want me
to become too famous.

135
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,634
She wants to keep me hidden to herself.

136
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,804
-Should I leave you guys alone?
-You should've done that earlier.

137
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,021
Seon-ju.

138
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,565
-Seung-min.
-Yes?

139
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,817
I'm not forgiving you.

140
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,362
I'm just giving you a second chance.

141
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,158
Okay, that's all I need.

142
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,663
-Honey.
-Let me go.

143
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,749
I said I'm only giving you
a second chance.

144
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,628
Thank you.

145
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,687
CHA SI-AN

146
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,988
Hello?

147
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,270
At first,

148
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,730
I thought you approached me
because you heard some kind of a rumor.

149
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,109
I also got suspicious thinking
that you were after a scandal.

150
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,946
But I was strangely drawn to you.

151
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,491
The more I got to know you,
I felt very comfortable around you,

152
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
and I wanted to become your friend.

153
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,790
We both liked Lee Sol's paintings,
and you also lived right above me.

154
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,500
All of that felt like fate.

155
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,379
I guess

156
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,007
I was right all along,

157
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,926
Ryan.

158
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,851
Mr. Cha.

159
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,937
I'll send you my mom's number.

160
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,398
Give her a chance to explain.

161
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:04,111
It might be an apology or an excuse,
but give her a chance to explain.

162
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,072
Just this once.

163
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,671
Ms. Sung, we need to give

164
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,965
the final confirmation regarding
the catalog design by next week

165
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,634
if we want it printed
according to schedule.

166
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,802
How should we introduce
Lee Sol's paintings?

167
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,804
Have you gotten any calls?

168
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,849
I asked everyone I know,
but I couldn't get anything.

169
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,477
How long can we delay it?

170
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,062
Until next Wednesday.

171
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,065
Then let's look a little more.

172
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,151
Okay, I also can't wait to see
the final piece.

173
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,952
IF YOU KNOW ABOUT ANY PAINTINGS
SIMILAR TO THESE, CONTACT ME

174
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,912
-Two pieces?
-How many is that in total?

175
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,913
Eight.

176
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,682
How did it go?

177
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,644
The collector who sold the painting
last time found two additional ones.

178
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,188
They told me that they'll call
after they discuss selling them to us.

179
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,107
Gosh, that's great!

180
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,859
That means we only need to find
one more, right?

181
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,696
They're going to send us an image file.

182
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,781
We did it.

183
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,904
Knock, knock.

184
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,825
What's the "knock, knock" for
when you're already inside?

185
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,660
I have good news for you.

186
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,954
We found two more of Lee Sol's paintings.

187
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,998
Okay.

188
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,711
Director Gold, you know what
hidden picture puzzles are, right?

189
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,463
-Do you want to try that?
-What?

190
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,131
Come here.

191
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,100
You know how sometimes there are
hidden messages in movies?

192
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,435
These paintings also have
pictures hidden in them.

193
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,895
Why don't you try to find them?

194
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,148
Did you find them?

195
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,192
These...

196
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,237
Soap bubbles, a rocking horse,

197
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,947
a Ferris wheel, and a pirate ship ride.

198
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,950
They're all things
that children especially enjoy.

199
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,495
I think I know what
the artist was thinking

200
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,873
when she drew these paintings.

201
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,376
You do too, right?

202
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,757
Why don't you call it an early day?

203
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,801
I'm sure there's someone you should meet.

204
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,642
She'll most certainly be waiting for you.

205
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,214
It's Cheum Museum, right?

206
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,392
Hello?

207
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,146
Hello?

208
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,317
This is Ryan Gold.

209
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,362
I see.

210
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,822
I'd like to talk.

211
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,283
Could you spare me some time?

212
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,842
Would you like something to drink?

213
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,930
I don't have any coffee, though.

214
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,267
Tea is fine.

215
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,227
I can't drink coffee anyway.

216
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,318
Thank you for reaching out to me first.

217
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,907
I missed you.

218
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,995
I know that

219
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,081
I don't have any right to say that.

220
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,919
However, if I must
be shameless to see you,

221
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,046
then that's what I'll be.

222
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,052
I missed you, Yun-jae.

223
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,600
I...

224
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,061
don't have any memories.

225
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,689
All I remember about you

226
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,400
is how you looked from behind.

227
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,278
You were either painting

228
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,365
or leaving me behind.

229
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,499
Why did you abandon me?

230
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,128
I'm sorry.

231
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,466
Why did you leave me?

232
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,010
I didn't.

233
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,723
I only thought I'd be gone for a while.

234
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,143
I was going to return to you soon.

235
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,064
I didn't expect it to take 26 years.

236
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,694
That day...

237
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,575
I shouldn't have gone there that day.

238
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,872
I was barely getting by when I was
suddenly offered a sponsorship.

239
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,458
With the money,

240
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,128
I thought about
cooking you a delicious meal

241
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,800
and taking you to the amusement park
you always wanted to go to.

242
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,469
That's why we went out that day.

243
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:12,849
Yun-jae,

244
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,520
can you play by yourself for a moment?
I won't take long.

245
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,480
Where are you going?

246
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,568
Someone offered to help me
with my paintings,

247
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,028
so I'm going to meet that person.

248
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,072
But that person's quite scary.

249
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,698
Do you still want to join me?

250
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,536
Have fun in the playground.

251
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,455
I'll be back before you know it.

252
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,375
You'll be back soon, right?

253
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,001
Of course, I will.

254
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,009
I had no idea that it'd be

255
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:49,970
the last time

256
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,931
I saw you.

257
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
On my way back to you,

258
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,856
I got in an accident.

259
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,484
My gosh. Miss?

260
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,153
Are you all right?

261
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,655
It was a pretty severe accident.

262
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,659
My Yun-jae...

263
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,163
Then,

264
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,498
because of that accident...

265
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,670
That accident took everything from me.

266
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,673
I lost my precious boy.

267
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,968
Is this the truth?

268
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,432
Then the orphanage...

269
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,934
I didn't abandon you.

270
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,103
I know this might sound like an excuse,

271
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,774
but when I gained consciousness,

272
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,029
a long time had passed.

273
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,034
I searched for you everywhere
like a crazy woman

274
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,662
and asked around for any news of you
but couldn't find you.

275
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,790
I never abandoned you, Yun-jae.

276
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,126
I never wanted to leave you.

277
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,547
I'm sorry.

278
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,051
Leaving you all alone
in an unfamiliar place,

279
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,970
my accident,

280
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,973
and not being able to find you...

281
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,393
I apologize for everything.

282
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,691
After I lost you,

283
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,861
I lived my whole life in regret.

284
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,948
My whole life.

285
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,623
This might all seem
like just an excuse to you,

286
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,127
and you can still hate me

287
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,921
and resent me all you want.

288
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,423
But can you just

289
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,135
let me see you from time to time
like this?

290
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,848
Yun-jae.

291
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,937
I...

292
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,901
have somewhere to be. I'm sorry.

293
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,659
Why did you come back?

294
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,005
Can I stay like this for a while?

295
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,675
Did you see her?

296
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,389
Can I ask what you two talked about?

297
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,975
Words I want to believe

298
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,148
that can't possibly be true.

299
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,401
She didn't abandon me.

300
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,737
Apparently, she lost me.

301
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,742
Then what about

302
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,703
your memories at the orphanage?

303
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,374
I have no idea. The version I know
is completely different.

304
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,668
I couldn't resent her

305
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,047
nor understand her.

306
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,636
You were a little boy back then,
so your memory could be wrong.

307
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,641
Instead of focusing on memories,
let's trust her sincerity.

308
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,147
I'd like to do that, too.

309
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,209
You're my friend
whom I spent my entire life with.

310
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,837
It was nice to see you again.

311
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,902
Pictures don't lie.

312
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,532
EUN-GI

313
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,039
EUN-GI

314
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,712
Hey.

315
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,548
Duk-mi, come out for a second.

316
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,799
What?

317
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,259
I'm in front of your house.

318
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,553
It'll just take a second.

319
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,764
Why is he here?

320
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,397
You might faint and die if you
run hard like that at night.

321
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,192
There's something I really wanted to say.

322
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,651
What is it?

323
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,736
Happy birthday.

324
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,571
It's your birthday soon.

325
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,157
But why are you empty-handed?

326
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,326
I have a birthday gift, too.

327
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,997
-Me.
-You're so lame.

328
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,667
I've just returned as your friend.

329
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,129
Nam Eun-gi, who has been your
best friend for 33 years.

330
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,636
I'm really embarrassed to say this,

331
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,472
but do you remember

332
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,849
when I ran away from home
because I didn't want to be an athlete?

333
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,645
Do you remember grabbing me
by my hair and dragging me home?

334
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,607
I can't believe you still remember that.

335
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,694
I said you were nothing to me,

336
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,571
and you beat me up so much.

337
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,616
You told me not to say that to family.

338
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,409
Of course.

339
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,832
It hurt so much that I wanted to cry,
but I couldn't help but smile.

340
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,377
Because

341
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,879
you said I was your family.

342
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,344
I felt so grateful.

343
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,393
I felt that I should

344
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,231
stay like that with you
without changing for a long time.

345
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,359
But

346
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,825
I started to like you.

347
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,621
That's the truth.

348
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,212
But I realized something
while we spent time apart.

349
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,840
I just

350
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,427
like it when you smile.

351
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,682
Even if I'm not the person beside you.

352
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,643
Even if you're a fangirl,

353
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,271
or there's another man beside you.

354
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,734
As long as you're happy,
and you're smiling,

355
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,653
I'm happy, too.

356
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,368
You can call that a family, right?

357
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,546
My friend, who is so brave
and has a really beautiful smile.

358
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,797
Sung Duk-mi.

359
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,343
I'm sorry for making you feel
uncomfortable all this time.

360
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,846
I'm really sorry.

361
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,396
Will you accept me as your friend now?

362
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,401
Eun-gi.

363
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,571
Thank you for saying that.

364
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,617
And thank you for coming back.

365
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,624
You still have to give me a birthday gift.

366
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,794
I brought you one. Me.

367
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,421
What would I use you for?

368
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,548
A tiger is stronger than a lion.

369
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,092
Are you mad? I'll bring the Lion here.

370
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,134
-Bring him.
-Are you sure?

371
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,261
-I'll throw him over my shoulder.
-Don't be ridiculous.

372
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,860
How does a man focused on his work
look from behind?

373
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,237
Do I look cool?

374
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,280
You look very cool.

375
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,535
Si-an,

376
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,620
I have

377
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,666
a lot to tell you.

378
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,834
By any chance,

379
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,836
did Ryan call you?

380
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,551
How do you think he knew your number?

381
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,344
I know.

382
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,765
I've known for a long time.

383
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,769
That you had a very painful past

384
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,063
and that I have an older brother.

385
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,317
But why didn't you tell me?

386
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,989
It was such a hurtful memory to you,

387
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,992
so I waited.

388
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,537
I waited until I grew old enough
for you to tell me

389
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,956
and rely on me.

390
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,961
I thought you were still a baby.

391
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,257
Thank you, Si-an.

392
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,426
Did it go well with Ryan?

393
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,187
I guess it didn't go well.

394
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,148
I did something unforgivable.

395
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,654
Mom.

396
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,533
-Yes.
-Let's show him

397
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,202
all of your paintings.

398
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,954
That doesn't sound like a good idea.

399
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,623
Why?

400
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,042
All of this happened

401
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,128
because of those paintings.

402
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,090
It would be too cruel.

403
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,139
Ryan has to see
those paintings more than anyone.

404
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,350
He must see them.

405
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,728
At least for his own sake.

406
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,066
Mom,

407
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,901
wait here for a second.

408
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,587
Yes, Mr. Cha.
I was just about to call you.

409
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,423
We found two more of Lee Sol's paintings.

410
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,092
We expressed our interest
in purchasing them.

411
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,927
I'll call you again
once we receive an answer.

412
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,347
Okay. Then is there just
one piece left now?

413
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,474
Yes. We're trying our best
to find it, so--

414
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,059
There's no need.

415
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,105
-Why?
-I know who has the last painting.

416
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,234
I really hope Ryan will see
that last piece.

417
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,946
Can you persuade him?

418
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,309
She's walking

419
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,187
such a far distance

420
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,148
at this late hour? My daughter Hyo-jin?

421
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,736
Mr. Kim, check how safe
this neighborhood is.

422
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,697
Mom!

423
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,660
Mom, did you go grocery shopping?

424
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,246
Just some ingredients for japchae
and some squid.

425
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,915
Do you like squid soup?

426
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,500
Yes. I love everything that you cook.

427
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,629
Let's go.

428
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,423
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes, Ms. Eom.

429
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,343
Did you just hear Hyo-jin call her "mom"?

430
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,594
Yes.

431
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,221
What do you think?

432
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,015
Why are they walking arm in arm?
Tell me what you think!

433
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,392
I think you've lost your daughter to her.

434
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,198
Yes, Duk-mi.

435
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,117
Director Gold, I'll send you an address,
so head over here.

436
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,745
-What?
-I received a sudden call.

437
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,998
The owner of Lee Sol's painting
wants to show it to us.

438
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,167
It's the last remaining piece.

439
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,171
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

440
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,775
This is where the painting is?

441
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,404
Yes, the owner kept it in the cathedral.

442
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,322
So we agreed to meet here.

443
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,918
You're here.

444
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,631
Duk-mi.

445
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,467
-To be honest--
-She did nothing wrong.

446
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,721
I'm the one who asked her
to bring you here.

447
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,268
My mom also didn't know

448
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,770
that you were coming.

449
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,568
I'm sorry you came without knowing.

450
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,653
You can go back

451
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,156
if this is making you feel uncomfortable.

452
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,490
Mom.

453
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,785
Director Gold.

454
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,874
If it's hard to be here as Heo Yun-jae,

455
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,752
just think that you're here
as the museum director.

456
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,171
We need to hold the exhibition.

457
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,548
And in order to do that,
we need to look at the painting.

458
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,435
Can you show me

459
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,647
your last painting?

460
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,360
Ms. Lee Sol.

461
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,814
"Please protect this child."

462
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,819
That's what I prayed for
as I decided to keep this here.

463
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,363
You don't remember, do you?

464
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,490
This is Yun-jae.

465
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,326
Heo Yun-jae.

466
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,563
Mom.

467
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,442
I'm hungry.

468
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,405
Mom.

469
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,891
Mom.

470
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,525
Mom, I'm hungry.

471
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,448
Mom.

472
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,001
-What do you want to eat, Yun-jae?
-Doenjang soup.

473
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,711
-What?
-Doenjang soup.

474
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,592
Mom, is this me?

475
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,425
We're both

476
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,056
smiling.

477
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,153
We look very happy.

478
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,423
Mom, look at this!

479
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,304
Mom, did you see that?

480
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,143
It's so pretty.

481
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,511
By the way, are you okay, Mr. Cha?

482
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,137
I'm sure you were also startled.

483
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,058
I might not have been
as desperate as my mom,

484
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,851
but I've also been waiting for this day.

485
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,854
We finally found
all of my mom's paintings.

486
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,524
And we even found Ryan,
the child that my mom lost

487
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,569
because of her paintings.

488
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,699
-By any chance, are you an angel?
-Goodness.

489
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,160
People often ask me that.

490
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,248
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

491
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,624
It was nothing.

492
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,878
Ms. Lee, I'd like to officially
introduce myself to you.

493
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,464
I'm Sung Duk-mi,
the head curator of Cheum Museum of Art.

494
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,258
What brings you here at this hour?

495
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,721
I heard you know
where the last painting is.

496
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,976
I don't want my paintings to go public--

497
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,353
Will you take a look at this first?

498
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,822
FIFTH-ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EXHIBITION
WHITE OCEAN'S CHA SI-AN

499
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,866
If people only see bits and pieces
of your series,

500
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,909
they'll all come up
with different interpretations.

501
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,620
But if we also exhibit the last piece,

502
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,623
everyone who sees the paintings
will be able to realize

503
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,002
the true meaning behind these paintings.

504
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,547
Your ardent affection

505
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,341
toward a certain child.

506
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,183
I really want to show that
to Director Gold.

507
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,643
Not just as a curator,

508
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,063
but also for the happiness
of the man I cherish.

509
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,691
You must like Yun-jae a lot.

510
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,651
It's not just because of that.

511
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,403
I want to see

512
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,825
your official debut exhibition
at Cheum Museum.

513
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,912
Please give us your approval.

514
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:43,133
By the way, I've been wondering
if I should ask you this or not.

515
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,551
What is it?

516
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,472
-No, never mind.
-What is it? You can ask me.

517
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,390
By any chance,

518
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,768
are you my fan?

519
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:55,979
Your fan?

520
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,235
-I like you, so I guess I am.
-Right?

521
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,986
Yes, I like White Ocean's music.

522
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,321
Thank you.

523
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,574
We're going to release a new song soon.

524
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,326
What's the genre?

525
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,787
-It's going to be hip-hop
-Yes?

526
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,373
mixed with a little bit of acoustic...

527
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,735
You finally saw every single one
of Lee Sol's paintings.

528
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,279
How did it feel?

529
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,239
I realized something
once I saw the painting.

530
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,825
She loved me

531
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,160
and protected me.

532
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,415
I was a boy who was protected.

533
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,460
Then feel more of that love.
I'll let your mother be with you today.

534
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,175
Go on.

535
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,701
Ms. Sung, the Chinese art dealer
just called.

536
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,329
The seller agreed
to sell Lee Sol's paintings.

537
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,665
Really? We'll be able to put
all nine paintings on display then.

538
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,542
Did you locate the last one?

539
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,587
Shipping will begin next week.

540
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,505
Ms. Sung, Ms. Yu, we did it!

541
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,633
The merchandise is 99 percent ready, too.

542
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,176
I just need to put them on display now.

543
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,553
The exhibition will be held soon,
so let's keep up the good work.

544
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,763
Sure thing!

545
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,184
Why didn't you tell me that
moving artwork was this tiresome?

546
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,729
I forgot how exhausting it can be.

547
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,731
I wonder why we always forget.

548
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,691
It helps us do it again next time.

549
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,071
I know we're busy with the exhibition,

550
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,282
but shouldn't we be treated
to a nice team dinner?

551
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,327
I am no longer in possession
of my mom's credit card.

552
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,414
Maybe Ms. Sung's boyfriend can treat us.

553
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,041
My boyfriend?

554
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,544
Okay, why don't I ask him this time?

555
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,296
Get changed, guys.

556
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,673
Nice!

557
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,594
So these are the only places
that I'm allowed to use?

558
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,763
That's not what we talked about.

559
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,057
Additional pieces will be put on display

560
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,393
and everyone wants
a decent amount of space.

561
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,396
I'd appreciate your understanding.

562
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,110
-Hello, Ms. Choi.
-Hello.

563
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,363
If you're not done here,
I can come back later.

564
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
We're done.

565
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,908
Aren't we?

566
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,203
You say we are, so what choice do I have?

567
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,414
I have plans with a friend anyway.

568
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,373
A friend?

569
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,583
You have one in Korea?

570
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,086
Yes, thanks to Ms. Sung.

571
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,590
I'll get going then. Good luck, guys.

572
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,428
Thanks to me?

573
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,555
So what are you here for?

574
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,141
You'll have to spend some money today.

575
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,352
The staff members are exhausted
from managing all the preparations.

576
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,146
A team dinner would boost our spirits.

577
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,941
Fine. How about that
makgeolli place we went to?

578
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,526
No way.

579
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,778
-Why not?
-You're really heavy.

580
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,073
But I won't get drunk today.

581
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,117
As if.

582
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,287
"As if"?

583
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,331
Why does that phrase sound so mean?

584
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,667
You should study Korean harder.

585
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,173
Here's your iced Americano.

586
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,800
Ju-hyeok, is it true
that you're releasing an album?

587
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,553
I'll sign it for you when it's released.

588
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,848
You're what I call a successful fanatic.

589
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,601
You went from his fan to his sponsor.

590
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,520
It's crucial for fangirls
to have a keen eye.

591
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,815
I may have taken some time off,
but my taste is still there.

592
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,443
So that's why you married Seung-min.

593
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,321
Hey! Are you speaking ill of him?

594
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,240
-I thought you two were fighting.
-He's mine to bad-mouth.

595
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,453
Hi.

596
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,455
Hello.

597
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,041
Who are you?

598
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,711
I was here before.

599
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,381
No, you're meeting her for the first time.

600
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,345
Why did you want to see me?

601
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,181
I'll be too busy once
the exhibition starts,

602
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,225
so we should get drinks before it begins.

603
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,770
-On one condition.
-We won't drink for too long.

604
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,691
Can I use the restroom first?

605
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,531
-Hi, Duk-mi.
-Seon-ju.

606
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,282
I don't think
I'll be able to see you tonight.

607
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,659
A team dinner came up.

608
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,203
All my friends have plans this evening.

609
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,704
Eun-gi has plans, too?

610
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,207
Apparently, he has a new friend.

611
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,500
She's not a friend.

612
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,418
-A new friend?
-Yes.

613
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,003
They seemed close.

614
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,296
She's not a friend!

615
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,340
What will you be having tonight?

616
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,759
It'll probably be makgeolli.

617
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,345
It's Yun-jae's favorite.

618
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,721
Yun-jae?

619
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,144
It's Director Gold's Korean name.

620
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,563
Even his name is pretty.

621
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,481
I'll see you tomorrow then.

622
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,652
It's really hard to see her these days.

623
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,113
Seon-ju.

624
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,282
Who's Yun-jae?

625
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,077
Why did Duk-mi mention that name?

626
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,662
It's Director Gold's Korean name.

627
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,456
Director Ryan Gold?

628
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,210
Yes, he must've figured out
what he was called before his adoption.

629
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,342
Let's go and get drinks.

630
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,262
I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

631
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,890
-Maybe next time.
-There will be no next time.

632
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,057
Like I said, I'll be too busy.

633
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,476
We'll go for extra rounds next time.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

634
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,728
Bye, Seon-ju.

635
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,438
Bye.

636
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,861
If it's all right with you,
we could drink together.

637
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,696
I'm good.

638
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,365
It'll probably be uncomfortable.

639
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,783
Right.

640
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,899
-Mom.
-Yes?

641
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,152
You know...

642
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,737
What is it?

643
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,823
Well...

644
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,325
What is it?

645
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,662
That boy...

646
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,834
"That boy"?

647
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,544
Yes.

648
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,214
What was his name again?

649
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,387
Why are you bringing him up?

650
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,974
It's nothing. Let's just eat.

651
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,892
I don't know what came over me.

652
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,145
Go on and eat.

653
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,525
Here you go.

654
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,032
For the special exhibition--

655
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,826
Hold on a second.
Isn't it Ms. Sung's birthday tomorrow?

656
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,411
It probably is.

657
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,912
We'll celebrate it as a group today,

658
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,914
and you two can enjoy the day
alone together tomorrow.

659
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,208
What about the birthday cake, though?

660
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,128
PLACE AN ORDER

661
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,256
I'm ordering it right now.
It'll be here soon.

662
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,799
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

663
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,596
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

664
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,474
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

665
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,144
-Happy birthday, dear Ms. Sung
-Happy birthday, dear Ms. Sung

666
00:55:56,352 --> 00:56:00,523
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

667
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,527
Thank you, everyone.

668
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,034
The cake is really good.

669
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,705
Cheers!

670
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,127
What are you doing?

671
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,545
Are you keeping him on a leash?

672
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,882
He won't drink
a single drop of alcohol today.

673
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,801
-I'm going to.
-You can't.

674
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,511
Are you taking herbal medicine?

675
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,346
-No.
-Then why not?

676
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,307
He has something to do tonight.

677
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,726
As in what?

678
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,770
There's something
we're going to do together.

679
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,815
That was too much information.

680
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:55,203
So, are you two really going
to date or not?

681
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:58,081
What? Who do you mean? Us?

682
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:02,252
My goodness. That is absolutely
never going to happen.

683
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:05,713
You never know what might happen in life.
How could you be so sure?

684
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,298
Hey.

685
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,677
We should at least know that
nothing will happen between us.

686
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,433
-What are you doing?
-You should know how I feel, too.

687
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,811
Come on, please don't date!

688
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:23,565
I can barely stand looking at
these two dating.

689
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,317
If you two date too, it'll be so annoying.

690
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,735
-Okay.
-Calm down.

691
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,991
Enjoy a second round.

692
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,869
Director Gold, can't we go for
a third round, too?

693
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,078
Knock yourself out.

694
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,621
Thank you so much.

695
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,667
-Let's go.
-Goodnight.

696
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,837
Have fun.

697
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,215
What are we doing tonight?

698
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,550
You didn't even let me drink.

699
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,387
First of all, change into
something comfortable. I'll wait.

700
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:44,771
HEO YUN-JAE

701
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:55,865
HEO YUN-JAE

702
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,510
Duk-mi?

703
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,353
Director Gold.

704
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,723
Duk-mi, what is this?

705
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,059
It's my birthday tomorrow.

706
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,813
I want to receive a birthday gift.

707
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,868
Draw a picture of me.

708
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,705
You know that

709
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,249
I can't draw.

710
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,627
You can do it.

711
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,296
You drew my hand last time.

712
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,132
Just do the same thing.

713
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,474
I must remind you

714
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,811
that my profile is beautiful.

715
