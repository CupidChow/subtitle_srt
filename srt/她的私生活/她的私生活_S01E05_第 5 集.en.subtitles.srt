1
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,033
ONE LITTLE LIE

2
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,035
IS IT OKAY TO LIE JUST ONCE?

3
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,998
You know, about pretending
that we're dating...

4
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,126
I thought maybe we should give it a try.

5
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,587
Is it okay

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,092
to lie just once?

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,803
Hello.

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,848
My name is Kim Hyo-jin,
and I'll be working here as an intern

9
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
starting from today.

10
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,812
Once you lie,
it never ends with just that lie.

11
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,648
He's my boyfriend.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,109
It leads to a bigger lie.

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,863
Oh, gosh.

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,911
And it even leads to a much bigger lie.

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,332
So lying is this scary.

16
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,669
What happens if you lie a lot?

17
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,339
The pretty soul that lives here says,

18
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,925
"I hate bad kids!" and runs away.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,809
I believe you should explain yourself.

20
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,645
Well...

21
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,106
-Ms. Sung?
-That new intern.

22
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,652
She's the groupie
that posted my picture on the internet.

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,573
Do you mean Ms. Kim Hyo-jin

24
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,951
is Cha Si-an's stalker?

25
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,993
Yes.

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,164
But how do you know that?

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,125
Well...

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,003
I saw her taking pictures that day
in front of Mr. Cha's house.

29
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,006
I did.

30
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,678
You're going to fire her, right?

31
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,848
We can't act like we're dating
even at the museum.

32
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,891
I'm afraid we have to continue
to act like we're dating.

33
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,060
It's impossible to fire her anyway.

34
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,229
-Why not?
-Kim Hyo-jin

35
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,023
is the former director's daughter.

36
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,818
-Who?
-Even if she wasn't an intern,

37
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,945
she would've come to work here anyway.

38
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,239
So I thought it'd be better
to make her apologize to you.

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,615
Director Eom's daughter?

40
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,118
Yes.

41
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,833
There's no such thing
as a meaningless interview!

42
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,167
Oh, my.

43
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm seriously

44
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,673
sick and tired of my daughter
being a fangirl.

45
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,259
Do I have to have an employee
who's a fangirl, too?

46
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,052
If you're a fan of idols,

47
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,180
don't even dream of taking one step
into my museum.

48
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,361
Can you believe it?

49
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,739
When did it all start?

50
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,158
So dating at work is actually possible.

51
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,744
I guess no one knew that they were dating.

52
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,454
We never even imagined it.

53
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,582
Is that why Cha Si-an's fans
stopped harassing her?

54
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,335
How did his fans find out
when even we had no idea?

55
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,092
Here.

56
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,720
Who is that?

57
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,263
DATING PHOTOS

58
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,057
My goodness.

59
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,184
No way. Is that Ms. Sung
and Director Gold?

60
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,602
My goodness.

61
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,479
Gosh.

62
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,773
What are you doing?

63
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,984
Aren't you supposed to be working now?

64
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,156
Sir, were we allowed to do this
during working hours?

65
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,494
If it weren't for the intern,
we would never have found out.

66
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,329
You guys aren't even celebrities,

67
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,997
but a paparazzi took photos of you guys.

68
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,707
You're going to sue this person, right?

69
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,542
What? Sue?

70
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,919
We'll just let it slide.

71
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,880
After all, those photos
helped calm things down.

72
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,800
We should ask that person to delete them.

73
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,972
We logged in using the intern's ID
and took a look at the fanpage.

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,848
And she doesn't seem like a normal person.

75
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,476
"Your collarbone takes my breath away.

76
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,854
I want to die because I love you so much,
but I only have one life.

77
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,108
Si-an's thighs are like welfare to me."
His thighs?

78
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,236
"Are you trying to make me have
bad thoughts by being so pretty?"

79
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,117
So that means people get punished
if they lie a lot.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,953
-Of course.
-You must be very scared, Seon-ju.

81
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,876
And I can always tell
whether or not you're lying.

82
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,421
How?

83
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,674
Because your eyes cannot lie.

84
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,805
Do you want to die?

85
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,187
Nothing's going to change
just because we're a couple.

86
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,815
We'll keep things professional
at work as--

87
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,817
How long have you guys been dating?

88
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,445
How long?

89
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,656
How...

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,284
Is that

91
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,786
what you want to know
on your first day of work?

92
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,415
Maybe it's because it's working hours
right now,

93
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,085
but you guys really don't look
very affectionate toward each other.

94
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,483
I'm going to take Geon-u to the dentist
and drop him off at the studio.

95
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,109
-Okay.
-Seon-ju,

96
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,694
Duk-mi just sent you a text.

97
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,696
-What did she say?
-Just a second.

98
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,868
Hey, what's this?

99
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:09,994
What?

100
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,916
I told you last time. It's a photo
of her pretending to date someone.

101
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,709
I thought it was just a photo
of them on a date.

102
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,753
-But that's too--
-Don't they look great together?

103
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,171
I was their photographer.

104
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,008
My gosh.

105
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,011
Si-an's fan started working
at the museum as an intern,

106
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,930
so she needs to keep pretending
to date the director.

107
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,015
What?

108
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,518
I knew this would happen.

109
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,068
Geon-u, say goodbye to Ju-hyeok.

110
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,238
-Bye.
-Bye.

111
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,492
Let's go, Geon-u.

112
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,873
Eun-gi.

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,334
Do you know how many base stations
there are in our country?

114
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,419
Cell phones work everywhere.

115
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,587
What's your point?

116
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
If you have something to say,
just use your cell phone

117
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,717
instead of coming to my workplace.

118
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,802
Duk-mi.

119
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,388
Do you know
how many crazy things you've done?

120
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,225
You're not the type to listen,
you little brat.

121
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,562
Did you call me a brat? Are you crazy?

122
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,023
You're going to keep pretending
to date him even at work?

123
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,486
So what? What's wrong with that?

124
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,782
Do you not care about your mom?

125
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,742
Why are you bringing her up
all of a sudden?

126
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,245
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to worry you.

127
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,456
But even my mom knows
about your scandal with Cha Si-an.

128
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,790
Your mom knows?

129
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,252
You don't think she told my mom
about it, do you?

130
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,630
If you keep putting on an act,
your mom might end up finding out.

131
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,965
What are you going to do then?

132
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,426
-That's why I'll keep it a secret.
-Just stop.

133
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,927
-No.
-Don't do it.

134
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,387
That's none of your business.

135
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,849
I'm going to

136
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,934
tell everything to your mom.

137
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,270
I'll tell her that you're pretending
to date someone

138
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,730
just so you could protect an idol star.

139
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,023
Go ahead and see what will happen.

140
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,401
I'm going to tell your mom
and everyone at the museum.

141
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,653
I'll tell them who you are
and whom you really like.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,447
Hey, Eun-gi.

143
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,241
Duk-mi isn't actually dating the director!

144
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,659
Are you crazy?

145
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,161
Be quiet.

146
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,998
You're the one who's crazy.

147
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,376
This wouldn't have happened
if you were honest from the start.

148
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,462
Until when are you going to lie?

149
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,882
Hey.

150
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,551
It may be nothing more than a lie to you.

151
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,639
But my entire life and identity
depends on this, so stay out of it.

152
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,018
No, I'm going to set things straight
by telling everyone the truth.

153
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,479
-Where is the main office?
-Hey.

154
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,399
-Hey! Wait. Let me go.
-I told you to stop.

155
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,651
-Wait.
-Why won't you listen?

156
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,278
Will you let go? My gosh, stop.

157
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,909
Mr. Nam.

158
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,665
Hello.

159
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,418
I see you often at the museum.
You must've come to see Ms. Sung.

160
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,129
Yes, I had to tell her something
so she'd come to her senses.

161
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,339
What was it about?

162
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,510
It's nothing.

163
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,387
She never listens to me anyway.

164
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,930
Bye, then.

165
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Mr. Nam.

166
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,061
I would

167
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,480
like to learn judo.

168
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,815
You?

169
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,819
That's quite unexpected of you.
That'd be great.

170
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,779
You should come to my studio
when you have time.

171
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,532
If you're not busy, we can go right now.

172
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,617
Right now?

173
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,704
Sure, let's go.

174
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,964
CHOIKANG JUDO

175
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,886
"Always be courteous."

176
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,306
Judo begins and ends with courtesy.

177
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,601
A sport that has no courtesy
is nothing more than violence.

178
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,819
It's your first day,
so I'll teach you how to fall.

179
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,404
Please start with the techniques.

180
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,491
It won't be easy to learn techniques
on your first day.

181
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,285
I'm quite good at sports.

182
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,621
Okay, then.

183
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,832
We'll start with the one-arm shoulder
throw since it's easy for beginners.

184
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,628
First, use your left arm
to hold your opponent's right arm.

185
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,589
Then pull their arm
and put your right arm underneath.

186
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,841
And after that, turn your back
to your opponent,

187
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,510
pull the opponent's arm
and stand up straight.

188
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,263
Then the opponent's feet
will naturally come off the ground.

189
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,392
That's how it's done.

190
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,019
Do you get it?

191
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,520
Yes.

192
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,522
Then why don't you give it a try?

193
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,026
You're left-handed?

194
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,457
-You're a quick learner.
-Am I?

195
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,001
-Should I try again?
-Sure.

196
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,305
Okay.

197
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,614
-What's your deal?
-What do you think?

198
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,991
Am I a pretty good student?

199
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,326
Cut the nonsense
and just answer my question.

200
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,412
You obviously learned
for at least a couple of years.

201
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,038
Why did you pretend
like you were a beginner?

202
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,083
Because that was
the only way I could knock

203
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,501
an Olympic medalist out.

204
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,919
So tell me why.

205
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,256
Why do you have the urge to fight me?

206
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,091
Do you want me to keep talking like this?

207
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,010
It's not that I don't like it,

208
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,471
but we might grow on each other.

209
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,952
Tell me.

210
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,833
I think I deserve to hear why
after what you've done to me.

211
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,086
I overheard what you said
to Ms. Sung at the museum.

212
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,298
This wouldn't have happened
if you were honest from the start.

213
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,008
Until when are you going to lie?

214
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,968
It may be nothing more than a lie to you.

215
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,847
But my entire life and identity
depends on this, so stay out of it.

216
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,601
No, I'm going to set things straight
by telling everyone the truth.

217
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,894
Where is the main office?

218
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,647
Hey.

219
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,775
Hey! Wait. Let me go.

220
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,236
As you know, Ms. Sung is
of a social minority group.

221
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,404
Even more so
in Korea's conservative society.

222
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,033
So no matter what lies she must say
to protect herself,

223
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,452
I'll be there to back her up.

224
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,872
At least at the museum,
I wish her to be safe.

225
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,585
That is why I'd appreciate it
if you didn't do anything

226
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,254
that goes against her will.

227
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,090
What?

228
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,259
This stays between us.

229
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,136
She'll feel uncomfortable
if she knows that I'm aware of it.

230
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,013
Then.

231
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,103
Socially what?

232
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,981
Mr. Gold. Director Gold!

233
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,025
What do you mean
she's of a minority group?

234
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,111
Director Gold!

235
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,781
A social minority group?

236
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,575
Seriously?

237
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,786
Something that goes against her will?

238
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,830
What is he saying?

239
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,083
Mr. Nam!

240
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,545
-Hello, Mr. Nam.
-Hi, Geon-u.

241
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,714
Go ahead and get changed.

242
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,966
Good luck, Geon-u.

243
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,594
-Seon-ju.
-Yes?

244
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,097
-Is Duk-mi in a social minority group?
-What? Did someone say that she is?

245
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,850
Her boss heard us talking
outside the museum.

246
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,935
I said I'd reveal her identity.

247
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,978
What?

248
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,647
Are you insane? You're crazy!

249
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,482
Duk-mi already gave me a beating.

250
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,736
-You're lucky to still be alive.
-Tell me about it.

251
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,406
I'm the one who got beat up,
but he thinks she's the minority.

252
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,117
Even after seeing you two?

253
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,205
That's because he's never been punched
by her before.

254
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,082
Right?

255
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,792
Then tell him on my behalf.

256
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,920
-This is so unfair.
-He thinks she's weak?

257
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,639
Excuse me.

258
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,516
Do you not want this?

259
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,268
What?

260
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,729
What?

261
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,901
Didn't you swap rooms
with me at the hotel?

262
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,527
-It was you, right?
-Yes.

263
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,030
-And you're Director Gold?
-Yes!

264
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,115
Then why haven't you said anything
about it until now?

265
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,992
Didn't you avoid me on purpose?

266
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,577
Why would I?

267
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,580
Thanks to you, Duk-mi and I had a blast
in that suite room.

268
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,248
You went there without me?

269
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,959
Why don't you ever let me join you guys?

270
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,294
Why would I
when I don't even invite my husband?

271
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,797
Because we're friends.
Duk-mi isn't your only friend.

272
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,839
Shut it.

273
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,883
Excuse me,

274
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,095
but are you and Ms. Sung

275
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,306
just friends?

276
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,851
-Yes, we're friends.
-I mean,

277
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,603
are you two...

278
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,027
Why would friends stay in a suite room?

279
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,363
-At hotels.
-It's obvious.

280
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,531
Another pilgrimage?

281
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,367
Going on a vacation

282
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,745
at nearby hotels is a trend these days.

283
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,914
There's even a name for it.

284
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,749
We had a lot of fun.

285
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,585
Hold on. What about you
revealing the truth of her identity?

286
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
-Oh, that.
-The fake relationship.

287
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,636
You and Duk-mi are pretending
to be a couple these days.

288
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,472
He completely disapproves of that.

289
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,142
That was what he was talking about, right?

290
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,146
Yes, I am against this whole idea.

291
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,028
Are you all right, Director Gold?

292
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,241
I was

293
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:15,951
mistaken.

294
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,914
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,127
He was mistaken?

296
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,713
What did he mean?

297
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,926
That crazy jerk!

298
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,637
He was mistaken?

299
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,765
Me and her?

300
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,725
I'm sure of it.

301
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,643
He was worried
about me revealing your real identity,

302
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,854
and said that you were part
of a social minority group.

303
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,773
Then he kept asking
if you were just friends.

304
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,735
Pictures of you and I
pretending to be a couple?

305
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,694
Yes.

306
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,451
Her?

307
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,996
So that's why...

308
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,668
It's what you get
for being joined at the hip.

309
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,713
Still, how can he think we're a couple?

310
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,673
What's wrong? Is Seon-ju not good enough?

311
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,217
-What?
-You jerk.

312
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,054
I thought Director Gold
was interested in you.

313
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,223
It's sad to hear that he isn't.

314
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,975
You can still say that he showed interest.

315
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,938
-He showed love for all mankind.
-Shut up.

316
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,482
-It's upsetting, right?
-Not really.

317
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,817
I see you're all here.

318
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,568
-Hi, Seung-min.
-Hi.

319
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,737
-Hi, guys.
-We're here almost every day.

320
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,656
Where's Geon-u?

321
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,909
He fell asleep at Mom's,
so he'll just stay the night there.

322
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,244
Do you want something?

323
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,413
-I'll get...
-Seung-min, how about a beer?

324
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,458
Sounds good.

325
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,380
Duk-mi, are you okay now?

326
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,675
I heard about how you were harassed
by Cha Si-an's fans.

327
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,677
The issue has been solved.

328
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,053
I'm glad.

329
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,514
How so though?

330
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,890
Why do you ask?

331
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,600
Why wouldn't I

332
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,102
when she's your friend?

333
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,563
Seung-min, don't you start
with their fangirling.

334
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,106
I'm sick and tired of it.

335
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,315
Is that so?

336
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,109
Let's talk about something else then.

337
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,819
What should we talk about?

338
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,237
You need to drive.

339
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,125
Who are you?

340
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,751
She is

341
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,837
my girlfriend.

342
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,797
She's my girlfriend!

343
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,842
-I'll just do it.
-Do what?

344
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,468
I'll be your boyfriend.

345
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,472
Pardon?

346
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,391
You can have me all to yourself
for a while.

347
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,030
-Who is it?
-Delivery.

348
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,911
You have the wrong address.

349
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,496
-I didn't order anything.
-Hi, I did.

350
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,915
Can you get the bill?

351
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,713
Please enjoy.

352
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,341
I'm repaying you for letting me stay

353
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,051
and keeping my secret.

354
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,178
Is this how you repay people?

355
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,349
By letting me pay for the food
and making my house smell?

356
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,226
I'd love to buy it with my credit card

357
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,311
and treat you to a meal at my place.

358
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,188
But I'm on a diet these days though.

359
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,023
If I'm caught eating this,

360
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,650
I'll have to exercise twice as hard

361
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,109
and cut down on what I eat.

362
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,695
It'll be terrible.

363
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,531
And they still want me
to hurry with the songs

364
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,618
even though
I don't have the time nor energy.

365
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,370
Is that why

366
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,164
you pretended to have hurt your arm?

367
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,501
To focus more on your music?

368
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,882
Director Gold.

369
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,762
I'll participate
in the celebrity collectors' exhibition

370
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,598
if only you agree to keep this a secret.

371
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,059
Do we have a deal?

372
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,817
Deal.

373
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,739
What's wrong?

374
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,703
-I worked out today.
-And you have sore muscles.

375
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,038
That's actually my specialty.

376
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,251
Take your thumb and slowly press down

377
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,004
the back of your neck
in a clockwise motion.

378
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,047
Like this.

379
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,848
That's it.

380
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,142
Doesn't it feel better?

381
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,646
When did you learn how to do this?

382
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,901
My muscles were always sore
during my days as a trainee.

383
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,362
I didn't have the money to get a massage,

384
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,489
so I learned it off the Internet.

385
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,954
Your job is harder than it seems.

386
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,334
Is there a job that isn't?

387
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,547
I guess dating a coworker

388
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,507
would make it easier though.

389
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,595
Did you see the photos?

390
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,598
I saw them on The Road to Si-an's fanpage.

391
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,516
The photos of you and Ms. Sung.

392
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,520
The Road to Si-an wouldn't take
those kinds of photos though.

393
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,064
How odd.

394
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,829
I'm certain I didn't send those photos.

395
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,331
DATING PHOTOS

396
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,211
Hello, The Road to Si-an.

397
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,173
I'm attaching the pictures taken
according to what we discussed.

398
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,189
DELETE? YES

399
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,362
Thank you again for doing this
difficult favor for us.

400
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,991
Sir, were we allowed to do this
during working hours?

401
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,723
You have a meeting tomorrow
at 11 a.m. regarding the exhibition.

402
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,734
Why don't we just do it properly?

403
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,036
Then let's get ourselves
as many witnesses as we can.

404
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,177
He did all that because he was mistaken
about my sexuality?

405
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,015
Why can't I distinguish
between kindness and interest?

406
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,976
He wasn't interested at all.

407
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,650
Shall I see what they're talking
about at the fanpage?

408
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,533
"CUPATCH"?

409
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,202
What is CUPATCH?

410
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,209
"CUPATCH is a website
that digs into the relationship between

411
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,627
R and S of CU."

412
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,837
Are they really dating?

413
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,050
CU? CU... C...

414
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,386
Cheum?

415
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,974
Who is R of CU?

416
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,142
Ryan.

417
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,687
S? S stands for Sung Duk-mi.

418
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,482
Gosh, Sindy.

419
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,525
Has she gone mad?

420
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,569
I had a bad feeling about this.

421
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,448
What does she intend to do with CUPATCH?

422
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,786
"Digs into the relationship."

423
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,419
I hope Lion keeps helping me.

424
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,426
My gosh.

425
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,928
What's wrong?

426
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,597
I lost more followers.

427
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,432
My gosh. That's bad.

428
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,520
This is all because of The Road to Si-an.

429
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,480
I thought that jacket
was the only one in Korea.

430
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,565
Sindy is such an arrogant liar.

431
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,318
The Road to Si-an is taking care
of the total mess Sindy made.

432
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,322
My hunch was right. Why is she ruining it?

433
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,157
Hyo-jin.

434
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,243
Hyo-jin?

435
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,161
Keep it a secret.

436
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:28,962
Let's go.

437
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,760
Cheum Museum intern, Kim Hyo-jin?

438
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,013
Yes?

439
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,057
Hyo-jin.

440
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,978
You haven't forgotten your promise
to stop fangirling

441
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,522
if I let you work at the museum, right?

442
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,399
Of course not.

443
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,317
All right.

444
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,031
And what's the most important thing?

445
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,408
I can't tell anyone
that I'm your daughter.

446
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,492
Right.

447
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,578
If word gets out

448
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,581
that I let my daughter work at the museum
as soon as I resigned,

449
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,124
people won't like it.

450
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,126
You know what I mean, right?

451
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,711
Yes.

452
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,594
Ms. Yu.

453
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,387
-Good morning.
-Yes.

454
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,855
Isn't that Director Eom and the intern?

455
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,483
Yes. Why are they here together?

456
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,443
Hyo-jin.

457
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,696
It's a secret that you're my daughter.

458
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:37,947
Okay.

459
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,657
It's a secret
you're Eom So-hye's daughter!

460
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,742
Okay.

461
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,248
She wasn't just an intern.
She was privileged from the start.

462
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,375
My gosh.

463
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,365
Sindy.

464
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,836
I'll be nice.

465
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
-Hello.
-Good morning.

466
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,604
Here.

467
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,524
Ms. Sung, do you have plans tonight?

468
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,277
I'm just here to work.

469
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,653
Thank you for the coffee.

470
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,615
Are you really just here to work?

471
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,826
You're totally dressed for a date.

472
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,911
Well, I won't deny that.

473
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,584
After telling everyone,
you've become so honest.

474
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,883
The Road to Si-an,
how shall I return your notebook?

475
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,357
Director Gold.

476
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,944
Director Gold,
you should go somewhere nice tonight.

477
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,572
Ms. Sung is dressed too beautifully
to just go home.

478
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,865
Let's start the meeting.

479
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,060
From writers, pop musicians, actors,
directors, and sports players,

480
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,146
I've put in requests
to various types of celebrities.

481
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,482
If you take a look here,
you can see a list of artists

482
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,609
that are expected
to participate in this exhibition,

483
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,110
along with a list of their collections.

484
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,656
Cha Si-an of White Ocean
has confirmed that he will participate.

485
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,950
-Is he embarrassed that he was mistaken?
-He has quite a big

486
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,284
personal collection.

487
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,994
Ms. Sung, what do you think?

488
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,042
Sorry?

489
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,127
Aren't you focusing on this meeting?

490
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,964
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,220
The collection of the celebrities
are mostly painting works,

492
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,389
so I think it lacks diversity.

493
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,851
But we don't have enough space
to add installation artwork.

494
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,815
LIST OF PARTICIPANTS
FOR THE SPECIAL EXHIBITION, ROH SEOK

495
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,110
ROH SEOK, YUN TAE-HWA'S WORK

496
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,820
INTRODUCTION OF YUN TAE-HWA'S ARTWORK

497
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,408
INTRODUCTION OF YUN TAE-HWA'S ARTWORK

498
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,328
A COLLECTOR NAMED MANY PEAPLE
MADE THE HIGHEST BID

499
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,124
What about the unreleased artwork
of the late Yun Tae-hwa

500
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,002
that is currently owned
by the novelist Roh Seok?

501
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,921
Besides us,
other galleries have also requested

502
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,883
to reveal his unreleased artwork
numerous times.

503
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,886
But Mr. Roh refused firmly every time.

504
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,013
I enjoyed Mr. Yun's last photo too

505
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,807
and want to see his unreleased piece,
but it won't be easy.

506
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,853
That is why it will be more meaningful.

507
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,065
I will go meet him myself.
Where is he staying?

508
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,400
In Gangwon-do.

509
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,235
Gangwon-do?

510
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,822
I won't be able to go there today then.

511
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,033
I'll go next week
when the museum is closed.

512
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:50,992
Give me the address.

513
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,869
You'll go there by yourself?

514
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,881
I will go by myself.

515
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,175
That will be all.

516
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,552
Thank you.

517
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,409
Who told him to be mistaken about me?

518
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,745
He's the one who's mistaken.
Why is he taking it out on me?

519
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,997
No matter how embarrassing it is,

520
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,541
he is the one who suggested
that we pretend to date.

521
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,419
And he's the one
who accepted Sindy as an intern.

522
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,297
If he did something
to take responsibility for,

523
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,424
he should be responsible
until the end. Don't you think?

524
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,513
Duk-mi, you're so persuasive.

525
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,933
But why are you telling this
to me instead of him?

526
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,937
I can read Lion's face.

527
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:05,358
"Do not climb that fence.
I am a dangerous beast."

528
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,736
Duk-mi, Lion isn't the dangerous one
right now.

529
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,738
Our main job is at risk.

530
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,948
Main job?

531
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,368
I think Sindy is getting the better
of us lately.

532
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,581
What is that?

533
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,129
My gosh.

534
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,841
Sindy's younger than us,
so we can't beat her with stamina.

535
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,051
That means we should at least have
better equipment than her.

536
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,761
Seon-ju.

537
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,972
-Aren't I amazing?
-Yes.

538
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,266
Stop. I don't want people
to have wrong ideas about us again.

539
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,727
-Have a look.
-It'll be so easy to carry around.

540
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,145
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes, it is.

541
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,069
A COLLECTOR NAMED MANY PEAPLE
MADE THE HIGHEST BID

542
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,738
"Many Peaple"?

543
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,410
Choi Da-in.

544
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,475
Do you have

545
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,268
Yun Tae-hwa's last artwork?

546
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,437
Who is it?

547
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,731
I know you're "Many Peaple."

548
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,908
-Ryan?
-Do you know

549
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,409
what his undisclosed artwork is?

550
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,244
You went to Korea without even telling me.

551
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,247
You ignored all my calls
and didn't even read my emails.

552
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,376
Then you call me
out of nowhere to ask me that?

553
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,212
I'm busy, so answer my question.

554
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,632
-What's his undisclosed--
-You should answer me first.

555
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,134
Do you miss me or not?

556
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,682
Do you miss me or not?

557
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,147
I miss...

558
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,819
I'm hanging up.

559
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,071
There were a lot of rumors
regarding his last artwork.

560
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,073
Some people think
it's a landscape-oriented photo

561
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,909
that is taken
at a place no one knows about.

562
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,036
And his last photo was a photo of himself,

563
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,080
so some say there has to be more photos.

564
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:28,126
So I got curious
and called the writer who owns it.

565
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,379
But none of my offers
seemed to get through to him.

566
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,006
Okay.

567
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,177
Hey, Ryan. Don't forget
that you told me that you miss me.

568
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,477
I really don't get what she's thinking.

569
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,779
CUPATCH
ARE R AND S REALLY A COUPLE?

570
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,783
Director Gold,
you should go somewhere nice tonight.

571
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,619
Ms. Sung is dressed too beautifully
to just go home.

572
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,912
Let's start the meeting.

573
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,923
S dressed up really nicely today,

574
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,717
but R seemed totally uninterested.

575
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,970
Are they just trying
to keep things professional at work? Or...

576
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,847
LEVEL OF SUSPICION: TWO

577
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,808
When do you think
Ms. Sung and Director Gold

578
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,560
started dating each other?

579
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,061
That's what I'm really curious about.

580
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,315
They first met each other
when Director Gold was appointed.

581
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,858
I thought they weren't on good terms.

582
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,735
It was way worse than that.

583
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,154
Director Gold even fired Ms. Sung.

584
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,406
-Exactly.
-Is that why she fell for him?

585
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,826
"You're the first guy who ever fired me."

586
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,412
-Something like that.
-Come on.

587
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,166
S got fired by R before.

588
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,210
Is that what made her fall for him?
Is she a pervert?

589
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,711
Or...

590
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,007
LEVEL OF SUSPICION: THREE

591
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,064
R left the museum at 9:13 p.m. by himself.

592
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,076
R arrived at his place
at 10:07 p.m. by himself.

593
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,245
S was not with him,
and they did not go on a date.

594
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,121
Are they enjoying platonic love? Or...

595
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,916
LEVEL OF SUSPICION: FOUR

596
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,127
Something's fishy.

597
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,255
I'm going to find out
what it is no matter what.

598
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,930
-Hello?
-Did you read CUPATCH?

599
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,640
Sindy uploaded something.

600
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,058
Wait.

601
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,062
R LEAVES THE OFFICE ALONE
ARE THEY ENJOYING PLATONIC LOVE?

602
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,480
LEVEL OF SUSPICION: FOUR

603
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,942
Sindy's totally obsessed.

604
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,903
What should I do?
Should I go on another date?

605
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,406
Duk-mi, rather than uploading 100 photos
of you guys on a date,

606
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,491
wouldn't it be better
to just show you guys in action?

607
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,785
What exactly are you talking about?

608
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,497
I'm saying you guys should spend
the night together somewhere.

609
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,166
Do something
that will fire up her imagination.

610
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,210
Oh, I get it now.

611
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,588
But how am I going to do that?

612
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,117
He's really going alone.

613
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,910
I knew it.

614
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,832
What?

615
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,754
Honey, open the door.

616
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,516
I thought I told you
that I'll go by myself.

617
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,812
Mr. Roh tends to get really shy
around people he doesn't know.

618
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,564
I'll be fine.

619
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,027
You may be fine,
but you should think about him.

620
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,446
You're on your way to ask him for a favor.

621
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,406
Don't you think
you should be more considerate?

622
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,088
Gosh, it's hot.

623
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,166
What would he have done without me?

624
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,177
This won't work.
Let's just call the insurance company.

625
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,095
Okay, I think that would be better.

626
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,556
-Thank you.
-No, I'm the one at fault for not having

627
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,183
a driver's license at this age.

628
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,810
We're deep in the mountains.
It'll take a while.

629
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,770
We should start walking
since Mr. Roh will be waiting.

630
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,730
Okay.

631
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,863
-I'm okay.
-Just wear it.

632
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,470
Mr. Roh!

633
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,347
Are you inside?

634
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,644
Sir. Mr. Roh!

635
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,942
Do you even know what time it is?

636
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,360
I mean,

637
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,987
it's not like I asked you to come.

638
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,406
You should've at least called
to let me know that you'll be late.

639
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,412
It's nice to meet you.

640
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,665
I'm Cheum Museum's--

641
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,708
Do you want to freeze to death
while being polite?

642
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,293
Hurry on inside.

643
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,795
Thank you.

644
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,393
I'm sorry, sir.

645
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,853
So why would you come all the way here?

646
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,816
I already told you many times
that I wouldn't reveal the artwork.

647
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,403
Anyway, change into these first.

648
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,406
It's upsetting enough
to go back empty-handed,

649
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,949
so at least save yourself from a cold.

650
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:57,908
Sir,

651
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,537
please hear us out first
and then decide on what to do.

652
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,789
-The bathroom is that way.
-Sir.

653
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,233
Ms. Sung,

654
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,402
is something wrong?

655
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,446
No, I'm fine.

656
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,287
Do you need any help?

657
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,167
I do.

658
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,462
I'm coming in then.

659
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,928
My scarf got tangled in my hair.

660
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,846
My hair got tangled around the button.

661
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,027
Thank you for taking it off.

662
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,323
I mean, the scarf.

663
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,373
Mr. Roh

664
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,543
seems adamant, right?

665
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,628
Yes, it seems that way.

666
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,717
I'll still ask him again.

667
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,719
Sure.

668
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,804
Get changed then.

669
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,819
Isn't it Duk-mi's day off?
Call her over for dinner.

670
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,530
She went on a business trip.

671
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,116
A business trip? With whom?

672
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,954
Where? For how long?

673
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,581
I don't know.

674
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Mom,

675
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,502
call Duk-mi.

676
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,837
What for when she's working?

677
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,131
You're so nonchalant
when it comes to these things.

678
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,674
You were when Duk-mi moved out too.

679
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,135
Guys these days want girlfriends
who live alone.

680
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,094
Right.

681
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,888
I saw it on the news.

682
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,225
Kids these days have dates
at home to save money,

683
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,809
and they split the bills.

684
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,603
Oh, my.

685
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,231
-I'm against punks like that!
-My gosh.

686
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,942
No decent man would
let a woman pay for meals.

687
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,112
Can you give us notice before you talk?

688
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,781
My heart just jumped.

689
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,159
Also, are you saying that those
without money shouldn't date?

690
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,745
I wouldn't.

691
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,334
You must've spent a lot
when you two dated.

692
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,045
That's not all.

693
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,881
He gave me flowers
and gifts on every date.

694
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,300
I thought I had become a princess.

695
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,427
You are a real man, Dad.

696
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,351
Who knew I'd end up like this?

697
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,776
Devoted and considerate boyfriends
become lousy husbands,

698
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,946
so bad boys would make even worse spouses.

699
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,864
The same goes for girls.

700
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,242
Cut them loose if they're not good.

701
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,451
Sure thing.

00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,547
CELEBRITY COLLECTORS' EXHIBITION

703
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,760
I know you already rejected our offer,

704
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,972
but we're here to persuade you once more.

705
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,101
Please let us put
the late Yun Tae-hwa's unreleased work

706
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,563
that you have in possession
on display at Cheum Museum's

707
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,231
fifth-anniversary exhibition.

708
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,985
Mr. Roh.

709
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:29,323
I heard that you were good friends
with the late Mr. Yun.

710
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,869
He even entrusted you
with his unreleased work.

711
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,289
Is there a reason he'd leave them to you?

712
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,211
Tae-hwa and I met in middle school.

713
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,839
He started taking photos

714
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,009
while I started to write
a few unpolished novels.

715
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,763
From his first photo to his very last,

716
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,058
I'd probably seen them all.

717
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,393
Tae-hwa read all of my work too.

718
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,938
Artists are known to be sensitive,

719
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,399
but we've been friends for 30 years.

720
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,527
So we understood each other very well.

721
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,572
He entrusted me with his last photos

722
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,742
instead of his family because...

723
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,414
they are of poor quality.

724
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,000
So he didn't want anyone to see it.

725
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,628
I'm sure it was his way of telling me

726
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,755
not to reveal them to anyone.

727
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,549
-Mr. Roh, but--
-I won't reveal them.

728
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,927
You can talk all you want,

729
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,680
but I will never change my mind.

730
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,518
Since you came all this way to see me,

731
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,063
I suggest you stay
for a good night's sleep here.

732
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,273
Goodnight then.

733
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,002
Director Gold, you're cold, aren't you?

734
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,381
Come on. Let's swap places.

735
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,426
-It's all right.
-But it'll get colder at night. Come here.

736
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,552
Ms. Sung,

737
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,804
I'm fine.

738
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,995
-Director Gold.
-Yes.

739
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,374
I know that you mistook my relationship
with Seon-ju.

740
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,128
You suggested this fake relationship
because you were worried

741
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,505
that Mr. Cha's fans might find out
and reveal it.

742
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,094
I didn't do it out of pity.
It's nothing to pity anyway.

743
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,348
Whatever your reasons were, I'm grateful.

744
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,144
I'm more grateful than you think.

745
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,489
Ms. Sung.

746
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,157
Yes?

747
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,117
Can I ask you something?

748
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,119
Sure.

749
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,000
Do you like taking pictures?

750
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:28,835
Portraits.

751
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,014
Is it because of this?

752
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,558
You remembered that I liked this picture.

753
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,936
Sure.

754
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,356
This picture was memorable.

755
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:53,109
He took landscape pictures all his life
but the last piece of work

756
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,028
that he revealed was a portrait
of himself.

757
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,030
Since he passed away from an illness,

758
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,616
maybe that was his last farewell.

759
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,868
Even the title is Goodbye.

760
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,331
He named the title in Korean
which could mean both hello and goodbye.

761
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,625
He didn't make an English title himself.

762
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,087
I think it was a mistranslation.

763
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,339
No, I'm certain.

764
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,386
What are the grounds for that?

765
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,012
Look.

766
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,432
If he really wanted
to say the last goodbye

767
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,726
and if it was a farewell meant
for himself,

768
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm sure he would've looked
into the camera.

769
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:35,318
Because for a photographer,
his camera is like his other self.

770
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,910
And if this was a farewell
to the world he lived in,

771
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,164
he would've looked down and a bit further.

772
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,418
Or he would've taken a picture
of his profile.

773
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,422
What if it wasn't a goodbye but a greeting

774
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,049
to the world that he was about to meet
for the first time?

775
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,261
I've thought about that possibility
as well.

776
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:05,432
Then maybe he would've looked up
more towards the sky.

777
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,978
Then what is your theory?

778
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,482
There is someone in front of the camera.

779
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,364
These eyes aren't

780
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,660
the eyes of a sad farewell
or one's eyes waiting for death.

781
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,706
He's looking at someone he loves.

782
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,753
He wanted to leave this for that person.

783
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,672
He was looking at this person,

784
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,675
and his eyes were greeting that person.

785
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,054
"Hello, I'm here.

786
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,807
I'm always here looking at you like this.

787
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,060
Hi."

788
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,157
Hi.

789
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,341
It's just my theory.

790
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,428
-You must be tired. Let's sleep.
-Okay.

791
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,371
Mr. Roh, we'll be leaving now.

792
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,374
Thank you so much
for letting us stay here.

793
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,125
It's been a long time for me too.

794
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,256
Mr. Roh, these are...

795
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,758
My father used to be a soldier.

796
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,594
He was always ashamed

797
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,889
that his only son was nothing like him.

798
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,141
When I said I wanted to be a novelist,

799
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,228
he didn't even speak to me for years.

800
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,232
So I couldn't accept it.

801
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,111
I couldn't acknowledge

802
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,862
Tae-hwa's feelings.

803
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,535
These pictures

804
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,664
were love letters from Mr. Yun.

805
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,625
They were for you.

806
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,211
That's why I couldn't reveal them.

807
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,340
It was a secret that I wanted
to take with me to the grave.

808
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,511
It's not because I didn't like
how Tae-hwa felt.

809
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,889
It was because I was ashamed

810
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,975
of being such a coward

811
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,270
that I knowingly ignored his feelings
until the end.

812
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,398
How could I reveal his heart now

813
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,444
when Tae-hwa is no longer around?

814
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,697
It's too late.

815
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,413
Did you really ignore his feelings?

816
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,334
Because your face says differently.

817
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,173
Although you may not know
how you truly felt,

818
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,966
I'm pretty sure Mr. Yun knew.

819
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,595
When he saw those eyes
through the viewfinder,

820
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,390
how could he not know as a photographer?

821
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,567
He must've known.

822
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,320
Do you think so?

823
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,951
Did he know?

824
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,284
You did a great job.

825
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,661
I never planned
on spending the night there though.

826
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,165
I liked that we spent the night there.

827
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,333
What?

828
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:20,129
No, that's not what I meant.
It's because of Hyo-jin.

829
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,590
Hyo-jin created something
called a CUPATCH.

830
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,675
A CUPATCH?

831
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,512
Yes, that means she's keeping an eye on us

832
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,430
because she's suspicious
of our relationship.

833
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,766
That's actually why I kept trying so hard

834
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,309
to make it seem like we're a couple.

835
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,020
Okay.

836
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,440
Then let's do a proper job in fooling her.

837

THE ROAD TO SI-AN
A NEW POST HAS BEEN UPLOADED

840
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,551
New members?

841
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,847
I should greet them.

842
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,143
THE ROAD TO SI-AN
A NEW POST HAS BEEN UPLOADED

843
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,103
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

844
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,188
Hello, Flaming Si-an.

845
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:04,150
Hello, Shine Si-an. Hello, Latte.

846
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,574
Hello, My Only Hope Si-an.

847
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,535
Hello, Si-an in My Heart.

848
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,594
Hello, Additional Bankbook.

849
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,387
Hello.

850
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,431
Hello, Pink Si-an.

851
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,267
Hello, Heart-throb. Hello, Si-an's Spring.

852
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,436
Hello, Si-an Approved.

853
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:48,235
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

854
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,658
Hello, Latte.

855
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,163
Nice to meet you,

856
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,290
Ms. Sung.

857
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,126
Hello.

858
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,784
That was all one person?

859
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:37,994
A test?

860
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,162
What am I looking at?

861
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,415
Is this an opening act of a mysterious
and illicit love story?

862
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,375
I found another one
of Lee Sol's paintings.

863
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,711
How do you know that?
There's no information about Lee Sol.

864
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,629
I missed you, Ryan.

865
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,715
Can I be a little more ambitious, then?

866
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,675
But there are no secrets in this world.

867
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,219
-Director Gold.
-Do you actually think

868
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,512
we're really dating or something?

869
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,305
I was worried he might be
disappointed in me.

870
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,890
You must really like him.

871
