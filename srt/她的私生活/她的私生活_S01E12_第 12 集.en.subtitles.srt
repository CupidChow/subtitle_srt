1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,997
Why aren't you asking me anything?

2
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,393
I had a dream.

3
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,523
Was it a scary dream?

4
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,026
It wasn't just a dream.

5
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,864
It was scary since it was from my memory.

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,455
It was the day I was abandoned
at the orphanage.

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,713
I barely have any memories

8
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,885
from before I was seven
which was when I was adopted.

9
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,389
But I still remember that day faintly.

10
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,936
That hand that let go of me

11
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,271
so coldly.

12
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,614
I remember that moment vividly.

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,537
Is that why...

14
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,915
That's why I don't like letting go
of someone's hand that I'm holding.

15
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,959
I can't handle

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,005
that feeling of being left alone.

17
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,010
Do you feel okay now?

18
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,933
I'm right here with you, Duk-mi.

19
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,480
Then I guess we should keep
staying together like this.

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,359
You'll make me go to work
without letting me get any sleep?

21
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,070
Yes.

22
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,659
I had scary dreams often
when I was a kid, too.

23
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,830
I can't exactly remember
what the dreams were about,

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,750
but I woke up screaming and crying.

25
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,461
Every time that happened,
I bothered my whole family

26
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,755
and didn't let them get any sleep.

27
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,675
And whenever that happened, my mom

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,762
didn't force me to go to sleep.
She just spent time with me all night.

29
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,435
So this time,

30
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,981
I will spend time with you all night.

31
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,317
-All night?
-All night.

32
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,986
-Let's go.
-Where?

33
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,404
Where do you think?

34
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,868
But once you step inside,
you can't go out.

35
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,369
Follow me.

36
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,164
I wonder where...

37
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,296
What is this?

38
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,966
They're Hwatu, traditional game cards.

39
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,136
We'll play Go-stop, where deciding
whether to go or stop is important.

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,472
It's a very profound game
that reflects all aspects of life.

41
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,515
Is this what you meant by
spending time with me

42
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,851
-all night?
-Yes.

43
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,646
Was there something else you wanted to do?

44
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,564
No, of course not.

45
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,776
These cards look very colorful.

46
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,945
Trump cards can be seen semiological,

47
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,696
whereas Hwatu is more about the design.

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,490
That's not important.

49
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,117
Let me explain the most critical
and main rules.

50
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,286
Look here. There are five birds.

51
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,789
Three here, one here, and one here.
This is called godori.

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,208
This is worth five points.
There's no need to memorize the names.

53
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,877
Do you see these five cards
that say gwang on them?

54
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,878
These are the five gwangs.

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,755
Five of these cards are worth 15 points.

56
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,507
These two are the best cards.

57
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,510
Do you see these with sashes around
them like a beauty pageant?

58
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,553
The empty ones are chodan,

59
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,139
the red ones are hongdan,
and the blue ones are cheongdan.

60
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,558
These are worth three points.
Three points each.

61
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,560
In summary, five, five,
three, three, and three points.

62
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,562
And it's better if you take
as many cards as possible.

63
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,022
You won't understand now anyway, so...

64
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,482
-The more the better?
-Right.

65
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,817
That's the end of my explanation.

66
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,902
That's it?

67
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,447
You can't learn Go-stop with words.

68
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,616
You have to get hit
while you play so you don't forget.

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,951
Let's begin.

70
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,828
You'll hit me?

71
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,963
-You get nothing! It's a goblin card.
-That's a bonus card.

72
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,090
Why are you taking mine?

73
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,509
-It's your congratulatory gift to me.
-That's mine...

74
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,888
Wait. It's obvious that I should
keep going right now,

75
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,473
but I'll stop here since I pity you. Stop.

76
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,475
-Pity me?
-That's ten points and a pibak.

77
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,186
That's double the score.
I should hit you 20 times, but

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,188
-I'll go easy and hit you twice.
-Why 20?

79
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,273
Look, this is a pibak.

80
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,025
-Is that double the score?
-Yes.

81
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,152
You should've explained that to me.

82
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,194
I'll just hit you twice.

83
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,197
It won't be fun if I go easy on you

84
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,408
-since we're dating or something.
-How could this happen...

85
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,874
Did that hurt bad?

86
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,802
This is a bomb. One, two, and three.

87
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,637
There! I win.

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,399
I'll stack these up here.

89
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,161
I've boosted my sugar level.
Let's start again.

90
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,623
Let's stop now.

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,416
This isn't fun at all.

92
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,513
It isn't fun?

93
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,560
Now that I think of it,
it feels a bit fun.

94
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
How many times was it?

95
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,857
I think it was five times.

96
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,443
-Five times?
-Didn't you score 50 points?

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,575
Isn't this fun? Do you want to play again?

98
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,182
Isn't it beautiful?

99
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,228
This is nice.

100
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,176
I saw you, so I should go back now.

101
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,972
I'm all recharged now.

102
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,642
I'm sorry for waking you up.
You should go back inside.

103
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,322
Ju-hyeok, can you order
some more coffee beans?

104
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,786
I'll order them. I won't make a mistake.

105
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,125
All right.

106
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,878
I entrusted my ex-husband with my life.

107
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,005
So I can surely entrust you with this.

108
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,674
Go ahead and make whatever order you want.

109
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,017
My beautiful friend, Seon-ju.

110
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,727
Look who's here.

111
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,563
It's my friend, Duk-mi,
who's busy dating a guy.

112
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,525
But my fangirl mate always comes
before my soulmate. Here.

113
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,486
What's this?

114
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,029
My gosh.

115
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,742
You're on the right track. When you
can't spend time with your friend,

116
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,869
you should at least spend money.

117
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,747
Thank you.

118
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,584
Don't ruin your health
just because you're upset.

119
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,795
You need to eat well at times like this.

120
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,713
-Aren't I the best?
-Yes.

121
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,050
How about you? Are you comfortable
now that he knows you're a fangirl?

122
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,971
By the way, did you make up
with your husband?

123
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,436
To be honest, I feel sorry

124
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,146
because I feel like I made you worry.

125
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,024
There's no need for you to feel sorry.

126
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,403
I'll make him live

127
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,489
the rest of his life walking on eggshells.

128
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,457
You should forgive him.

129
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,585
It was wrong of him to steal
those files without telling us.

130
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,337
But he didn't make up anything
for the show,

131
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,423
and we do hold responsibility
for making it seem like

132
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,174
The Road to Si-an
was stalking a normal person.

133
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,885
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

134
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,929
When it comes to a relationship,

135
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,056
there are things
that can't be resolved with logic.

136
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,309
This is a matter of emotion.

137
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,522
I agree.

138
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,941
I'd like an iced...

139
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,695
Americano.

140
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,827
Are you on your way to work?

141
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,746
-Yes.
-Eun-gi, an iced Americano?

142
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,914
Yes.

143
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,045
I heard it's going to rain today.
Did you bring an umbrella?

144
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,548
An umbrella? I have one at the office.

145
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,218
-That's a relief.
-Right.

146
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,228
Look at the time. I should get going now.

147
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,230
-See you.
-Bye.

148
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,235
Eun-gi.

149
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,071
-Did you--
-I told her

150
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,823
that I like her.

151
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,242
You're crazy!

152
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,994
What were you thinking?

153
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,581
I couldn't just keep it a secret forever.

154
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,043
What are we going to do?

155
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,275
Ms. Sung.

156
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,988
I'm sorry. I'm a little late, aren't I?
Did the meeting begin?

157
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,157
-Not everyone's here yet.
-Including Hyo-jin?

158
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,742
I'm here.

159
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,623
Ms. Sung, you should bring Director Gold.

160
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,584
As for you, Hyo-jin, give me that
and follow me.

161
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,919
Why?

162
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,720
Director Gold.

163
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,689
Director Gold.

164
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,233
GO-STOP RULES

165
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,824
Isn't it working hours right now?

166
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,953
I think I got scammed yesterday.

167
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,079
So I was just checking.

168
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,708
Scammed? I taught you
what you needed to know as a beginner.

169
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,794
But you didn't teach me
the most important thing.

170
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,004
And what's that?

171
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,881
The order of discarding the cards.

172
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,091
You weren't exactly on that level.

173
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,759
I'll give you an in-depth lesson
next time.

174
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,887
Now, let's go to the meeting.

175
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,768
How could you sleep so well
after hitting me that much?

176
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,729
Did it hurt a lot?

177
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,732
Did it really hurt a lot?

178
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,528
We'll make a small exhibition room
like this

179
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,573
and display paintings inside.

180
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,534
We could also add a small sofa

181
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,954
or other household appliances like a TV.

182
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,541
My own mini art gallery.

183
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,377
-It's cute.
-It's not bad.

184
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,881
Did you explain this
to the artists and collectors?

185
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,051
We sent them the proposal,
and we received positive responses.

186
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,970
Talk to the designer and make
the packaging a bit more simple.

187
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,806
And see if you can use magnets
for the paintings

188
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,433
instead of inserting them like that.

189
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,810
-The unit price for the minimum--
-Does that mean

190
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,688
we're really going to sell this
at our museum?

191
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,733
Don't look forward to its sales.

192
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,110
-Products like this--
-I think it'll get sold out.

193
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,571
I'll make a reservation in advance.

194
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,574
I'll make sure all the products
get sold out. Don't worry.

195
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,826
It'll be better to decide
the size of the product

196
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,580
and the miniature furniture
after you survey the potential clients.

197
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,165
Okay.

198
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,502
How are things going
with the special exhibition?

199
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,504
We finished editing the catalog design,

200
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,048
and we'll be getting our first draft
from the printing house.

201
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,217
-What about the press release?
-We're still writing it.

202
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,053
And we're doing a second edit
for the magazine ad.

203
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,182
Cheum's fifth-anniversary exhibition
is nearing.

204
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,811
I know you're all busy,
but please double-check everything

205
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,146
so that nothing goes wrong.

206
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,065
That's it for today.

207
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,110
The upcoming closing day
will be our last chance to take a break.

208
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,113
-What are you doing that day?
-I'm going to an orphanage.

209
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,781
I do volunteer work, teaching art to kids.

210
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,241
You do volunteer work at an orphanage?

211
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,993
What's with that weird tone?

212
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,454
No, it's just that it really suits you.

213
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,541
Of course, I like resting on my day off.

214
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,961
But it really makes me feel great
once I do it.

215
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,796
Do you go alone? It must be hard.

216
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,548
Then would you like to join me?

217
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,591
-Sure, I'll join you.
-Really?

218
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,260
What about you, Ms. Sung?

219
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,763
-Sure.
-Then we should all go together.

220
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,265
Me too?

221
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,976
Right, sure.

222
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,020
This is good.

223
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,813
Let me tell you about Duk-mi.

224
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,024
She kept denying it,

225
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,901
but it turns out she really was
dating Director Gold.

226
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,029
-Really?
-Yes.

227
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,991
I thought she was only good at
chasing K-pop idols,

228
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,577
but I guess it helped her set
high standards when it comes to men.

229
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,872
He's handsome, competent, and very polite.

230
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,500
It made me look at Duk-mi differently.

231
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,298
Was I showing off too much?

232
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,759
Don't you worry, though.

233
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,012
Eun-gi will meet a nice young lady
when the time is right.

234
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,930
We both know he's a decent young man.

235
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,269
You know what they say.

236
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,397
It's the fathers-in-law
that dote on their daughters-in-law.

237
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,816
When Eun-gi brings home someone, I'll--

238
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,029
I'd rather you don't do anything
and polish your rocks instead.

239
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,114
That's the trend for fathers-in-law
these days.

240
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,159
DUK-MI, DID YOU GET OFF WORK?
WHEN WILL YOU COME HOME?

241
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,168
Eun-gi!

242
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,295
Editor Nam,

243
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,422
what are you doing here?

244
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,509
Aren't you sick and tired of working out?

245
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,886
You're sweating like a pig
even until this hour.

246
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,389
How can an athlete
be sick and tired of training?

247
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,475
Would you like to take a walk
with your mom?

248
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,602
Sure thing.

249
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,521
Just wait a second.
Let me take a shower first.

250
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,856
All right.

251
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,739
I didn't know you were this tall.

252
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,742
My neck will go stiff
from looking up at you.

253
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,912
Here. Look at me all you want.

254
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,373
Gosh.

255
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,917
It's hard, isn't it?

256
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,296
-What is?
-Unrequited love.

257
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,716
Yeong-suk told me
about Duk-mi and Director Gold.

258
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,342
Why don't we sit down?

259
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,349
I should've congratulated her

260
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,934
and said I was happy for them.

261
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,686
But I couldn't.

262
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:53,442
All I could think about
was how heartbroken my son would be.

263
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,446
-Mom--
-I don't want you to suffer.

264
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,952
Was it hard for you too

265
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,288
when you were with Dad?

266
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,791
Of course.

267
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,295
It was as if I was
the only one in the relationship.

268
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,380
I must've been insane back then.

269
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,135
Still, I don't regret any of it

270
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
since I had you in the end.

271
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,349
Your son is quite a catch, right?

272
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,852
Yes, and that's why
I don't want to lose him to anyone.

273
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,565
Son,

274
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,611
meet someone you love

275
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,905
that loves you back.

276
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,825
That's all I want for you.

277
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,581
Why is it so hard

278
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,292
to like someone?

279
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,211
I can't

280
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,380
help the way I feel.

281
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,424
I've...

282
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,927
competed in countless competitions before,

283
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,806
but none have been this painful.

284
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,146
I may not be much, but you still have me.

285
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,564
Don't forget that.

286
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,483
Of course.

287
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,943
Let's get going.

288
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,661
What's all this?

289
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,997
Colored pencils, chalk pastels,
crayons, felt tip pens,

290
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,416
paint, paper, scissors...

291
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,418
You prepared all of this yourself?

292
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,754
I'm already grateful for you
agreeing to join me.

293
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,720
-Is Hyo-jin coming, too?
-I didn't know.

294
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,432
Hello.

295
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,022
-What's all this?
-Let me take that.

296
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,859
White Ocean CDs.

297
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,695
I'm going to make these children fans.

298
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,324
Won't Director Gold be joining us?

299
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,576
He's been friendly lately,
so I thought he'd come.

300
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,744
Did you two break up?

301
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,997
-Hyo-jin!
-Sorry. It's a force of habit.

302
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,168
He was quite busy this week.

303
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,627
He'll need the day off.

304
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,385
Director Gold?

305
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,138
Sorry I'm late.
I had something to take care of.

306
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,641
Ms. Sung, will you be riding with him?

307
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,894
All right.

308
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,522
-Let's hit the road then.
-Let's go.

309
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,788
You should've told me you were coming.

310
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,831
I wanted to see
the surprised look on your face.

311
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,336
What are all these stuffed animals for?

312
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,553
I'm going to an orphanage.
I do volunteer work teaching art to kids.

313
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,193
Hi, Ryan.

314
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,822
-Mr. Cha?
-I told you to address me casually.

315
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,700
I don't see Ms. Sung today.

316
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,204
She went to an orphanage
to do volunteer work.

317
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,705
An orphanage? That's great.

318
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,290
Hold on a second.

319
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,381
There are stuffed animals from my fans

320
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,841
that I haven't been able to donate yet.

321
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,843
Could you take them with you?

322
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,766
My goodness. Isn't Si-an an angel?

323
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,851
Hold on.

324
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,769
I'm the one who brought them here.

325
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,522
Good job, driver.

326
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,691
Driver?

327
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,943
Driver, let's go.

328
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,032
Yes, ma'am.
Your driver will start driving.

329
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,639
-Are you done with that?
-Look at this.

330
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,226
-A little bit more.
-Come here.

331
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,230
Kids, look at me!

332
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,650
Great job. Kids, from now on,

333
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,278
we're going to do something really fun.

334
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,323
To do that, you need to
sit down in your seats.

335
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,201
Can you sit down in your seats for me?

336
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,203
-Yes!
-Yes!

337
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,788
Let's begin!

338
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,416
-Over here!
-Defense!

339
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,709
Jun-seok!

340
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,341
That way!

341
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,219
Good job!

342
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,307
Shoot the ball!

343
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,393
-Over here.
-Pass it!

344
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,729
-I'm right here.
-Over here.

345
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,980
Shoot it!

346
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,024
Shoot!

347
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,756
Director Gold!

348
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,092
-Join us!
-Come here.

349
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,969
-Let's play.
-Come on.

350
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,012
Come on, Director Gold!

351
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,889
-Come on!
-Hurry!

352
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,641
Come join us!

353
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,693
But why do you provide
art education like this?

354
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,196
Isn't it better to just
support them financially?

355
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,243
Does it make a difference
if they learn about art?

356
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,870
It's not like they can buy a painting.

357
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,915
Why?

358
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,126
Was it a rude question?

359
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,338
Hyo-jin, did you

360
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,800
fall in love with Cha Si-an
at first sight?

361
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,218
Yes, of course.

362
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,428
Then,

363
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,556
if you were told to go back to
before you knew Cha Si-an

364
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,641
and forget everything, could you do it?

365
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,518
-Never.
-Why not?

366
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,854
Even without Cha Si-an, you can eat well,

367
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,731
go to nice places, and do happy things--

368
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,649
How could I forget my Si-an?

369
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,153
I can never forget him.
He's stuck in my heart for life.

370
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,073
Do you know how happy I became
thanks to my Si-an?

371
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,078
I think art is similar to that.

372
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,706
Of course, financial support is important.

373
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,459
They can live happily even without art.

374
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,668
However,

375
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,422
if we give them a chance to
become familiar with art like this,

376
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,257
and let them learn the beauty

377
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,634
that comes from drawing
and coloring things,

378
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,219
their lives will become more abundant

379
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,513
and full of happiness.

380
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,141
That's what I believe.

381
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,144
I'm living like that right now, too.

382
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,623
-Pass!
-Go catch him!

383
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,464
-I'm passing it to you!
-Hey!

384
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,257
Over here!

385
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,514
Good job.

386
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,643
Rock-paper-scissors.

387
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,811
Rock-paper-scissors.

388
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,866
Kids, do you see
this pretty teacher right here?

389
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,576
-Yes.
-Yes.

390
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,037
From now on, we will draw

391
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,872
this pretty teacher's face

392
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,791
and exhibit them for everyone to see.

393
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,961
We will look at how
we each express the same person

394
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,297
in our own different ways,
and share our opinions.

395
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,590
Can you do that?

396
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,759
-Yes!
-Yes!

397
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,553
I will help you, too.

398
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,013
Get ready, start!

399
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,141
Hang in there.

400
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,147
Director Gold.

401
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,775
If you want to draw your
girlfriend too, here you go.

402
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,743
Good luck.

403
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,061
Teacher, don't move.

404
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,646
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,777
You're not supposed to move.

406
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,514
Doesn't it look the same?

407
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,978
It looks exactly like her.

408
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,237
It's you, Duk-mi.

409
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,907
Teacher, don't move.

410
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,033
I'm sorry.

411
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,286
Shall I draw your face, too?

412
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,204
What?

413
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,164
Me?

414
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,758
Give me a crayon.

415
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,676
Okay.

416
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,684
Can you make my eyes a little bigger?

417
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,104
What's next?

418
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,439
I need a red crayon.

419
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,696
Cheeks.

420
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,991
All right. Take the picture.

421
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,369
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

422
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,705
Click. Great job.

423
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,998
-Great job.
-Good job.

424
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,541
-Is Gyu-bin next?
-Gyu-bin, smile.

425
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,459
One, two, three.

426
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,302
-Look at that pretty lady.
-One,

427
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,553
two, three.

428
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,971
Cheese.

429
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,098
One more time.

430
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,267
Smile brightly.

431
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,774
One, two, three.

432
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,777
Good.

433
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,827
You want me to draw your hand?

434
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,995
Yes.

435
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,708
Not a sketch, but you want me
to draw along your hand?

436
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,959
Yes.

437
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,256
I'm Ryan Gold.

438
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,257
I know.

439
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,094
Why? I like this better. It's cuter.

440
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,432
Okay, fine.

441
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,244
Let me choose another color.

442
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,166
Just like this.

443
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,886
There we go.

444
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,579
It's all done now.

445
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,507
Gosh, even my hands are pretty.
Don't you agree?

446
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,722
Now that we're done with mine,
it's time to draw yours.

447
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,140
I'll draw it for you.

448
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,101
I'll use light blue.
It was already decided from the start.

449
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,688
There.

450
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,317
Your hand is really pretty.

451
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,117
There we go.

452
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,539
Isn't it like a piece of art?

453
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,625
It's nice.

454
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,794
How about displaying it
at Mono Art Gallery?

455
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll think about it.

456
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,507
Mister.

457
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,929
Mister, what's your name?

458
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,597
Ryan Gold.

459
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,265
Ryan Gold?

460
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,728
It sounds so weird.
Don't you have a Korean name?

461
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,830
RYAN

462
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,589
You must be happy to be loved.

463
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,842
Yes.

464
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:41,055
RYAN

465
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,188
Mister, I hope you come again.

466
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,567
Goodbye.

467
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,112
Thank you.

468
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,324
Let's go.

469
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,453
I want to ride in the nice car, too.

470
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,873
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

471
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,833
-See you tomorrow.
-Just ride what you rode before.

472
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,626
Let's go.

473
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,378
Should we go, too?

474
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,675
We should sit where we sat
on our way here.

475
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,637
Okay.

476
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,699
Put these on.

477
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,496
If I wear these,
you won't be able to focus on driving.

478
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,833
I look amazing in sunglasses.

479
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,755
How do I look?

480
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:03,054
To be honest,
I didn't think you'd come today.

481
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,640
That's why I never mentioned it to you.

482
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,850
I'm glad I came.

483
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,647
Now that I made happy memories
with someone I like,

484
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,484
I don't hate that place
as much as I used to.

485
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,572
-You should face the front now.
-I don't want to.

486
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,493
-Look at the scenery.
-I like what I'm seeing.

487
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,330
This art piece was made in 1987.

488
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,581
I want it.

489
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,509
Mister, what's your name?

490
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,135
It sounds so weird.

491
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,179
Don't you have a Korean name?

492
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,407
The kids seemed to like you a lot.

493
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,825
Are you jealous?

494
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,994
Do you want me all to yourself?

495
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,623
Let me tell you something.

496
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,042
Remember when we first met
at the auction house?

497
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,712
When you asked if I wanted you,

498
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,630
I thought you were crazy.

499
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,674
I already heard.

500
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,597
Director Gold.

501
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,643
Do you really not remember
your Korean name?

502
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,858
To be honest,
it feels like a stranger's name.

503
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,069
I never really liked that name.

504
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,656
So it feels like it belongs
to someone else.

505
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,830
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
-Yun-jae.

506
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,836
Heo Yun-jae.

507
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,713
Heo Yun-jae?

508
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,634
I'm going to like that name

509
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,554
because it's the name of the man I like.

510
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,768
Hi, Heo Yun-jae.

511
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,408
When are you going to let go of my hand?

512
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,077
I'm not the one holding onto you.

513
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,081
Then I guess
I should be the one to let go.

514
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,334
One,

515
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,044
two...

516
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,089
Do you want to have dinner here?
It'll be a handmade meal.

517
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,175
In order to make the dough,
you need flour.

518
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,722
-Let's see.
-Did I do it properly?

519
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,475
How long do we need to leave it to rest?

520
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,810
For about 30 to 40 minutes.

521
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,478
What are we going to do for 30 minutes?

522
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,730
What do you want to do?

523
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,195
Your neck is really red.

524
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,080
This is yours.

525
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,581
Will this do?

526
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,220
We need to eat this.

527
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,347
Let's have it later.

528
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,059
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

529
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,606
MS. DUK-MI

530
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,673
What was that?

531
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,404
Goodnight, Duk-mi.

532
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,869
Goodnight,

533
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,455
Yun-jae.

534
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,084
GOODNIGHT, YUN-JAE

535
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,673
Heo Yun-jae.

536
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,925
It's a pretty name.

537
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,016
FIND MISSING CHILDREN

538
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,021
FIND MISSING CHILDREN

539
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,402
SEARCH MISSING CHILD: HEO YUN-JAE
MISSING IN 1993

540
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,904
NO SEARCH RESULTS FOUND. SEARCH AGAIN.

541
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,001
Hello?

542
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,961
A drunk lady?

543
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,922
With short hair?

544
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,302
Sure. Where are you exactly?

545
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,107
-Don't drink too much.
-Sure.

546
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,365
It's Mr. Pathetic.

547
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,660
What did I tell you?

548
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,662
You were right.

549
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,748
Nam Eun-gi, the judo medalist.

550
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,375
See? I told you I knew him.

551
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,423
-You said she was Lee Seon-ju.
-Did I?

552
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,593
I only said she was drunk
and had short hair.

553
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,889
-What is all this?
-Well,

554
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,725
he said he was a fan of yours,

555
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,727
so I told him I knew you.

556
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,187
But he wouldn't believe me.

557
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,439
I'm a fan, Mr. Nam.

558
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,526
Could I perhaps get your autograph?

559
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,820
How about a shoulder throw instead?

560
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,656
That's not necessary.

561
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,991
I'd be more than satisfied
with an autograph.

562
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,624
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

563
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,959
I'm annoying, aren't I?

564
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,128
So you know!

565
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,048
I was wondering
if I should tell you or not.

566
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,550
Truth be told,

567
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,261
I don't have any friends.

568
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,514
I have nobody to have a drink with.

569
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,600
Actually, I have just one friend.

570
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,894
No.

571
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,648
There's someone I have
to pretend to be friends with,

572
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:57,528
but it's getting too hard
to keep faking it.

573
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,462
Are we friends now, then?

574
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,676
Yes, whatever.
It's just for today, though.

575
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,556
I can tell that you'll be
an annoying friend.

576
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,892
You're a good judge of character.

577
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,898
So you told her how you felt?

578
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,652
That's brave of you.

579
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,946
I just gave up altogether.

580
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,949
Why?

581
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,953
I've known Ryan for ten years,

582
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,124
but I saw expressions
that I've never seen before.

583
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,130
I could tell that he truly liked her.

584
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,424
It was that obvious.

585
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,802
All throughout my life,

586
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,430
I was able to get everything I wanted.

587
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,559
I feel like there's only one thing
I can do at this point.

588
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,524
It's to move on.

589
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,405
I want Ryan to at least remain
as a friend in my life.

590
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,100
Mr. Pathetic!

591
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,394
Yes, that's my name,

592
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,522
so tell me where you live.

593
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,400
Would you like to go there?

594
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,696
You've got to be kidding me.

595
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,661
I was a drunken nuisance.

596
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,039
Why am I passionate even
when it comes to drinking?

597
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,041
I'm a passionate drunk, too.

598
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,628
You've got to be kidding me.

599
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,133
Attention!

600
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,847
Tigers are way stronger than lions.

601
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,525
CHOIKANG JUDO

602
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,748
I'll be your drinking buddy sometimes,

603
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,500
but I'm not bar-hopping with you.

604
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,463
Hyo-jin.

605
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,133
The survey you did was quite good,

606
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,260
but the questions seem
a little too direct.

607
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,511
Which ones?

608
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,722
-All of them.
-Yes, Professor.

609
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,851
Is the restoration complete?

610
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,105
Yes, you can send it to us directly.

611
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,899
I've never heard you this excited before.

612
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,069
Is there a story behind this painting?

613
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,155
Yes, a good one too.

614
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,492
Professor, I'll come and see you
in person next week.

615
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,161
Thank you so much.

616
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,413
Sure.

617
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,001
The restoration for the piece you found
the other day is complete?

618
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,878
It didn't take as long as I expected.

619
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,088
Professor Yang is the best.

620
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,634
Aren't you curious about the painter?

621
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,761
We all know who it is. It's Lee Sol.

622
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,471
He doesn't mean it like that.

623
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,724
I've been doing some research
for the exhibition

624
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,561
but nothing except for the painter's name
seems to be known to the public.

625
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,814
Many will be dying to know more
about the painter after the exhibition.

626
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:07,152
Right? The visionary artist
who won Cha Si-an's heart.

627
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,613
I wonder who it is.

628
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,490
I'm curious, too.

629
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:15,035
Anyway, I'll tell Director Gold
that the restoration is complete.

630
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,245
He'll love to hear the news.

631
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,372
-I know.
-He sure will.

632
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,310
I thank you in advance, Professor.

633
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:54,074
Lee Sol's painting
has been fully restored.

634
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,200
When can I see it?

635
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,618
He just sent it our way.

636
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,705
I'll make sure you get to see it
before it's put in storage.

637
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,581
Thank you.

638
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,950
Director Eom?

639
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,455
I'm the head director
of TK Cultural Foundation.

640
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,542
Could Head Director Eom

641
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,502
have a word with you?

642
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,902
Congratulations, Head Director Eom.

643
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,489
In order to have a conversation
with you, Mr. Gold,

644
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,743
I felt like I needed the right
or proper qualification.

645
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,746
I guess you have an unusual way
of having a conversation.

646
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,789
Well,

647
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,874
actually...

648
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,960
I don't like words going back and forth.

649
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,546
I'll just do the talking,

650
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,091
so you can just listen, Mr. Gold.

651
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,136
Cheum's fifth-anniversary exhibition,

652
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,389
the Celebrity Collectors' Exhibition.

653
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,892
I want you to cancel it.

654
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,605
Head Director Eom...

655
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,942
-Mom.
-Hyo-jin?

656
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,861
I came up with this item...

657
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,572
I mean, museum merchandise.

658
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,491
Oh, I see.

659
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,077
You may leave. And Hyo-jin,

660
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,122
you're not someone who should be
making something like that.

661
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,167
You will be leading TK Corporation--

662
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,794
You don't even care about me.

663
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,011
As long as you give me
a credit card, I don't bother you

664
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,847
and do everything you say.

665
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,558
Hyo-jin?

666
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,059
Why do you

667
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,936
never ask me?

668
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,897
What I like

669
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,358
or what I want to do.

670
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,819
Why aren't you even curious?

671
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,405
I get curious about things I like.

672
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,200
Hyo-jin?

673
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,995
Is there anything that

674
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,500
I don't know about you?

675
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,837
I made this.

676
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,548
Ms. Sung let me

677
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,593
do something that I'm good at,

678
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,470
Ms. Yu helped me,

679
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,598
Yu-seop supported me,

680
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,100
and Director Gold...

681
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,149
Anyway, I want to continue doing this.

682
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,153
It's not because of Cha Si-an.
It's because I like it.

683
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,034
Nevertheless,

684
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,037
I don't condone you liking idols.

685
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,005
What does this mean, Hyo-jin?

686
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,590
Please let us continue

687
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,508
with the special exhibition.

688
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,386
I want to keep working on this
and finish it.

689
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,388
If not...

690
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,231
There will be no one left

691
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,400
beside you.

692
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,361
Including me.

693
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,622
What is going on?

694
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,124
There's no parent in this world
who can win over their child.

695
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,890
Will we be able to hold
the special exhibition?

696
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,728
Director Eom, are you okay?

697
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,064
I feel so upset.

698
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,456
Director Gold.

699
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,252
Don't you think it will all work out?

700
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,845
Oh, my. It's Si-an.

701
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,811
Ms. Sung, aren't you going home?

702
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,146
You can go first.

703
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,231
What time do you think
Director Gold will go?

704
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,775
I have to store Lee Sol's painting.

705
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,277
I'll do that.
You can go home too, Yu-seop.

706
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,320
Can I?

707
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,155
All right, then. Goodnight.

708
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,490
I'll see you tomorrow.

709
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,116
-Good job today.
-Thank you.

710
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,502
How about a drink?

711
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,045
Didn't you see me earlier?

712
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,923
I need to go home
for the last battle with my mom.

713
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,718
Hyo-jin, I really admire you. Good luck.

714
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,930
Do you even know how to ride a bus?

715
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,935
Let's go. I'll teach you.

716
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,623
Yes, Mr. Park.

717
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,875
I just arrived and I'm on my way.

718
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,669
Si-an doesn't know yet, right?

719
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,005
Okay.

720
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,267
I don't feel like eating.

721
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,522
Cha Si-an.

722
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,150
Mom?

723
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,819
You should eat before you work.

724
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,780
Mom, how did you come all the way here?

725
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,619
My son. Why did you lose so much weight?

726
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,372
When did you come?
If I knew, I would've picked you up.

727
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,124
I knew you were busy.

728
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,002
You look so cool on TV,
but you're still a baby.

729
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,881
-My baby Si-an.
-I missed you so much.

730
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,467
Come here. Did you miss me?

731
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,906
Director Gold.

732
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,455
Were you looking at that painting?

733
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,376
A girl I know stares at paintings
when she has a tough day.

734
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,129
That's why.

735
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,131
What girl?

736
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,679
I'm so glad we can continue with
the special exhibition.

737
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,932
Yes.

738
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,684
I'm glad, too.

739
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,898
I have

740
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,817
a question to ask you.

741
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,028
I heard that if you're curious
about someone,

742
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,365
it means that you like that person.

743
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,330
You own two of Lee Sol's paintings.

744
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,124
When did you first see it?

745
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,922
Three years ago,

746
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,176
at a gallery in New York.

747
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,110
Since then,

748
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,240
I wasn't able to draw.

749
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,787
I can't

750
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,916
draw anymore.

751
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,795
You know that, right?

752
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,470
At first, I thought it was
the Stendhal syndrome.

753
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,515
I thought I'd be okay soon.

754
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,645
I pestered my friend
who's a doctor for three years,

755
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,105
but he couldn't find a cure.

756
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,569
-So--
-So I returned to this painting.

757
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,656
Since it all started from
Lee Sol's painting,

758
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,035
I thought I might find an answer

759
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,120
if I collect all of her works.

760
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,710
But...

761
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,964
I already saw that painting before.

762
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,219
Not three years ago,

763
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,806
but a very long time ago.

764
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,022
When I was little.

765
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,486
If it was when you were little...

766
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,865
Before I became Ryan.

767
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,410
When I was Heo Yun-jae.

768
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,795
I saw someone painting that.

769
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,675
You saw someone painting it?

770
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,220
Lee Sol's painting?

771
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,600
Lee Sol.

772
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,731
She's probably someone I know.

773
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,362
Mom, don't get too startled
when we get home.

774
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,698
Is there something that might startle me?

775
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,576
I'm collecting paintings
for an art exhibition.

776
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:47,954
Paintings?

777
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,790
All the paintings you drew

778
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,251
as Lee Sol.

779
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,177
She's probably

780
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,642
my mom.

781
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,321
Isn't it interesting?

782
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,743
I can't remember the face
of the person who painted it,

783
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,579
but I remember the painting.

784
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,707
Is that why that happened
when you saw the painting?

785
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,168
I'm okay.

786
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,464
No, you're not.

787
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,346
Even if you say you're okay,

788
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,974
your heart isn't.

789
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,103
It can't be okay.

790
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,064
