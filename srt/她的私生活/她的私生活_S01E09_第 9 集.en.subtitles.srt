1
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,041
But I think

2
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,088
we should end our fake relationship now.

3
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,469
I was thinking of ending
the fake relationship too.

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,182
I sincerely thank you for your help.

5
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,476
Why did she sound like it was the end?

6
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,494
SUNG DUK-MI

7
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,580
Tomorrow.

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,707
I'll see her tomorrow at work.

9
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,823
Why am I waiting for his call
after saying that to him?

10
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,168
Damn morning.

11
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,109
I really don't want to go to work today.

12
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,331
CALL HISTORY

13
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
THE END
SUNG DUK-MI

14
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,885
THE END
SUNG DUK-MI

15
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,766
What is up with her now?

16
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,694
Seon-ju, can I get an iced Americano?

17
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,988
Did something happen between you and Lion?

18
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,658
No, nothing happened. Why?

19
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,036
Then what does this mean?

20
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,748
Did you tell him how you feel?

21
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,625
I told you not to do it
until you were certain.

22
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,210
I didn't tell him.

23
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,464
It ended before I had a chance.

24
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,717
Lion said he wanted to end
the fake relationship.

25
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,885
Lion said that?

26
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,762
Yes.

27
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,766
-So what did you say to him?
-What else can I say?

28
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,686
I said okay and told him we should end it.

29
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,397
-Nice and simple.
-What is that?

30
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,192
You didn't tell him how you feel
and your fake relationship is over too?

31
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,904
Why was he nice to you when
he didn't like you in the first place?

32
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,615
Isn't that illegal these days?

33
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,201
Right?

34
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,788
Why did he do this that time then?

35
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,457
Was he trying to stamp his thumbprint
on my lips or what?

36
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,334
That jerk.

37
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,760
That jerk. Why does he have
such a nice voice though?

38
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,762
And what is wrong with those eyes?

39
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,555
Right. He should be prosecuted.

40
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,808
-He deserves to get life in prison.
-You're right.

41
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,895
It feels good talking to you like this.

42
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,563
I feel much better.

43
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,944
-Hey, it's Lion!
-What?

44
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,368
Why are you hiding?
You're going to see him at work anyway.

45
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,078
I don't have the courage to see him yet.

46
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,961
-Good morning.
-You must be having a good morning.

47
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,046
-Have you--
-Have I what?

48
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,010
-Did Ms. Sung...
-That's not on the menu.

49
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,641
Okay, then.

50
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,687
-Can I have some condensed milk with--
-Gosh, we're out of condensed milk.

51
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,606
Then can I have some warm milk?

52
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,401
Oh, gosh. We're out of milk too.

53
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,864
Then what do you have?

54
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,032
Coffee.

55
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,663
-Do you want coffee?
-No, thank you.

56
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,513
I'm sure it was Ms. Sung.

57
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,975
Why would she lie?

58
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,160
He's gone.

59
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,958
Why am I so pathetic?

60
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,047
Duk-mi, don't change your profile picture
or your status

61
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,423
for the time being.

62
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,967
And don't even log on
to your social media either.

63
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,219
Even my social media?

64
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,346
You might make a scene
when you start being a fangirl,

65
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,597
but what do you do when you stop?

66
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,265
You keep it quiet.

67
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,851
Just stay quiet and focus on work, okay?

68
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay.

69
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,275
That jerk.

70
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,928
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

71
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,764
I thought
we could have breakfast together.

72
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,934
No, I'm not hungry. What are you here for?

73
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,645
The day just began,
and you're being really mean.

74
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,856
Did you seriously tell her how you feel?

75
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,193
If you're not here to talk about work,
you should leave.

76
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,988
Fine, let's talk about work then.

77
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,367
-Ms. Sung, what are you doing?
-Yes?

78
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,035
Why are you so startled?

79
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,250
It's Director Gold.

80
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,630
Hello.

81
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,097
Hello, Ms. Choi. Hello, Director Gold.

82
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,392
I have a lot of work to get done,
so I'll see you inside.

83
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,787
Yes, breaking up is the same
as stop being a fangirl.

84
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,039
Let's end it quietly.

85
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,208
Let's stay quiet
and focus on work for a while.

86
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,378
Ryan no longer wants to carry on
with the fake relationship.

87
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,341
That means you really need my help.

88
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,300
I really

89
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,053
need your help, Da-in.

90
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,765
Focus on work.

91
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,063
What happened?

92
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,774
You know anything?

93
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,907
Ms. Sung.

94
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,536
Are you busy right now?

95
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,747
As you can see, I'm a little busy.

96
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,707
Do you need me to do something,

97
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,459
Director Gold?

98
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,088
Never mind.

99
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,993
Doesn't it seem like Ms. Sung
and Director Gold had a fight?

100
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,123
But Ms. Sung seemed fine yesterday
up until she left to meet Ms. Choi.

101
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,083
You're right.

102
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,168
I missed you, Ryan.

103
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,462
-You said you missed me too.
-Three...

104
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,550
-What is it?
-It's a girl problem.

105
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,801
A girl problem?

106
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,138
Ms. Choi Da-in.

107
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,349
I have a lot of work to get done,
so I'll see you inside.

108
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,104
They must've had a fight
because of Director Gold.

109
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,023
Gosh, does that mean Ms. Sung lost?

110
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,400
It seems that way.

111
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,492
Ms. Lee, about renting Mr. Ahn's work
from Ullim Art Gallery--

112
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,662
I'll update you on that via email.

113
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,708
I'm so disappointed in you, Director Gold!

114
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,380
Mr. Kim, about the storehouse--

115
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,257
I'll update you on that via email as well.

116
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,761
Director Gold,
you're a disgrace to all men.

117
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,434
Ms. Kim?

118
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,062
-I'll also send you an email--
-Cha Si-an's

119
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:55,983
special exhibition.

120
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,334
They think I dumped her?

121
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,170
They think you cheated on her.

122
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,796
Me?

123
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,677
Did Ms. Sung say that?

124
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,555
No, they just guessed.

125
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
They just guessed?

126
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,644
Why did you not say anything?

127
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,688
You know everything
because you kept stalking me.

128
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,067
Yes, I know you didn't cheat.

129
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,027
-But...
-But?

130
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,570
Why would I help you

131
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,156
when you even once threatened to sue me?

132
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,283
I'm glad you're going through this.

133
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,541
Why is she acting like she got dumped
when she dumped me?

134
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,627
No, wait.

135
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,338
How could I get dumped
when I didn't even go out with her?

136
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,094
I need to set things straight.

137
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,983
If you have nothing to say,
I'll get going.

138
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,025
Ms. Sung.

139
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,073
What did you mean
by what you said yesterday?

140
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,952
I meant what I said.

141
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,036
Then does that mean

142
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,372
you want to end

143
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,082
our fake relationship?

144
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,127
We can't go on.
After all, it was all fake.

145
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,130
"After all, it was all fake"?

146
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,506
You also...

147
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,634
You even said so yourself.

148
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,846
You said CUPATCH is gone
and that Hyo-jin will be quitting soon.

149
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,307
-So we have no more reason to--
-Is that

150
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,975
the real reason?

151
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,939
Ms. Sung, I...

152
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,166
Okay.

153
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,337
Thanks for everything.

154
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,849
It was fake?

155
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
THE ROAD TO SI-AN
A NEW CHAT ROOM HAS BEEN MADE

156
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,446
LEAVE

157
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,366
The Road to Si-an, what do you think?

158
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,453
You don't like
where we decided to buy the cake?

159
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,871
Should we find another place?

160
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,420
No, let's stick to this one.

161
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,436
The lease for your car ended,
so you'll be given a new car.

162
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,354
We finished registering
the license plate number.

163
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,355
Thank you.

164
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,072
Did you decide on a theme for
the ballerina, Oh Yeong-hui's exhibition?

165
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,700
We're talking with her

166
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,202
about exhibiting photos and videos
that show the years of hard work

167
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,829
on a ballerina's body.

168
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,624
Isn't that theme too lazy?

169
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,461
It may not be her solo exhibition,

170
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,629
but it still doesn't seem much different

171
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,465
from previous exhibitions.

172
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,344
Showing a dramatic video
of Oh Yeong-hui's life as a ballerina

173
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,388
is already a very new attempt.

174
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,516
Don't you think you're being biased
by quickly judging the theme

175
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,518
without even looking into it in detail?

176
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,646
I didn't take you
to be such a biased person.

177
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,416
Why do we need to suffer
because of their breakup?

178
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,086
I feel as if I've been holding my breath
for 15 minutes.

179
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,546
I guess dating someone at work
is a bad thing.

180
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,424
I should tell my mom to put a ban on it.

181
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,304
I don't think that's right.

182
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:19,973
Right.

183
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,183
First of all...

184
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,229
Let's at least eat in peace.

185
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,898
I'll eat with Ms. Sung and Hyo-jin.

186
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,316
You can eat with Director Gold.

187
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,448
-Four portions?
-Go for it.

188
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,633
Why don't we...

189
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,699
Lion is sweet and generous to everyone.

190
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,200
It doesn't mean a thing.

191
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,207
It looks delicious.

192
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,877
Enjoy your food.

193
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,428
Gosh, he's adorable.

194
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,068
Cute or handsome.
Why can't he be just one of those things?

195
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,612
You greedy jerk.

196
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
Does he own this world or what?

197
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,742
Selfish jerk.

198
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,499
What?

199
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,421
I was only trying to hand you some.

200
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,010
I'm sorry if it seemed that way.

201
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,056
It's not...

202
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,486
I can't take this anymore.

203
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,446
They had all the fun while dating,

204
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,615
but their breakup
is making us walk on eggshells.

205
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,617
Can I take the day off?

206
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,827
The working environment is too stressful.

207
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,676
Did I make it hard on him?

208
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,554
It seems as though she's upset with me.

209
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,806
Ms. Sung.

210
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,599
Yes?

211
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,190
-Did I perhaps--
-Director Gold!

212
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,318
Mom? Dad?

213
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,449
-Hello.
-Hello, have you been well?

214
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,159
Yes, have you been well too?

215
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,121
Yes, we have been good thanks to you.

216
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,331
-Why are you here?
-Isn't it obvious?

217
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,041
We're here to see Director Gold.

218
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,628
I hope you haven't had lunch yet.

219
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,965
I packed you some food, you see.

220
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,216
We ate.

221
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,759
Already?

222
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,970
You should've called in advance.

223
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,807
Well, I thought you'd eat around noon.

224
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,934
You should go. Let me take you home.

225
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,645
-Come on.
-Director Gold, I'm sorry

226
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,814
for coming here unannounced.

227
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,357
Until next time then.

228
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
-Let's go.
-Take care.

229
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,527
Hurry.

230
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,280
Actually,

231
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,243
I'm still a little hungry.

232
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,874
Ms. Sung has a big appetite,
so I let her have most of it.

233
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,001
Is that so?

234
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
She's a bit obsessed with food.
She got it from her dad.

235
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,177
Let's go. The weather's nice,
so we'll think of it as a picnic.

236
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,720
Come on.

237
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,431
-Mom, where are you going?
-I bet he met her parents already.

238
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,308
Mom! Director Gold!

239
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,019
I don't think
they're aware of the breakup.

240
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,896
I'm staying here. I'm not going!

241
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,690
-Come on, Duk-mi.
-No, I'm staying!

242
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,568
This, I can't watch.

243
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,740
For you, I made gimbap
with tuna and mayonnaise

244
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,075
and gimbap with cheese.

245
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,787
-And this is Duk-mi's favorite--
-I'm not eating.

246
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,872
At least try one of them.

247
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,208
They came out deliciously today.

248
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,876
I'm stuffed as it is.

249
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,379
I'll have one instead.

250
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,759
Director Gold, that's...

251
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,054
Oh, no.

252
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,934
Do you like Cheongyang chilies too?

253
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,355
-Cheongyang chilies?
-Yes, hot pepper.

254
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,816
I added in a huge heap.

255
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,859
Cheongyang chilis?

256
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,198
It's delicious.

257
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,619
-Director Gold, are you crying?
-I'm not.

258
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,454
It's just delicious, that's all.

259
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,167
Here. It might soothe your tongue.

260
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,382
It's delicious.

261
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,102
I almost forgot.

262
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,895
I have something for you.

263
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,691
Here you go.

264
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,991
I made it myself.

265
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,492
It's a lion, just like you.

266
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,704
-Mom, his name is Ryan, not Lion.
-Thank you.

267
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,146
Why don't we take a picture
since we're all here?

268
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,939
Oh, please. Let's just go home.

269
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,776
You're right. What's the point
of taking a picture of my old face?

270
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,945
I now only need one for my funeral.

271
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,574
Why don't we take a photo
of my pretty mom today?

272
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,618
The trees look great,
let's take one in front of them.

273
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,995
-Come on.
-You cheeky girl.

274
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,672
I'll take another.

275
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,596
Director Gold, join us.

276
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,057
-Come on over here.
-Join us.

277
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,392
Excuse me. Can you take a photo of us?

278
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
-A picture?
-Yes.

279
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,355
-Sure.
-Here you go.

280
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,232
One, two, three.

281
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,027
Stand here.

282
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,613
Mom? What are you doing?

283
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,868
All right. One, two, three.

284
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,748
-Mom!
-Just take the photo already.

285
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,875
Duk-mi, flash a big smile.

286
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,920
Director Gold, why aren't you smiling?

287
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,174
Here we go. One, two.

288
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,345
Duk-mi, smile. You both look great.

289
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,526
Goodness.

290
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,155
We could've just taken a cab,
but thank you.

291
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,659
I had a great lunch thanks to you,
so it's the least I can do.

292
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,036
I guess you must like my food then.

293
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:24,332
Yes, I even ate
all the side dishes you gave me.

294
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,750
Really?

295
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,919
You should've told me sooner.

296
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,547
-Why don't I go inside and--
-Mom.

297
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,805
Director Gold has a lot of work to do,

298
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,683
but he was kept from doing any
since you just showed up.

299
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,145
This is the last time
you'll cause him any inconvenience.

300
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,859
I guess I should've known better.

301
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,153
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

302
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,364
-Maybe I'll treat you to a meal next time.
-Director Gold.

303
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,658
That's not necessary.

304
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,457
Thank you for today.

305
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,167
Drive home safely then.

306
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,460
Get going.

307
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,678
Bye.

308
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,014
Bye.

309
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,994
I'm sorry.

310
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,122
I won't cause you any inconvenience
like this from now on.

311
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,624
It was an enjoyable lunch.

312
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,501
I don't think of it as an inconvenience.

313
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,837
Thank you for understanding.

314
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,970
Actually,

315
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,140
my mouth is still burning.

316
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,768
-Because of...
-The Cheongyang chili gimbap?

317
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,105
My tongue feels numb right now.

318
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,280
It has been a long time

319
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,282
since I saw your smile.

320
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,665
Do I

321
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,959
make you uncomfortable?

322
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,669
No, not at all.

323
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,557
Since our fake relationship is over--

324
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,392
Just because it's over,

325
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,436
if things get awkward
between us like this,

326
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
what will happen from now on?

327
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,941
Well...

328
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,866
CHOI DA-IN

329
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,120
Ryan isn't answering his phone.

330
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,621
Is he with you?

331
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,749
No, it's a business matter.

332
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,420
Cha Si-an's schedule for his album
and the exhibition seem too tight.

333
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,505
Can you schedule a meeting?

334
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,716
Yes, thank you.

335
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,009
Okay.

336
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,106
Mom, your no-good friend is here.

337
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,317
Yeong-suk, your no-good son is here too.

338
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,360
I made gimbap. Come have some.

339
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,323
Wow, it's my favorite, gimbap.

340
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,118
Yeong-suk, I brought
your son-in-law with me.

341
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,286
Son-in-law?

342
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,040
Director Ryan Gold.

343
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,209
He's just her boss.

344
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,504
He's handsome, competent, and single.
Why is he just a boss?

345
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,923
He's a potential son-in-law.
Don't you agree?

346
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,550
I was hoping for that too,

347
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,219
but I guess I was wrong.

348
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,512
Duk-mi doesn't like him?

349
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,473
I made some lunch boxes
and went to the museum today

350
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,266
-to see Director Gold and all.
-Okay.

351
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,601
-But--
-Did you

352
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,313
make this gimbap for that jerk Lion?

353
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,358
I don't want this!

354
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,819
Don't eat it then!

355
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,240
-Mom.
-How could you and Duk-mi

356
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,784
act in the exact same and annoying way?

357
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,746
Who could I blame?
I'm the one who raised you like that.

358
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,459
What's wrong, Yeong-suk?

359
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,586
What did Duk-mi say?

360
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,756
I don't understand
what that brat's problem was.

361
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,341
She was pouting all day.

362
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,719
She didn't even look
at her favorite Cheongyang chili gimbap.

363
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,347
She was at work, and she might've been
worried about other employees.

364
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,099
I guess Duk-mi was embarrassed.

365
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,475
No. That's not it.

366
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,186
Director Gold gave us a ride home,

367
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,230
so I felt so grateful

368
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:01,025
and asked him to come inside
so I could give him some side dishes.

369
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,945
Duk-mi gave me an attitude again
and told me to go in.

370
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,822
What was wrong with Duk-mi?

371
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,202
It's because of me.

372
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,705
We're not a wealthy family,

373
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,874
and she's worried
about taking care of us when we get old.

374
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,668
If it weren't for that,
she'd be already married.

375
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,463
She doesn't have siblings either.

376
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,593
Why doesn't she? She has Eun-gi.

377
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,094
Even if Eun-gi gets married,

378
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,555
I'm going to tell him to consider you guys
as his parents-in-law.

379
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,515
Don't be ridiculous.

380
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,350
Don't you want to see Eun-gi get married?

381
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,478
What girl will marry him
if he has three parents?

382
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,483
That's why he should become
a more charming guy,

383
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,402
or make a ton of money.

384
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,260
-Excuse me.
-Oh, gosh!

385
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,972
Director Eom?

386
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,978
Help me up.

387
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,569
Director Eom, what brings you here?

388
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,570
What is this ridiculous...

389
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,405
I mean, why do you look like this?

390
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,328
What did she say?

391
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,163
Oh, follow her?

392
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,558
So my daughter Hyo-jin

393
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,103
is in charge of some critical business?

394
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,688
I can't say it's critical.

395
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,692
That is what influences a company to grow.

396
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,570
True talent.

397
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,824
The management
needs a keen eye to dispatch

398
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,493
talented employees to a suitable position.

399
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,705
But my Hyo-jin is being used
as a petty intern.

400
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,628
Ryan Gold.

401
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,675
Let's go for now.

402
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,223
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes.

403
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,726
When will the director
of TK Cultural Foundation be elected?

404
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,977
This week.

405
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,271
Tell them to postpone it for a week.
We have a new candidate.

406
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,397
A candidate?

407
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,151
Me, Eom So-hye.

408
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,945
To the fearless lion in the zoo,

409
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,449
I have to show who the real owner
of Cheum Museum is.

410
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,451
-Open the door.
-Yes, ma'am.

411
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,407
What is this?

412
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,623
Eun-gi, what is all this?

413
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,541
Go get changed.

414
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,719
Why did you do something so nice
when I didn't even ask?

415
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,097
I heard Mom and Dad
went to the museum today.

416
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,974
How did you know? Did Mom say something?

417
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,017
No.

418
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,979
She didn't say anything specific,
but she looked a little down.

419
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,318
She suddenly showed up
without even calling me.

420
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,864
I even had lunch, and she made me
eat gimbap when I was so full.

421
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,449
And Lion...

422
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,370
He's a very busy man,
and he couldn't work because of Mom.

423
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,038
He even gave her a ride home.

424
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,210
He was stressed out
because of our fake relationship too.

425
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,547
Did Lion say that he was stressed

426
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,924
about pretending to date you?

427
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,510
Yes.

428
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,472
So we decided to put an end
to our fake relationship,

429
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,642
-but Mom--
-She went to the museum

430
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,687
without calling and made Lion eat gimbap?

431
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,735
When you were upset
that your fake relationship was over?

432
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:05,872
I must be crazy. Why am I so immersed
in this fake relationship?

433
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,252
This is bad. I need a beating.

434
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,149
It's so hot.

435
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,943
What should I do?

436
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,051
What's she doing?

437
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,014
Duk-mi.

438
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,101
Are you crying?

439
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,443
This is why guys dump you.
Because you're so sloppy.

440
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,530
I'll go beat him up tomorrow, okay?

441
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,949
Do that for me.

442
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,326
Twist his legs
and do the scissors takedown.

443
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,245
That move has been banned in Judo.

444
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,413
-Do it.
-He'll really die.

445
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,790
Kill him!

446
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,708
Are you going to let the jerk
who dumped me live?

447
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,627
That jerk deserves to die.

448
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,212
Just kill him.

449
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,923
Okay, I'll really kill him.

450
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,008
You promised.

451
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,794
Duk-mi, don't change your profile picture
or your status

452
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,129
for the time being.

453
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,965
And don't even log on
to your social media either.

454
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,220
Yes, let's not embarrass myself.

455
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,181
Let's put this away.

456
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,939
I can't sleep. What should I do?

457
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,125
Let's see.

458
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,419
Okay.

459
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,504
CREATE A PUBLIC CHAT ROOM

460
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,756
CHAT ROOM DESCRIPTION

461
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,303
I welcome anyone who can't go to sleep
and wishes to talk

462
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,596
about their feelings.

463
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,144
SI-AN, MY HONEY HAS ENTERED THE CHATROOM

464
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,562
Hello.

465
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,982
I came in because I broke up.

466
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,695
Hello, Si-an, My Honey.
Let me lend you my ears.

467
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,198
I USED TO DATE THIS GUY

468
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,743
WE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING MARRIED

469
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,038
BUT HE CHEATED ON ME

470
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,539
HE'S BEEN EVEN LYING TO ME ABOUT HIS AGE

471
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,999
What a jerk.

472
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,669
So are you saying
the guy you were planning to marry

473
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,506
lied to you about his age
and even cheated on you?

474
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,634
First, you should sue him for making
false promises regarding marriage.

475
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,718
But...

476
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,262
You're 12?

477
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:55,559
SI-AN, MY HONEY
THE ROAD TO SI-AN: YOU'RE 12?

478
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:03,025
Si-an, My Honey,
you've only lived for 12 years.

479
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,445
You have so many more opportunities
to meet a better guy.

480
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,573
Did you meet a lot of good guys?

481
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,868
Next.

482
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,204
SI-AN'S PRINCESS

483
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,164
My boyfriend and I go
to the same math academy.

484
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,921
And his female friend
also goes there as well.

485
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,673
But the thing is, I was late yesterday,

486
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,134
and that brat sat next to my boyfriend.

487
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,552
My gosh.

488
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,264
So I got angry and asked her
to switch seats, but she refused.

489
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,099
Well, that's upsetting.

490
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,393
So what happened?

491
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,811
So I grabbed her hair...

492
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,272
SI-AN'S PRINCESS

493
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,816
My mom wants me to turn off the computer.

494
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,526
SI-AN'S PRINCESS LEFT THE CHAT ROOM

495
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,837
Should I just go to sleep?

496
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,135
Knock, knock.

497
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,720
LATTE
DO I JUST NEED TO TELL YOU MY STORY?

498
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,640
LATTE

499
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,058
Did you go to bed?

500
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,519
No, I didn't.

501
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,607
Hello, Latte. Let me lend you my ears.

502
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,525
HELLO, LATTE
LET ME LEND YOU MY EARS

503
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,114
Do I just need to tell you my story?

504
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,452
Yes, I'm here for people
who can't sleep at night

505
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,162
because they're hurting.

506
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,668
LATTE

507
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,087
The thing is, at the...

508
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,422
Gosh.

509
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,426
Work. Just work.

510
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,303
At work...

511
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,639
Yes?

512
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,560
There's this person
I've come to like at work.

513
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,732
It must be a one-sided love.

514
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,281
It's not

515
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,909
a one-sided love.

516
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,369
I'm sure of it.

517
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,084
Every time she looks at me,
she gives me a bright smile.

518
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,047
She forgives my mistakes.

519
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,216
I'd like to apologize once again.

520
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,635
I'm sincerely very sorry.

521
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,012
Okay.

522
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,849
And even her parents like me.

523
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,936
I packed a few side dishes
that you seemed to like earlier.

524
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,145
Thank you for this.

525
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,565
Director Gold, I hope you visit again.

526
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:52,027
So I was going to tell her how I feel
to take things to another step.

527
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,281
We should end our fake relationship now.

528
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,451
But she suddenly wanted
to end things between us.

529
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,745
Gosh.

530
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,540
But end what?

531
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,923
LATTE

532
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,051
She wanted to stop being friends.

533
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,848
You were going to tell the person
how you feel

534
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,224
but ended up becoming distant?

535
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,186
By any chance,

536
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,773
do you think maybe that person
felt a little pressured

537
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,693
by your feelings?

538
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,740
It'd be nice if the person we like
also liked us back.

539
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,368
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU ARE SINCERE

540
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,828
But if that's not the case,

541
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,373
it might be right to give up
on asking that person out

542
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,835
so that your feelings won't end up

543
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,837
pressuring that person.

544
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,809
Latte, Si-an won't feel pressured
regardless of how much you like him.

545
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,855
You just recently became his fan,
so you still have a lot to see.

546
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,565
I hope Si-an cheers you up.

547
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,035
What if Si-an doesn't make me feel
any better?

548
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,998
If Si-an can't make you smile, that means

549
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,085
you're actually really sick.

550
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,586
You should see a doctor.

551
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,839
See you again, Latte.

552
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,470
THE ROAD TO SI-AN LEFT THE CHAT ROOM

553
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,109
Look who's all talk.

554
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,619
Pressure?

555
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,039
Yes.

556
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,253
I did the right thing
not to tell him how I feel.

557
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:01,049
DELETE

558
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,891
DELETE

559
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,404
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT?

560
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,788
I don't think I can delete it.

561
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,972
-Ju-hyeok.
-Yes?

562
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,434
I'm stepping out, but I'll be back
before your band rehearsal.

563
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,810
You can take your time.

564
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,687
I don't mind skipping a session.

565
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,858
Skip a day, and yourself will know it.

566
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,985
Skip two days, and critics will know.

567
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,321
Skip three days,
and the audience will know.

568
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,074
I'm glad since no one listens to my music.

569
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,368
Excuse me.

570
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,538
-How can I help you?
-The song that's playing now--

571
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,249
Isn't it great? It's by a band named Fade.

572
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,919
He is the band's vocalist

573
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,796
and guitarist.

574
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,631
He wrote the song as well.

575
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,466
It's great and all,

576
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,052
but I've been here for an hour

577
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,721
and this has been on repeat
the whole time.

578
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,059
Well, he's only recorded this one song.

579
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,686
I'll turn on another song for you.

580
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,610
Haven't you written other songs?

581
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,279
-I have.
-Then let's record them.

582
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,739
-But it costs a lot and...
-Hey.

583
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,116
Ms. Lee?

584
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,993
What's the favor you need?

585
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,329
Do you remember the cheer sticks
we ordered for the event?

586
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,498
Can you check on the sample for me?

587
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,294
I don't know what he's thinking,
but Seung-min asked me out on a date.

588
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,546
Seung-min asked you out?

589
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,465
I thought he was super busy
with his final show.

590
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,592
It's weird, right?

591
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,177
Something's off.

592
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,140
What's so odd about a husband
asking his wife out on a date?

593
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,101
I'll check on the sample,
so don't worry and go.

594
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,978
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

595
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,147
-What do you do when depressed?
-Fangirling.

596
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,316
Today, I'm heading out to take photos.

597
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,696
I can't believe I'm fangirling
even in this state.

598
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,115
It's all the more reason
for you to focus on it.

599
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,242
Fangirling is the way to go.

600
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,994
Fangirling is the way to go.

601
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,123
I'll get going then.
You be happy for us both.

602
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,337
Yes, the draft looks great.

603
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,380
When can I see a sample?

604
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,508
Sure, I'll swing by tomorrow.

605
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,886
All right, thank you.

606
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,188
Grab them.

607
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,809
I knew it. A date, my foot.

608
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,356
-Seung-min.
-Oh, you're here.

609
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,900
You should've told me
if you were craving barbecue.

610
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,861
Go and hang your coat.

611
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,082
Couldn't he take my coat
and hang it up for me?

612
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,467
What's this?

613
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,983
Seung-min.

614
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,985
Yes, Seon-ju.

615
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,029
Did you cheat on me?

616
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,573
You!

617
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,117
What's this? Why did you buy this?

618
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,204
I said I'm sorry.

619
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,501
You bought me this out of the blue,

620
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,878
so of course, I was startled.

621
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,213
One might think
that I've never bought you anything.

622
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,425
Well, you're my greatest gift of all.

623
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,805
Seon-ju, don't you ever forget that.

624
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,224
-Of course, not.
-Whatever I do,

625
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,144
I do it for you and Geon-u.
You know that, right?

626
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,896
Of course.

627
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,063
Good.

628
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,573
This reminds me of how we met.

629
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,743
I ran into you at a broadcasting station

630
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,119
while I was fangirling with Duk-mi.

631
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,609
Seung-min,

632
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,402
fangirling is

633
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,488
what brought us together,

634
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,407
so you should be grateful

635
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,535
that I've been a fangirl.

636
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,744
Got it?

637
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,754
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN
IN THE UNIVERSE, CHA SI-AN

638
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,607
Here we go.

639
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,362
CHA SI-AN FANPAGE
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

640
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,254
Fangirling is the best.
Nothing is more exciting.

641
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,744
Ryan.

642
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,459
Hello, Mr. Cha Si-an.

643
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,969
What's with the drinks?

644
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,680
-Do you need a drinking buddy?
-No.

645
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,807
I only have enough for me.

646
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,519
So you'll drink alone?

647
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,691
I guess you had a TV show today.

648
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,651
Yes.

649
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,613
The Road to Si-an uploaded
a whole bunch of photos today.

650
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,989
That's a first.

651
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,742
The Road to Si-an?

652
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,995
Yes, I told you about her before.

653
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,332
Even I'm amazed

654
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,417
by the photos she takes of me.

655
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,378
Who knew I had this expression?

656
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,382
-This photo--
-Stop.

657
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,258
Sorry?

658
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,392
Well, this is your floor.

659
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,936
Right. I'll see you tomorrow then.

660
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,605
Tomorrow?

661
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,607
I'm meeting with Ms. Choi Da-in.

662
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,529
Ms. Sung will also...

663
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,883
Ms. Sung.

664
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,688
What time is the meeting
with Mr. Cha and Ms. Choi?

665
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,815
It's at 2 p.m.

666
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,819
-Then at 1 p.m. in the parking lot--
-Actually,

667
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,988
I have a meeting outside
prior to that one.

668
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,407
I'll head to her studio from there.

669
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,535
Am I that burdening...

670
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,082
Okay, fine.

671
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,474
See if it came out right.

672
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,604
How about we change this part?

673
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,732
-Will you meet the deadline?
-Of course.

674
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,485
Thank you then.
I'll take the sample with me.

675
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,699
One can play hooky at times, right?

676
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,087
I'm here, Ms. Choi.

677
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,839
You're here early. What about Ms. Sung?

678
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,758
Didn't you come together?

679
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,177
No, she had another meeting.

680
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,763
I'm glad I came to Korea.

681
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,516
It's nice to see you often.

682
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,319
Gosh, I seriously don't want to go.

683
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,866
No, I still have Si-an.

684
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,701
I'm here to see Si-an.

685
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,370
Fangirling meets work.

686
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,587
Can I get an autograph?

687
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,258
-An autograph?
-Yes, I'm really your fan.

688
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,718
I even prepared a paper and pen.

689
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,554
Sign this first.

690
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,932
We have to sign a contract first
in order to work.

691
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,725
Ryan, let me get her autograph first.

692
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,316
-Your name?
-It's Cha Si-an.

693
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,820
TO CHA SI-AN

694
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,531
Do you still use that autograph?

695
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,700
I told you to change it
so people can actually read it.

696
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,118
It's okay as long as you can read it.

697
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,913
So did you think up of a concept?

698
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,749
Cha Si-an of White Ocean.

699
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,752
Since this is a new start,

700
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,590
I'm thinking of showing various shades
based on white.

701
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,926
White, white smoke, and snow.

702
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,846
When we think of it as just one color,

703
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,224
it actually includes thousands
of various colors inside it?

704
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,309
Right.

705
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,979
So I'll add a spectrum effect
in this background.

706
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,398
Like the media facade technique?

707
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,484
Just like last year's Berlin Art Fair?

708
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,902
Exactly.

709
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,071
I knew it. This is what I love
about having meetings with you.

710
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,073
Is this piece from two years ago?

711
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,701
I really liked this and wanted to keep it.

712
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,994
-Really?
-Yes.

713
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,998
-This has similar details.
-This one looks good too.

714
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,626
What about this one?

715
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,629
I understand your intent,

716
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,547
but why don't you make it simpler?

717
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,884
-I thought you liked it.
-Think of a concept that can appeal

718
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,720
to the public more intuitively and easily.

719
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,804
You're a professional.

720
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,182
-You never say okay easily.
-My gosh!

721
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,686
Ms. Sung.

722
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,815
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

723
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,401
I'm okay. I'll clean this up. I'm sorry.

724
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,778
No, it's fine.

725
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,211
What is wrong with me? Gosh.

726
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,173
Ms. Sung.

727
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,842
I'm sorry, I startled you.

728
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,804
No, we're really fine,
as long as you weren't hurt.

729
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,349
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

730
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,729
Hello?

731
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,064
Yes.

732
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,900
Now?

733
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,779
I'm in the middle of something. Really?

734
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,364
I understand.

735
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:37,824
Okay.

736
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,203
-What should I do?
-What's wrong?

737
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,539
I ordered some wood at the workshop,

738
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,833
but the craftsman isn't there right now.

739
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,253
I'll go then.

740
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,214
-Will you do that?
-Sure.

741
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,592
-I can go now, right?
-Thanks, I owe you one.

742
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,676
Okay.

743
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,932
Hello? Yes, I've sent someone right now.

744
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,393
Yes. Okay.

745
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,907
Hello?

746
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,248
Is anyone here?

747
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,962
Is he not here yet?

748
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,504
-Mom!
-Just take the photo already.

749
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,216
It has been a long time

750
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,843
since I saw your smile.

751
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:54,312
By any chance, do you think maybe
that person felt a little pressured

752
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,481
by your feelings?

753
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,238
THE ROAD TO SI-AN FANPAGE

754
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,364
MESSAGE FROM LATTE

755
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,532
Are my feelings

756
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,367
for her

757
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,621
really just pressure?

758
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:14,791
Latte,

759
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,710
actually, I lied to you.

760
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,254
Ms. Sung.

761
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:25,092
I didn't give up on telling him
how I feel for that person's sake.

762
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:29,555
It was because I was a coward
and didn't want to get hurt.

763
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,724
Perhaps, Latte,

764
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,103
that person might not have felt pressured
by how you felt.

765
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,231
That person

766
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:42,151
might have been afraid of being hurt
and ran away just like me.

767
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,822
So why don't we summon up our courage

768
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,907
one more time?

769
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:50,785
SEND

770
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,162
YOUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN SENT TO LATTE

771
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,138
Ms. Sung.

772
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:56,976
Director Gold.

773
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,443
I didn't want to ask you.

774
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,696
I really didn't want to ask you this.

775
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,495
What was so hard for you?

776
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,082
About being in a fake relationship
with me.

777
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,009
Did you hate it that much?

778
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,059
Yes.

779
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,772
What did you hate so much about it?

780
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,232
I didn't call you every day

781
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,026
or ask you to meet me.

782
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,403
All you had to do

783
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,114
was pretend for a short moment.

784
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,784
Was it that hard

785
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,535
and stressful for you?

786
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,210
I was so excited and happy.

787
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,255
-What was so--
-Because it was fake.

788
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,067
I hated it because it was fake.

789
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,907
I wanted to date you for real.

790
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,131
We're in a relationship now, right?

791
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,382
I'm dating Lion.

792
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,759
I'm the only guy

793
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:20,054
who knows Duk-mi better than herself.

794
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,015
You must've believed my words
more than Ryan's feelings for you.

795
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,185
It's seven o'clock. It's the perfect time
to go see my girlfriend.

796
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,770
Was I the only one who missed you?

797
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,606
Duk-mi. Who would you choose
between me and Lion?

798
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,024
I like you, Duk-mi.

799
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:35,236
You know I don't like letting go
of someone's hand.

800
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,238
Why don't you just take me inside as well?

801
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,825
