1
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,286
-How old are you?
-Seven.

2
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,289
I'm seven too, and so is he.

3
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,917
My name is Sung Duk-mi,

4
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,836
and his name is Nam Eun-gi.

5
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,629
What is your name?

6
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,173
My name is

7
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,967
Heo Yun-jae.

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,469
Are you waiting for your mom?

9
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,597
Do you want to play with us?

10
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,615
Did you sleep well?

11
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,535
What about you?

12
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,663
Are you still sleepy?

13
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,957
It's still bedtime.

14
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,792
It's your birthday today.

15
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,591
Happy birthday.

16
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,009
Thank you.

17
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,304
You're not even opening your eyes.

18
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,474
Don't you want to see me?

19
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,859
Wow, I get to see your face
as soon as I wake up.

20
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,778
This is an amazing birthday.

21
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,116
You need to get up now.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,705
It's my birthday.

23
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,206
I don't need to get up.

24
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,877
Okay, then. Sleep a bit more.

25
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,838
Should we just stay like this
instead of going to work?

26
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,631
How about we both quit

27
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,341
and become jobless?

28
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,346
-I'll get up.
-I'm serious.

29
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,642
Let's stay in bed like this all day
and not go to work.

30
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,229
-Can't we do that?
-No, we can't.

31
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,355
Why not?

32
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,068
You're too precious.

33
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,404
You're too precious to look at all day.

34
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,408
Duk-mi.

35
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,662
Duk-mi, you are darn--

36
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,706
Darn pretty even in the morning.

37
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,087
You're dirty.

38
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,387
How can you say I'm dirty?

39
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,983
Don't be scared.

40
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,069
Will I be able to go to work?

41
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,946
-Here we go.
-Oh, no.

42
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,073
-Why are you shaking?
-I'm not shaking.

43
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,324
Do you not trust me?

44
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,452
What's all this?

45
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,205
It's your birthday,
so you should eat seaweed soup.

46
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,915
Are you going to cook it yourself?

47
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,916
Yes.

48
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,004
But what are these Cheongyang chili
and ginseng for?

49
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,423
You love Cheongyang chili,

50
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,592
and ginseng is good for your body.

51
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,763
But I don't think you're supposed
to add them in seaweed soup.

52
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,350
Really? Then I'll use them
to make gimbap later.

53
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,768
Okay.

54
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,772
I can't wait to eat ginseng gimbap.

55
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,822
Is this enough?

56
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,034
Director Gold,
this whole thing is for 60 servings.

57
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,870
So this much will be enough
to feed 20 people.

58
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,126
Then should I take out this much?

59
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,254
I'll cook a delicious meal for you.
Just wait a little bit.

60
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,464
Okay, I'm counting on you.

61
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,221
-This one?
-Yes, it looks nice.

62
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,515
You also need to get changed.

63
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,808
I'm just going to wear this.

64
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,270
Don't you think our colleagues know
a bit too much about us?

65
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,522
Are you embarrassed, Mr. Shy Boy?

66
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,983
Then just wear my clothes to work.
I'll pick out an outfit for you.

67
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,655
Gosh, fine. I'll just go home
and get changed.

68
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,658
I think this will look nice on you.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,868
What?

70
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,249
What are you doing?

71
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,253
Let me apply it for you.

72
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,838
Have you done it before?

73
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,465
I'm Ryan Gold.

74
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,770
You look pretty.

75
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,024
Now, it's my turn to put lipstick on you.

76
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,330
I think you need a bit more.

77
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,099
Is this how you want me to go to work?

78
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,768
It's pretty.

79
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,853
You look a lot more lively.

80
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,945
Can I be a movie star
since it's my birthday today?

81
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,495
Don't I look like a celebrity?

82
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,708
You already fell for me

83
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,799
I caught your eyes

84
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,259
I make your heart ache

85
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,390
I sweep everyone off their feet

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,271
A runway spreads out
A highway opens for me

87
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,821
You'll never be able to forget my name

88
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,703
Seung-min, drink this.

89
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,830
Thank you, Seon-ju.

90
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,916
Are you working?
Is it a variety show proposal?

91
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,126
No.

92
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,172
Remember how I said I'm only going
to focus on making you laugh?

93
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,132
So I thought about
what we should do together

94
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,259
and wrote a proposal on that.

95
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,802
You even wrote a proposal?

96
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,138
Listen. This is the title.

97
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,973
Will It Work on a Campsite?

98
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,683
-Camping?
-Yes.

99
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,937
It's about us going camping
every weekend with Geon-u.

100
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,982
We can cook outside and look
at the stars in the night sky.

101
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,442
We'll be able to relax and recharge.

102
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,653
But do we even have a tent?

103
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,156
We need to buy one. There are a lot
of camping tools we need to buy.

104
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,533
Portable pots and pans,
a burner, a lantern, and...

105
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,161
Seung-min, as you already know,

106
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,954
I'm very sensitive about where I sleep.

107
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,915
Oh, I forgot about that. Then...

108
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,877
Then should we just buy a camping car?

109
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,925
-Is there anything else?
-Of course.

110
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,260
Here's the title of my second proposal.

111
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,262
Fishing over Flowers.

112
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,056
-Fishing?
-Yes.

113
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,266
I heard night fishing is really great.

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,895
It's more about
spending time together than fishing.

115
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
We can have long conversations.
And once it gets dark,

116
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,191
-we can sleep in a tent while...
-The tent, again?

117
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,109
Oh, right. If you don't want
to sleep in a tent...

118
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,153
We should get a camping car after all.

119
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,115
-Seung-min.
-Yes?

120
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,118
Instead of trying to do things I'd like,

121
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,204
how about you focus more

122
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,206
on trying not to do things
that I don't like?

123
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,458
-Not doing things you don't like?
-Yes.

124
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,877
I understand.

125
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,964
Then, in order to learn
about the things you don't like,

126
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,715
we need to talk to each other a lot.

127
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,843
-So fishing is--
-That's enough. Stop it!

128
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,679
My gosh, okay.

129
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,305
I should go to work now.

130
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,599
Let's talk a lot in the evening

131
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,226
about the things you don't like

132
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,145
-while we fish.
-Hey, just get lost.

133
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,107
What's wrong with him?

134
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,776
If that dumfounded laugh
also counts as a laugh,

135
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,695
your husband succeeded.

136
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,075
Isn't Seung-min so cute?

137
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,537
This is the final design
of the exhibition space.

138
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,330
Did you run a simulation
of the exhibition route?

139
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,584
Yes, Mr. Cha's exhibition room is expected
to be the most crowded,

140
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,211
so we assigned him
to the most spacious area.

141
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,672
The temporary walls
will start getting built next week,

142
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,592
and they're going to get painted
as soon as they get installed.

143
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,385
How about we use a stronger color

144
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,721
for the main wall at the entrance
of the exhibition hall?

145
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,180
Got it.

146
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,684
Did you hire all the staff?

147
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,854
We finished hiring the docent
and the guards.

148
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,106
And they'll be receiving training
starting from next week.

149
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,234
Okay, then I guess everything's--

150
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,904
Director Gold, you need to prepare
an opening speech.

151
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,906
Okay.

152
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,661
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

153
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,914
I know we're busy, but

154
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,958
it's our first time
celebrating your birthday together.

155
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,501
You'll make time for me tonight, right?

156
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,295
I guess I can do that for you.

157
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,381
Our goal today is to get off work on time.

158
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,482
Your mom told you to wait
in the playground?

159
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,277
She told me that she'll be back soon.

160
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,323
What's your name?

161
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,741
Yun-jae.

162
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,910
Heo Yun-jae.

163
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,746
You must be hungry, Yun-jae.

164
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,123
Would you like to come
to my house and have some food?

165
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,004
Why not? Duk-mi and Eun-gi
are also going to eat together.

166
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,049
I need to wait for my mom

167
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,550
in the playground.

168
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,223
Then I'll wait there instead.

169
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,559
I'll let you know when your mom comes.
What do you say?

170
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,356
Now, go on upstairs and eat.

171
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,816
Wash your hands first.

172
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,150
-Okay!
-Okay!

173
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,996
Why do you keep looking at this?

174
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,542
Why do you think Eun-gi asked us

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,293
that boy's name yesterday?

176
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,255
He said he just asked for no reason.

177
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,173
Eun-gi has

178
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,971
never once talked about that day
even by mistake.

179
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,267
I've always felt bad but grateful for it.

180
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,273
I think something's up.

181
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,442
Something he can't tell me about.

182
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,320
If it's something he can't say,

183
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,448
then he won't say it.

184
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,783
If it's something that he should,
then he'll tell us.

185
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,535
Be patient with him.

186
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,921
Would you like to head in first?

187
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,840
Why? We can go in together.

188
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,259
I'm worried that we're slightly late.

189
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,094
Sure thing.

190
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,649
Hello, did you make a reservation?

191
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,359
Yes, it's under Ryan Gold.

192
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,450
Happy birthday to you

193
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,369
Happy birthday to you

194
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,580
Happy birthday, Ms. Sung.

195
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,837
Mr. Cha.

196
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,260
You should make a wish.

197
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,058
There's nothing to wish for anymore.

198
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,062
My brother's great and all,

199
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,648
but I can't believe he's late
to the party he prepared himself.

200
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,982
I hope you forgive him.

201
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,652
Director Gold is running late?

202
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,322
Yes, that's why he told me
to wish you a happy birthday first.

203
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,616
That's why I came running.

204
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,372
I'm fine with us meeting
Director Gold and Ms. Sung,

205
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,958
but won't we be ruining their date?

206
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,669
Are you seriously still calling him that?

207
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,795
He's Yun-jae.

208
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,046
Heo Yun-jae.

209
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,466
Also, what's so bad
about crashing their date? We can do that.

210
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,260
Okay.

211
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,015
Here's your mission.

212
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,810
You, and only you,

213
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,938
will go into the next room
and wish Duk-mi a happy birthday.

214
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,273
I'm running a bit late, you see.

215
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,608
Who is that?

216
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,402
It's Ryan.

217
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,154
Mom, wait here for a second.

218
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,784
-Is that so?
-Yes.

219
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,870
I didn't even know
that it was your birthday.

220
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,080
If I had known, I would've bought a gift.

221
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,915
My Si-an,

222
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,042
you are my gift.

223
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,629
Just a second.

224
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,969
How do you like my gift to you?

225
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,890
-Is that Ryan?
-Yes.

226
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm the most ecstatic fangirl
in this entire world now.

227
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,187
Thank you.

228
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,194
You have 20 minutes.

229
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,157
Just make sure you don't enjoy his company
more than you enjoy mine.

230
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,998
We're ruining Ms. Sung's birthday.
You should've spent it with her alone.

231
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,041
It's all right.

232
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,959
I'm sure she'll love it too.

233
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,422
In 20 minutes,
we'll go and join the party.

234
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,590
In 20 minutes?

235
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,886
I like it,

236
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,932
being alone with my mother.

237
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,226
Thank you

238
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,395
for calling me your mother.

239
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,774
Actually,

240
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,068
it's still a bit awkward.

241
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,197
I promise to say it more comfortably
over time.

242
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,200
I know it's awkward for you too,

243
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,495
but please call me casually.

244
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,916
Yun-jae.

245
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,543
Yes, Mother.

246
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,802
It's Ms. Sung's birthday,
but I'm receiving the gift.

247
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,306
It's September 12.

248
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,643
Yun-jae, your birthday is

249
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,187
September 12.

250
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,941
September 12.

251
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,780
We should celebrate it together this year.

252
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,285
That reminds me. I brought photos.

253
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,538
There aren't many though.

254
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,382
I've lived my life remembering you
at this age.

255
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,302
"How tall would he be at ten?

256
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,764
What would he be like at 20?"

257
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,975
You have no idea

258
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,686
how much I missed you.

259
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,199
I'll show you

260
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,328
how I looked at ten, and twenty too.

261
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,958
I have many photos.

262
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,251
Good.

263
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,256
My gosh.

264
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,805
Do you see that?

265
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,980
Director Gold.

266
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,607
-Hello.
-Hey.

267
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,484
Happy birthday, Ms. Sung.

268
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,693
Thank you.

269
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,112
-I see that you're thrilled.
-Am I?

270
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,115
It's probably because you're here.

271
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,094
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

272
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,388
-Ms. Sung Duk-mi?
-Yes?

273
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,015
Your boyfriend is driving you home,

274
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,893
but you're looking at photos of Si-an.
How could you do that?

275
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,522
That's not true.
This is what I was looking at.

276
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,108
I was admiring my good-looking boyfriend.

277
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,197
To be honest,

278
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,741
I prepared a birthday gift.

279
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,326
Other than the meet-and-greet with Si-an?

280
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,162
It hasn't been delivered yet.

281
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,708
Could you wait a few more days?

282
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,877
Today was more than enough,

283
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,256
but I'll wait
since you prepared it for me.

284
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,385
I have something to show you.

285
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,724
This is me when I was little.

286
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,143
My mother gave them to me earlier.

287
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,062
You were adorable!

288
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,607
You've been cute, pretty,
and handsome your whole life.

289
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,778
Would you like to keep them in your room?

290
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,572
Really?

291
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,784
Then I'll scan these
and give them back to you.

292
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,787
I can't keep
what's clearly precious to you.

293
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,832
Can I see your old photos too?

294
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,792
You can have the entire album.

295
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,754
I had

296
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,048
the best day today.

297
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,717
I enjoyed it too.

298
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,308
CHOIKANG JUDO

299
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,935
Who's Yun-jae?

300
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,645
It's Director Gold's Korean name.

301
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,731
-Director Ryan Gold?
-Yes.

302
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,483
He must've figured out
what he was called before his adoption.

303
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,405
What's your name?

304
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,907
Yun-jae.

305
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,451
Heo Yun-jae.

306
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,870
Heo Yun-jae.

307
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,876
He was so adorable.

308
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,510
Hi, Eun-gi. What's up?

309
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,054
I have something to ask you.

310
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,348
Could we talk in person?

311
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,183
Sure thing.

312
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,357
-I have a gift for you.
-Are these chicken feet?

313
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,108
You sure know what I like.

314
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,944
So what's this about?

315
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,529
It's about Director Gold.

316
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,532
I know what you're worried about,

317
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,410
but I already told him about you.
No worries.

318
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,497
That's not it.
I came across his Korean name and...

319
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,754
These are pictures of him
when he was little. Wasn't he adorable?

320
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,634
Heo Yun-jae.

321
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,178
How do you know that name?

322
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,847
Seon-ju told you, didn't she?

323
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,478
I should go.

324
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,730
Just like that?
You said you had questions.

325
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,648
Oh, right.

326
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,942
I forgot what they were though.

327
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,735
You know how I am.

328
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,195
I'll get going then. Enjoy.

329
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,822
Am I supposed to eat these alone?

330
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,366
-Well, thanks.
-Sure.

331
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,268
What do I do?

332
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,015
Let go! I'm not your mom.

333
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,561
Mrs. Ko.

334
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,355
Mrs. Ko!

335
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,782
Mrs. Ko.

336
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,077
We're going to see Duk-mi
and Duk-su, right?

337
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,745
Right?

338
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,289
We're on our way to the hospital, right?

339
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,416
So Duk-mi and Duk-su

340
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,085
won't be sick anymore.

341
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,463
OFFICE

342
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,772
Mrs. Ko.

343
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,774
Mrs. Ko.

344
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,983
Let go!

345
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,611
-I'm not your mom.
-Mrs. Ko.

346
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,988
Mrs. Ko!

347
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,951
Mrs. Ko!

348
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,830
Mrs. Ko!

349
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,835
Mrs. Ko!

350
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,795
Mrs. Ko!

351
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,762
Mrs. Ko!

352
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,322
Wait.

353
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,575
Let me catch my breath.

354
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,827
Eun-gi,

355
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,912
do you think this is a good idea?

356
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,792
Mom.

357
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,878
I'll do the talking.

358
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,671
You just

359
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,923
stay by Mom's side.

360
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,091
What about you?

361
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,177
Will you be okay?

362
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,141
Let's go.

363
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,692
Is it about this child?

364
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,614
When you asked what his name was,

365
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,492
I suspected something was wrong.

366
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,538
I heard he was coming with you,

367
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,373
so I prepared myself.

368
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,586
Eun-gi.

369
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,506
This is something I have to know, right?

370
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,434
Then tell me. I'm okay.

371
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,783
Mom.

372
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,162
This could be very shocking,

373
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,333
sad, or even painful.

374
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,712
But just remember this.

375
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,008
You are a good person.

376
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,302
What happened back then...

377
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,722
You had no choice.

378
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,445
Director Ryan Gold.

379
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,413
Director Ryan Gold...

380
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,792
is Yun-jae.

381
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,297
Heo Yun-jae.

382
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,479
That child,

383
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,900
Heo Yun-jae,

384
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,821
is Director Gold?

385
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,254
That child...

386
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,342
That child back then?

387
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,416
Bring me some coffee
if you want your picture back.

388
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,759
Director Gold, it's been a long time.

389
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,803
Do you have milk today?

390
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,097
What kind of coffee shop
doesn't have milk?

391
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,641
Geon-u, say hello.

392
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,686
Hello. My name is Kang Geon-u,
and I am seven years old.

393
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,564
Hello. I'm Ryan...

394
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,193
I'm Director Heo Yun-jae.

395
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,405
Are you a judo director too?

396
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,700
Isn't it time for Geon-u
to go to Eun-gi's judo studio?

397
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,743
Why is he still here?

398
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,578
He suddenly texted me

399
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,039
that today's class was canceled
due to personal reasons.

400
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,250
He didn't mention that yesterday.

401
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,087
I met him briefly last night.
He said he had something to ask.

402
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,424
May I take your order?

403
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,759
Ju-hyeok, we'll have a latte
with condensed milk, and...

404
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,973
Since you bought me coffee,
I'll give you back your picture.

405
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,015
Here.

406
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,644
I scanned and framed them in my room.

407
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,271
Come and take a look next time.

408
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,109
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

409
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,694
Do you remember

410
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,697
everything from your childhood?

411
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,535
A little. But not
when I was way too young.

412
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,204
By any chance,

413
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,249
do you remember my face when...

414
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,960
It's my mom.

415
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,880
She wants me to come straight home
after work.

416
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,632
Why is she suddenly asking me to come?
Is something wrong?

417
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,551
I guess

418
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,179
you'll have to be without me today.

419
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,097
You'll be so bored, right?

420
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,308
I won't be bored.

421
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,227
-Are you serious?
-Of course I'll be bored.

422
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,340
Mr. Nam.

423
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,140
I have something to ask you.

424
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,439
CHOIKANG JUDO

425
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,066
My memories from childhood

426
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,611
before I was adopted
are coming back to me.

427
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,074
In that memory, I can see Duk-mi, you,

428
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,993
and Duk-mi's mother.

429
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,587
Do you remember by any chance?

430
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,427
My name was Heo Yun-jae.

431
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,936
I remember.

432
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,110
It's been a very long time,

433
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,196
Yun-jae.

434
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,285
Mom.

435
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,496
What are you talking about?

436
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,915
How do you know Heo Yun-jae?

437
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,003
He was waiting for his mom

438
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,256
in the playground until it got very dark.

439
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,010
I was only going to feed him dinner
at our house,

440
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,721
thinking that his mom would soon come
and pick him up.

441
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,891
And when she didn't show up,
I thought she'd come the next day.

442
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,854
But almost a month passed by.

443
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,860
And that's when we suddenly became
financially unstable.

444
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,904
So?

445
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,118
So what happened?

446
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,163
We were struggling so much,

447
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,249
so I had no choice but to abandon...

448
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,910
No.

449
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,540
No way. Mom.

450
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,168
This isn't true, right?

451
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,880
Mom, it's not true, right?
Tell me it's not true.

452
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,881
Duk-mi.

453
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,263
I did it.

454
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,810
I committed an irreversible sin.

455
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,275
-Duk-mi.
-Goodness.

456
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,546
Duk-mi.

457
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,733
Duk-mi.

458
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,152
I want to be alone.

459
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,780
Hurray.

460
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,866
Come and catch me.

461
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,793
My name is Heo Yun-jae.

462
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,233
Mom, Duk-mi's drawing me again!

463
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,197
My goodness, you guys. Oh, gosh.

464
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,241
My goodness.

465
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,076
Hey!

466
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,504
Was it a scary dream?

467
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,882
It wasn't just a dream. It was scary
since it was from my memory.

468
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,760
It was the day I was abandoned
at the orphanage.

469
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,279
I hope

470
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,282
you don't hate my mom too much.

471
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,285
She felt tormented for a very long time

472
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,414
for not having taken care of you.

473
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,876
Looking back,

474
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,754
I'm actually grateful for what happened.

475
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,715
Thank you

476
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,634
for thinking that way.

477
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,435
But,

478
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,771
I think there was one more kid.

479
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,774
What happened to him?

480
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,697
It was Duk-su.

481
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,744
Duk-mi doesn't remember

482
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,914
anything.

483
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,554
Hey, Eun-gi.

484
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,849
Dad.

485
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,189
Are you here
because you're worried about Duk-mi?

486
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,985
Did you tell her everything?

487
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,113
No, but it's time to tell her.

488
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,573
Do you want me to be there with you?

489
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,533
I'll tell her everything.

490
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,328
You should go home

491
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
and console your mom.

492
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,501
Tell her it's okay.

493
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,671
Tell her everything will be okay.

494
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,882
Okay.

495
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,219
Eun-gi.

496
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,348
Thank you, my son.

497
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,864
Hey, Eun-gi.

498
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,953
You know the passcode
to Duk-mi's apartment, right?

499
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,916
Right?

500
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,688
Dad.

501
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,902
I wish it wasn't true.

502
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,823
But what Mom told me

503
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,659
was all true, wasn't it?

504
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,212
Duk-mi.

505
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,886
I know you're going through
a lot right now.

506
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,555
And

507
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,643
I might make it even worse for you.

508
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,771
Still,

509
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,441
there's something you must know.

510
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,532
Duk-su.

511
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,414
Your younger brother.

512
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,042
Sung Duk-su.

513
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,837
My younger brother?

514
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,688
Duk-mi.

515
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,985
Who's this, Dad?

516
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,031
Your younger brother.

517
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,786
When you were seven years old,

518
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,955
he was five.

519
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,707
You guys got into a car accident

520
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,668
on your way back home from kindergarten.

521
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,629
And you forgot about everything

522
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,924
because of the shock.
You were with him that day.

523
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,386
After that accident,

524
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,972
you suddenly couldn't remember

525
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,391
anything about Duk-su.

526
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,980
So it was impossible for your mom

527
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,649
to be in her right mind.

528
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,279
She couldn't afford to lose you too

529
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,323
after losing Duk-su.

530
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
Your mom

531
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,413
really had no other choice.

532
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,461
She wasn't in any condition
to look after Yun-jae as well.

533
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,720
Why are you only telling me this now?

534
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,433
You see,

535
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,935
I was always terrified of this moment.

536
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,107
The moment
when I had to tell you the truth.

537
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,114
I knew it'd break your heart.

538
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,202
I lacked

539
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,829
as a father,

540
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,294
and your mom was left

541
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,797
to pick up all the burden for too long.

542
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,387
If I had been a more competent husband,

543
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,350
she wouldn't have had
to abandon Yun-jae like that.

544
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,690
Your mother really had no choice.

545
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,360
It was me

546
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,615
who made her make such a cruel decision.

547
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,670
Duk-mi,

548
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,967
I'm ashamed to even say this to you,

549
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,221
but since you're now all grown up,

550
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,057
I think

551
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,268
we can

552
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,270
finally let your mother be at ease.

553
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,150
Would that be all right, Duk-mi?

554
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,198
Duk-mi!

555
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,258
-Duk-mi, hurry!
-Why?

556
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,178
Over there!

557
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,222
Do you want to ride one, Duk-su?

558
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,476
Yes, Giddy-up, horsey!

559
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,731
All right. I'll buy you a turn.

560
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,067
Nice!

561
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,783
DALNIM KINDERGARTEN

562
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,166
Duk-mi!

563
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,709
Duk-su!

564
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,800
Duk-su.

565
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,723
Mom.

566
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,603
Duk-su's hand is so cold.

567
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,871
Duk-su.

568
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,346
Please give her some time.

569
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,849
Give my mom some time to tell Duk-mi.

570
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,687
Also, Duk-mi will need time
to absorb everything.

571
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,773
Duk-mi.

572
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,820
She's tough,
so I'm sure she'll be all right.

573
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,162
Duk-mi.

574
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,875
Mom, I'm sorry.

575
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,919
I'm so sorry.

576
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,006
Don't cry.

577
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,925
Don't you cry.

578
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,029
Mom, I'm sorry for erasing the memories

579
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,615
and making it harder for you.

580
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,241
I was able

581
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,162
to keep it together thanks to you.

582
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,126
Because

583
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,170
you forgot about it all and stayed happy

584
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,215
and because you grew up in the light,

585
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,511
I was able to endure the pain as well.

586
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,681
Still, I'm sorry.

587
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,061
Everyone had to live
with a painful memory,

588
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,897
but only I erased it from my mind.

589
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,775
I'm sorry for being a coward.

590
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,113
At the scene of the accident,

591
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,493
I was told that you wouldn't let go

592
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,286
of Duk-su's hand.

593
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,457
That's why I'm sure

594
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,960
he didn't feel alone
during his last moments.

595
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,212
I know very well

596
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,132
how much you adored
and loved your little brother.

597
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,096
So it's all right.
Everything's all right now.

598
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,932
I remember

599
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,892
everything now.

600
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,938
I remember both Director Gold and Duk-su.

601
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:40,899
Let's not

602
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,945
hold back what we want to say anymore.

603
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,906
We'll talk about Duk-su

604
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,201
and cherish and remember his life.

605
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,998
Thank you, my daughter.

606
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,710
Thank you.

607
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,179
Also

608
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,681
Duk-mi,

609
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,517
Eun-gi...

610
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,397
Eun-gi was young back then too,

611
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,942
but he had to live through Duk-su's death

612
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,820
and you suffering from memory loss.

613
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,156
He had to be strong for all our sake.

614
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,619
Though he never said anything,
I'm sure it took a toll on him too.

615
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,673
Eun-gi.

616
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,926
Thank you

617
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:54,681
for being there for my parents
and comforting them through the pain.

618
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,273
Come to think of it,

619
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,362
you were the one who always had my back,

620
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,823
and I took it for granted.

621
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,910
You are, after all,

622
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,747
my idiotic Eun-gi.

623
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,042
That was me being your fanboy.

624
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,215
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

625
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,384
Are you all right?

626
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,928
No, I'm not.

627
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,142
How did you cope with it all
at that young age?

628
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,231
I could because we're family.

629
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,285
I'm also grateful

630
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,913
to the seven-year-old Eun-gi as well.

631
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,668
The same goes to the 33-year-old Eun-gi

632
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,753
who's here with me now.

633
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,839
I'm sorry too.

634
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,428
Duk-mi, I guess I only told you
that your smile looks pretty

635
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,096
and not the other thing.

636
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,766
You're really ugly when you cry.

637
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,019
You liar.

638
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,980
It's not a lie.

639
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,485
You're going to tell

640
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,071
Director Gold, right?

641
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,325
Then I wish you the best.

642
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,296
-Good morning, Director Gold.
-Good morning.

643
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,093
Oh, I guess Ms. Sung
is running a bit late today.

644
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,095
Please give her some time.

645
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,347
Give my mom some time to tell Duk-mi.

646
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,600
Also, Duk-mi will need time
to absorb everything.

647
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,520
-Let Ms. Sung take today off.
-Good morning.

648
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,234
I'm here, Director Gold.

649
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,111
Duk-mi.

650
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,322
I have something to tell you.

651
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,838
-Duk-mi.
-Director Gold.

652
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,803
Eun-gi told me

653
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,764
that you regained your memory.

654
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,647
It was too hard to bear,
and I didn't know what to do.

655
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,942
-I just wanted to hide.
-Don't do that.

656
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,320
If you do that,
it'll be too hard for me to handle.

657
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,116
But I thought it'd be too hard for you,

658
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,829
so I decided to see you
with a smile on my face.

659
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,874
I thought if we share the pain,

660
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,502
it would be a little better.

661
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,214
Thank you.

662
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,424
My mom...

663
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,720
My mom is here.

664
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,766
She wants to see you in person
and apologize.

665
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,938
My mom...

666
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,065
It's okay, Duk-mi.

667
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,483
It's okay.

668
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,960
I'll be back.

669
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,796
Wait for me.

670
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,123
Duk-mi told me everything.

671
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,499
That your mother

672
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,669
couldn't come because of an accident.

673
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:40,133
I should have taken care of you
a bit longer back then.

674
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,136
If I did, you wouldn't have suffered
for so long.

675
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,771
I'm sorry.

676
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,734
Mother.

677
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:02,280
In Korea, I heard you call
your boyfriend and girlfriend's parents

678
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,700
Mother and Father. Am I right?

679
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:10,080
I've found many mothers in Korea.

680
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,041
I found my real mother

681
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,503
and I can even call you Mother.

682
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,673
I don't deserve

683
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,093
to be called as a mother by you.

684
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,180
I know it's too late to ask
for forgiveness,

685
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,600
but I'm sorry.

686
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,812
If it weren't for you back then,

687
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,858
I would've really been a child abandoned
in a strange neighborhood.

688
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,568
But you took

689
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,947
a strange kid home
and even fed him dinner.

690
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,324
You took care of him.

691
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,415
Thank you.

692
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,592
I know it's too late,

693
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,220
but thank you for taking care of me

694
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,764
and loving me.

695
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,144
I'm really grateful, Mother.

696
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,084
I've decided

697
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,378
to go visit Duk-su

698
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,172
with my mom.

699
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,008
She said

700
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,135
she went every year without me knowing.

701
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,306
Also,

702
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,810
I'll be sorry that my mom sent you
to the orphanage

703
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,189
for the rest of my life.

704
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,866
Duk-mi.

705
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,161
That memory

706
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,084
is a hurtful past
for the seven-year-old Yun-jae,

707
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,087
but it's nothing to me now.

708
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,589
So,

709
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,594
you don't have to be sorry any longer.

710
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,846
Okay?

711
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,559
Good memories

712
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,646
and precious memories.

713
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,651
Give them to me from now on.

714
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,861
Many of them.

715
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,450
I will

716
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,703
love you even more.

717
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,707
So you will become happy now.

718
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,170
I'm already receiving enough love.

719
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,680
And take me with you

720
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,307
to see Duk-su.

721
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:35,577
Okay. Good, hold him tight.

722
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,079
CHOIKANG JUDO

723
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,499
Watch it.

724
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,091
Go!

725
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,097
Mister, when does your class end?

726
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,474
Why are you asking that?

727
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,601
If you're finished with your class,
give me a ride home.

728
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,227
You'll go there anyway.

729
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:07,400
I have a question for you.
Do you think I'm a pushover?

730
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,402
A little bit.

731
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,863
Class is not over yet,
so take the bus home.

732
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,785
By the way, mister.

733
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,413
Stop calling me that.

734
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,792
Can I get a discount here
since we know each other?

735
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,588
Of course you can, ma'am.

736
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,883
You can receive
a special ten percent discount

737
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,552
and an additional ten percent
if you bring a friend with you.

738
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,054
Would you like to register?

739
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,680
No.

740
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,019
Come back here. Hey. You!

741
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,146
COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

742
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,484
I love everything that you cook, Mom.

743
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,408
How could she call her, Mom? Why?

744
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,956
Ma'am, here is
your Family Relation Certificate.

745
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,792
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE

746
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,171
She didn't take her name out of it yet.

747
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,006
-Let's go.
-Where to?

748
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,425
To find my daughter.

749
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,844
Okay.

750
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,313
What did Director Gold say?

751
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:33,111
He said it was okay,
and even comforted me.

752
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,282
I felt so sorry and thankful
at the same time.

753
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,332
Mom?

754
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,627
How did you know I was here?

755
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,006
Did you tail me?

756
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,509
You're the one who kicked me out.
Why are you here?

757
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,511
Hyo-jin.

758
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,055
First, let's go home and talk.

759
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,724
Let's go.

760
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,312
This is my home now!

761
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,523
What do you think about this?

762
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,941
-Well...
-Catch her.

763
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,360
-Let's go. Come!
-Let me go!

764
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,903
-I don't want to go!
-Hey!

765
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,822
Let me go!

766
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,283
I'm so glad that he was able
to meet great parents.

767
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,036
-Come over here!
-I don't want to go!

768
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,662
-What's that sound?
-What's that sound?

769
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,623
I don't want to go! Let me go!

770
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,499
-Mom!
-Open the door!

771
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,418
-I don't want to go!
-Who are you?

772
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,669
-Who are you?
-My goodness.

773
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,588
What do you think you're doing?

774
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,965
Who are you? Why are you trying
to take my daughter?

775
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,551
Hyo-jin is my daughter!

776
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,429
Why do you keep saying
she's your daughter when she's mine?

777
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,389
She's my daughter! Move!

778
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,350
Mr. Kim, tell them to get out of our way!

779
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,684
-Excuse me.
-Move!

780
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:50,438
Hyo-jin is my daughter! Hey, Hyo-jin!
Are you or are you not my daughter?

781
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,439
You're my daughter!

782
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,233
Mr. Kim, what do you think about this?

783
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,110
Move!

784
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,206
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were Hyo-jin's mother.

785
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,166
How could you not know?

786
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,585
We look exactly the same.

787
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,969
Hyo-jin, pack your stuff
and go home with your mom.

788
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,304
Mom.

789
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,224
Why do you keep calling her that?

790
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,687
It was wrong of her
to pack your stuff and kick you out.

791
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:35,024
But now that she's here for you,
it's only right that you go back.

792
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,239
And as for Hyo-jin's mother...

793
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,533
My name is Eom So-hye.

794
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,867
Hyo-jin's mother.

795
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,663
I heard there are people
who don't like being referred

796
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,873
to as somebody's mother.

797
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,377
But maybe it's because
I'm old-fashioned, I like it.

798
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,963
I like it when people call me
Duk-mi's mother.

799
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,091
It feels as if the entire world
is acknowledging the fact

800
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,885
that I'm the mother of my precious child.

801
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,724
But you have to know
that it doesn't last that long.

802
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,768
She may be your precious daughter
whom you gave birth to,

803
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,812
but that only lasts
while she lives with you.

804
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,858
You should be nice to her
while she's by your side.

805
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,444
It's why they say "You never miss
the water until the well runs dry."

806
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,656
Doesn't that proverb apply to our kids?

807
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,242
It means they should be good
to their parents while they're alive.

808
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,410
That goes for both ways.

809
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,288
You need to be good to each other
while you're together.

810
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,541
If you end up falling apart
from each other,

811
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,668
that'll be the end
regardless of how much you regret it.

812
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,839
You can't boss your kid around

813
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,508
and mistreat your family.

814
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,137
Married couples,
parents and children, and siblings.

815
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,848
They're all relationships
based on human connection.

816
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,517
So there's not a single relationship
you should take for granted.

817
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,772
But the fact
that you're still making an effort,

818
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,816
although it might be a bit clumsy,
means that you're okay.

819
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,360
Okay?

820
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,531
Okay?

821
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,951
You really have a way with words.

822
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:11,829
Hyo-jin.

823
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,123
Are you going to come back home now?

824
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:16,751
Yes, I will.

825
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,669
She says she's going to come back home.

826
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,006
She's my daughter. Don't we look alike?

827
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,676
She's pretty because she takes after me.

828
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,682
-Thank you.
-No problem.

829
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,018
I'll visit again.

830
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,396
You're welcome anytime.

831
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,774
Just don't come here
after you fight with your mom.

832
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,781
Bye.

833
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,547
This is a problem.

834
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,715
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

835
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,759
It's too good.

836
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,179
You startled me a little
because there's no way it'd be bad.

837
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,056
Ms. Choi.

838
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,059
Let's also work together
on my next album. Deal?

839
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,688
I'll think about it.

840
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,315
I'm really looking forward
to the exhibition.

841
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,445
How about we use this color

842
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:27,947
to highlight the main wall?

843
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,408
I looked into it
because I also liked this color.

844
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:33,035
But I heard it's going to be hard
to mix the right colors.

845
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,496
-Let's go see when they paint it.
-Okay.

846
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,747
Who are we, everyone?

847
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,332
-The museum guards!
-The museum guards!

848
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,669
-Right. Here are your basic tasks.
-Number one.

849
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,546
Please be careful when you move it.

850
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,839
-Okay.
-Okay.

851
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,062
You must all be exhausted.

852
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,939
Here. Cheer up.

853
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,860
-Here you go, Ms. Yu.
-Thank you.

854
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,238
I'm sorry. This is for women.

855
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,579
There's not much time left,
so let's really put in our all.

856
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,921
Aren't you tired?

857
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,340
A little.

858
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:28,799
But I'm having fun.

859
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,011
I'll finally get to see the exhibition
that we've been planning for so long.

860
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,930
Let's keep the spirit for a little longer.

861
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,682
Okay, I'll do that, Ms. Sung.

862
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,894
Should we go to my place?

863
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,188
I'll go if you buy me something delicious.

864
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,440
There's something even better than that.

865
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,900
What's that?

866
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,070
Your birthday gift is at my place.

867
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,155
Would you like to take it?

868
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,706
Where is it?

869
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,044
Close your eyes.

870
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,130
You're trying to pull a prank, aren't you?

871
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,799
Can I just have it?

872
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:13,469
I listened to you when you asked me
to close my eyes.

873
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,596
Don't you trust me?

874
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,932
That's how you're going to play it?

875
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,768
Okay, I'll keep my eyes closed.

876
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,270
-Follow me.
-Okay.

877
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,532
You don't know
how much I'm looking forward to this.

878
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,326
Don't get too excited though.

879
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,832
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

880
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,157
Director Gold.

881
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,367
I'm...

882
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,456
finally able to paint again.

883
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,045
-I'm a bit rusty, so--
-It's perfect.

884
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,509
I'll practice more.

885
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,136
It's already perfect.

886
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,310
It's perfect.

887
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,759
You also held my hand like this

888
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,055
when we first met.

889
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:22,473
Do you remember?

890
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,894
"Hello."

891
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,522
My name is Sung Duk-mi.

892
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,653
What's your name?

893
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,530
That's what you said.

894
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,243
Do you remember what I said?

895
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,161
My name is

896
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,289
Heo Yun-jae.

897
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,376
"Heo Yun-jae."

898
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,304
Now that I think about it,

899
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,560
the reason I wasn't able to paint
when that was all that I had

900
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,148
was probably
because the universe wanted me

901
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,732
to find something even more precious.

902
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,405
And that's exactly what you are to me.

903
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,938
It took too long

904
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,107
to finally meet you again.

905
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,404
I missed you, Duk-mi.

906
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,909
I missed you, Yun-jae.

907
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:11,832
Hi, Duk-mi.

908
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,420
Hi, Yun-jae.

909
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,630
Didn't you say you had
something important at 5 p.m.?

910
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:00,923
Should we do it together?

911
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,342
My boyfriend has
the hands of the Almighty!

912
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,385
You're so adorable.

913
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,553
A railroad and The Road to Si-an.

914
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,347
Now, call me The Road to Ryan.

915
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,557
Does that mean Ms. Sung needs
to go to the States?

916
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,434
There's no way she'd leave
without Director Gold.

917
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,686
You don't think she'll go, right?

918
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,979
Take care, all right?

919
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,273
You're finally going.

920
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,108
Did you have sweet dreams?

921
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,318
They were sweet
because they were my memories.

922
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,696
However, they were a bit sad too.

923
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:26,448
