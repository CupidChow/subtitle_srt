1
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,124
You have a meeting tomorrow at
11 a.m. regarding the special exhibition.

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,229
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A SPECIAL TOMORROW

3
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,356
TOMORROW, 11 A.M.
MEETING REGARDING THE SPECIAL EXHIBITION

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,692
TOMORROW, SPECIAL

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,903
Are you really just here to work?

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,780
You're totally dressed for a date.

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,406
Well, I won't deny that.

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,825
After telling everyone,
you've become so honest.

9
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,537
The Road to Si-an,
how shall I return your notebook?

10
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,259
I will get back to you later.

11
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,128
That was all one person?

12
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,344
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

13
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,513
I'll join the fanpage.

14
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,183
ENTER NAME

15
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,310
Ryan Gold.

16
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,022
Ryan Gold. Ryan...

17
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,278
NA HUI-YEON

18
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,990
DATE OF BIRTH: APRIL 2ND, 1980

19
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,199
SEX: FEMALE

20
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,201
Since my name is Hui-yeon...

21
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,372
A nickname that I would never use.

22
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,834
A nickname I would never use...

23
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,054
An incident that made me a fan?
"Incident"?

24
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,483
At Incheon International Airport...

25
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
"I got sat on."

26
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,239
That's awesome. I feel jealous.

27
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,830
Oh my gosh!

28
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,172
No, that wasn't an incident.
That was just an accident.

29
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,320
My hair got tangled around the button.

30
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,213
"I'm always here looking at you like this.

31
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,006
Hi."

32
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,973
Hi.

33
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,119
It's so hot.

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,913
Is it a tropical night already or what?

35
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,877
Get lost.

36
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,006
This is driving me nuts.

37
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,889
I shouldn't have followed him
on the business trip. I even overslept.

38
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,331
Ms. Sung.

39
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,293
Director Gold,

40
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,878
hello.

41
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,524
It's bitter.

42
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,484
Is it humid today?

43
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,365
-Ju-hyeok, is it raining outside?
-No, it's not raining.

44
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,825
And I'd like an iced cafe mocha.

45
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,201
Hang on.

46
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,121
-Where's Duk-mi?
-She's not here yet.

47
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,790
She went on a business trip yesterday,
so I think she's sleeping in.

48
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,500
She spent the night there?

49
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,002
What?

50
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,926
Hi, Seon-ju. Hi, Eun-gi.

51
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,512
An iced Americano, please.

52
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,183
What?

53
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,686
I heard you spent the night
with your director on that business trip.

54
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,728
So?

55
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,940
-Did nothing happen?
-What?

56
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,609
How could you think
of spending the night with a man?

57
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,654
Hey, what kind of person
do you think he is?

58
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,990
Director Gold isn't like that.

59
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,451
Even just now,

60
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,413
-a motorbike crashed into his car.
-My goodness.

61
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,790
But he just told him
to drive safely next time

62
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,792
and took him to the hospital.

63
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,295
Since when did you have
so much respect for him?

64
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,300
So did nothing happen between you guys?

65
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,968
No.

66
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,511
What a pity.

67
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,183
Why isn't Ju-hyeok coming?

68
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,934
Ju-hyeok went to the hospital.

69
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,060
-What?
-What?

70
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,063
I just told you that a motorbike
crashed into Director Gold's car.

71
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,778
Didn't I mention that the guy
on the motorbike was Ju-hyeok?

72
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,030
What?

73
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,286
Ryan.

74
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,164
Ryan Gold.

75
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,375
Why is his name Ryan?

76
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,753
It's called a Gestaltzerfall phenomenon.

77
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,088
-Gosh, you startled me.
-That's what it is, right?

78
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,842
-A Gestaltzerfall phenomenon.
-Hallelujah.

79
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,177
If you keep

80
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,847
repeating the same word like you just did,

81
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,724
that word suddenly sounds unfamiliar.

82
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,853
The name "Ryan" sounds really
unfamiliar to you, doesn't it?

83
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,105
No, that's not it.

84
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,360
But why do you look so tired?
Did you stay up all night?

85
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,028
We had to organize the artworks
according to

86
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,905
the international standard
classification system.

87
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,449
We received orders
from that guy named Ryan

88
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,285
when we're really busy
preparing for the exhibit.

89
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,038
We always said we should
get it done one day.

90
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,749
Director Gold really did a great job
of identifying our problem.

91
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,585
The process may be hard, but things
will become easier from now on.

92
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,003
Nothing's easy.

93
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,089
We can't badmouth him anymore

94
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,590
because you're dating him.

95
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,510
And we can't even give work to the intern
because she's Director Eom's daughter.

96
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,304
We're suffering more
than when we were with Director Eom.

97
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,973
I see.

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,101
You don't need to walk on eggshells.
You can badmouth him if you want,

99
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,353
and feel free to give work to the intern.

100
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,438
She needs to be here first.
She needs to come to work.

101
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,398
Isn't she here yet?

102
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,860
-Hyo-jin.
-Yes?

103
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,989
Don't you know what time it is?
Why are you coming to work now?

104
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,157
Aren't you going to hold
a welcoming dinner for me?

105
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,120
Hyo-jin, that's not what you should
be talking about right now.

106
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,038
How about we use my mom's card
to eat some meat?

107
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,040
Sure. I'd love that.

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,460
Then let's all have dinner tonight.
I'll pay with my mom's card.

109
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,715
You all know that
I'm Director Eom's daughter, right?

110
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,466
-Yes.
-Yes.

111
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,760
My mom told me to keep it a secret.

112
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,804
But there are no secrets in this world.

113
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,473
Don't you agree, Ms. Sung?

114
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,069
Here's your iced Americano.

115
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,446
Thank you.

116
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,788
Ju-hyeok, you can go home.

117
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:27,001
I know the doctor said you're fine,
but I'm sure it still hurts.

118
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,004
Don't make me look like a bad boss.
Just go home and rest.

119
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,258
Ju-hyeok?

120
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,512
Ms. Lee.

121
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,307
-Yes?
-Do you have a lot of money?

122
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,892
I think I have more than you.

123
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,812
Then I'll be your slave.

124
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,565
Really?

125
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,692
How much do you cost?

126
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,028
-About 750 thousand won.
-About 750 thousand?

127
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,115
Are you serious? 750 thousand won?

128
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,743
I don't even buy a vacuum cleaner
if it's that expensive.

129
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,119
Then how about 760 thousand?

130
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,788
Are you kidding me?

131
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,040
Director Gold said you don't need
to pay for the repair cost,

132
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,500
and he even paid the hospital fee.

133
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,126
So why do you need that much money?

134
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,190
Only VIP members can read this post.

135
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,901
Please take a test to upgrade your level.

136
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,236
A test?

137
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,702
Please send my notebook
to the following post office box number.

138
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm too busy to go
to the post office these days.

139
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,954
If it's urgent,
you can come get it yourself.

140
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,047
IF IT'S URGENT,
YOU CAN COME GET IT YOURSELF

141
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,822
Mr. Kim.

142
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,449
Director Gold.

143
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,369
-Are you busy?
-That's a sudden question.

144
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,915
Today must've been really hectic for you.

145
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,000
You started the day with a car accident

146
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,793
and even had to go to the hospital.

147
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,255
Yes, I'm really busy today.

148
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,632
Just to let you know,

149
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,551
you can feel free to ask me for help
if you need any.

150
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,095
For example, I can go to the bank for you,

151
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,348
run personal errands,

152
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,391
or go to the post office on your behalf.

153
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,062
Oh, okay. I actually need
to go to the post office.

154
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,772
Really? I'll go.

155
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,904
It's Mr. Cha Si-an.

156
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,489
Cha Si-an?

157
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,826
Yes, he said he'll be here today.

158
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,955
-Right now?
-It seems so.

159
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,208
When can you go to the post office?

160
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,961
I think I should finish
what I was doing first.

161
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,171
I'll go next time.

162
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,759
Yes, Mr. Cha.

163
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,849
Ryan.

164
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,734
What brings you...

165
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,704
I was wondering
if I should attend the meeting

166
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,039
since I'm the head curator.

167
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,890
Bye, then.

168
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,479
What brings you...

169
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,902
Would you like some coffee?

170
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,214
-Excuse me for a second.
-Sure.

171
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,985
Sorry about that.

172
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,154
Please continue.

173
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,241
I wanted to know who else
is participating in the exhibition.

174
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,077
Is it all right for me to ask?

175
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,498
The confirmed participants
are you, the writer, Roh Seok,

176
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,043
the movie director, Moon Seok-chan,
and the ballerina, Oh Yeong-hui.

177
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,046
We're also in contact with others
including three foreign celebrities.

178
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,717
Am I being used as a publicity stunt?

179
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,221
-I hate being on the back burner.
-That's not the case.

180
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,015
Can I be a little more ambitious, then?

181
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,937
The artwork alone
might be a bit too bland.

182
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,731
How about a collaboration
with a visual artist?

183
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,650
Do you have one in mind?

184
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,860
The one I've been working with so far.

185
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,363
From my solo album to this exhibition,

186
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,490
I want to tell a kind of story.

187
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,828
Does it sound weird?

188
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,579
No.

189
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,916
I'm excited since
it sounds unique and refreshing.

190
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,129
We'll continue our meeting
with the artist present, then.

191
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,172
Can you give me the artist's number?

192
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,174
I'll send it along with a profile.

193
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,803
Since I'm here, why don't I take
a look around?

194
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,013
-Let's go, then.
-All right.

195
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,183
Here.

196
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,024
-Si-an, I'm a fan.
-You're so handsome.

197
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,233
Thank you.

198
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,747
"What I thought was a coincidence was fate

199
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,875
and what I believed as fate
turned out to be just a coincidence."

200
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,544
This is great.

201
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,212
Who wrote this?

202
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,173
-I--
-My mom's influence

203
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,216
can easily be seen everywhere.

204
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,387
Oh, dear. It's a secret
that my mom's the former director.

205
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,020
Are you Cha Si-an?

206
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,898
-I am.
-Can I take a photo?

207
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,901
-No photos are allowed--
-Sure thing.

208
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,235
Let me take it for you.

209
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,536
I can't believe I can take a photo of you
so close up without a telephoto lens.

210
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,330
Si-an...

211
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,040
Si-an.

212
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,627
Make sure to take a good photo.

213
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,004
Of course.

214
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,902
Did you hear Cha Si-an
call Director Gold by his name?

215
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,696
Did you know they were that close?

216
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,034
-I'll see you soon then.
-We're having dinner today.

217
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,828
If you have time...

218
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,871
Can I join you guys?

219
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,208
No.

220
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,711
You were cold-hearted at home
but you're even more cold-hearted here.

221
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,588
Have fun today, then.

222
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,528
It's long overdue,

223
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,531
but our new director Ryan Gold

224
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,241
and Ms. Kim Hyo-jin,

225
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,826
welcome to Cheum!

226
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,953
-Welcome!
-Thank you.

227
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,209
How did you become friends with Cha Si-an?

228
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,794
I heard him call you by your name.

229
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,589
Was it because of the dating rumors?

230
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,674
We're not friends per se...

231
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,595
So when did you two start dating?

232
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,598
-What?
-I've been dying to ask that, too.

233
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,433
Who liked who first?

234
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,811
Team dinners are part of work too,
so let's keep it professional--

235
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,731
Ms. Sung, you're ruining the mood.

236
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,401
Director Gold, tell us
how you can date a coworker.

237
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,863
Would you like to tell them, or should I?

238
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,578
The first time we met was at
a Chinese auction house, right?

239
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,999
So you met before he came to work here.

240
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,252
-Back then--
-She said she wanted me.

241
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,253
Sorry?

242
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,048
That's what she said.

243
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,638
Delicate lines
and coherent facial features.

244
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,391
The perfect ratio is very impressive.

245
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,435
I want you.

246
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,565
-I said what?
-Am I wrong?

247
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,737
Yes, you're right. That's what I said.

248
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,782
Ms. Sung, that's very bold of you.

249
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,078
The next time we met
was at a hotel in Korea.

250
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,413
She wanted to come into my hotel room.

251
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,999
Director?

252
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,210
I refused,

253
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,462
but then we met again at the museum.

254
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,258
So that's why you fired her.

255
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,722
I guess he regretted it
because he came by the cafe.

256
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,474
"I'm sorry. I miss you.

257
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,101
Please forgive me."

258
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,271
So you're saying

259
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,898
you'll never come back?

260
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,361
No, I won't.

261
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,240
He apologized with eyes
brimming with tears.

262
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,616
But then

263
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,121
she wouldn't let me go home all night.

264
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,291
All night?

265
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,917
What are you saying?

266
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,921
That night, you wouldn't let me go home

267
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,923
and said you'd only hold my hand.

268
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,059
Is that true?

269
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,897
Yes,

270
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,066
that's how I am.

271
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,153
What about your scandal with Cha Si-an?

272
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,363
-Why didn't you immediately refute?
-Well...

273
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,948
How can he admit to dating a subordinate

274
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,199
-as soon as he arrived?
-Right.

275
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,327
We understand everything, though.

276
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,619
Thanks.

277
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,671
Darn.

278
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,423
Okay, cheers!

279
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,759
-You don't have to drink, you know.
-I'm going to.

280
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,011
Are you watching out for his health?

281
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,266
It's not like that.
He can't drink coffee, so...

282
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,060
I can hold my liquor, though.

283
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,901
My friends taught me a drinking game.

284
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:45,572
The one who takes the longest to receive
a text back from a friend has to drink.

285
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,032
-That sounds like fun.
-Shall we try?

286
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,617
Everyone, take out your phones.

287
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,868
All right.

288
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,705
I'm afraid my phone died, though.

289
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,332
Director Gold!

290
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,294
Didn't you just hear that
your girlfriend's phone is low on battery?

291
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,221
Charge her phone as much as you love her.

292
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,639
Go!

293
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,519
While we wait, let's test how much
you care for each other.

294
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,686
A test?

295
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,897
Answer questions simultaneously.

296
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,650
You'll drink if you say different answers.

297
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,071
Hyo-jin, like I said, team dinners
are part of work, so--

298
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,739
-Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?
-One, two, three.

299
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,949
Jjajangmyeon.

300
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,076
Director Gold!

301
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,412
Right, I'm sorry.

302
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,123
There.

303
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,422
That's it.

304
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,643
He's pretty good at drinking.

305
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,813
-Where did you have your first kiss?
-One, two, three.

306
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,064
-In his office.
-In my car.

307
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,775
-In his office?
-My office?

308
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,611
Who did you kiss in your car then?

309
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,613
We started kissing in his office

310
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,658
and we continued it in his car.

311
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,536
When was your latest kiss then?

312
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,704
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

313
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,038
-Yesterday.
-A while ago.

314
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,879
What we did a while ago was just a peck.

315
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,755
Unbelievable.

316
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,174
Next.

317
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,050
Next.

318
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,022
Welcome, Hyo-jin.

319
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,278
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

320
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
Director Gold.

321
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,996
Director Gold?

322
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,624
Yes, Ms. Sung.

323
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,542
I knew it.

324
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,129
People who were raised abroad
get the most drunk from makgeolli.

325
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,300
Do not ever underestimate makgeolli again.

326
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,886
How about a third round at the karaoke?

327
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,263
No, I'm out. Director Gold!

328
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,057
Director Gold, you should go home.

329
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,144
We'll take Hyo-jin with us and leave.

330
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,564
Hey, let's go.

331
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,816
Let's go, Ms. Intern. This way.

332
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,653
Zero points on the Love Test!

333
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,780
It's suspicious.

334
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,157
It's really suspicious.

335
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,955
Director Gold.

336
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,582
It's that way. Can you walk?

337
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,842
Director Gold...

338
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,686
It's not that I don't like holding hands.

339
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,855
I don't like the moment
when I have to let it go again.

340
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,316
That warm feeling disappears

341
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,735
and it feels like
I'm the only one left in this world.

342
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,194
You don't know at that moment,
but you realize it later.

343
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,071
That the incident was what
made you become a fan.

344
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,034
So you mean it's the stage
when you discover someone

345
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,869
and keep thinking about that person?

346
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,912
Right. Each person experiences

347
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,915
a different incident that makes them
become a fan.

348
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,959
For me, it was a photo
The Road to Si-an took.

349
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,003
It made me feel like we were really
making eye contact,

350
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,504
and it made my heart flutter.

351
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,760
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

352
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,679
I look forward to your show,
Super Fangirl of the 21st Century.

353
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,098
-Me too. Good luck on your ratings.
-Good luck.

354
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,684
-Good night.
-I look forward to your show.

355
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,229
Good job today.

356
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,192
Mr. Kang, wasn't our program

357
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,778
called The Twisted Love of Fanatics?

358
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,364
They'll go crazy if this airs.

359
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,867
If this airs,

360
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,829
I'm as good as dead anyway.

361
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,088
Master.

362
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,091
Here. You didn't have to come
all the way here.

363
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,176
How could I trust you with my credit card?

364
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,929
You should trust me, Master.
I'm yours now.

365
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,847
Stop calling me that!

366
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,142
Why do you play the guitar?

367
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,645
Do you want to become a guitarist?
Or is it just a hobby?

368
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,063
For now, it's a hobby.

369
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,774
And this is the interest for the loan.

370
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,735
Tickets to a performance?
Are you performing?

371
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,862
I thought it was just a hobby.

372
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,614
You never know what can happen in life.

373
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,449
You may never know about life,

374
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,243
but you should know the power of money.

375
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,328
Since you'll have to pay me back
that money.

376
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,503
Isn't that guitar beautiful?

377
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,464
But unlike its looks,
it has a pretty thick tone,

378
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,800
so it's usually used for
rock or heavy metal music.

379
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,430
-What about this?
-This one has a short echo,

380
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,140
and that's one
of the features of this guitar.

381
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,435
It's suitable for funky
or psychedelic music tones.

382
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,270
You must really love guitars.

383
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,106
Your eyes are sparkling.

384
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,444
My eyes sparkled like yours
when I did something I liked, too.

385
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,154
When you were fangirling with your friend?

386
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,280
Yes.

387
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,450
I didn't even notice time passing
when I was fangirling

388
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,660
and I didn't feel tired when
I spent the whole night out.

389
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,037
Your eyes are sparkling
right now too, Master.

390
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,500
-What's this?
-It's an acoustic guitar.

391
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,710
-What about this?
-That, too.

392
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,128
-What's that?
-That's not a guitar.

393
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,171
What's that, then?

394
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,830
You should at least be light if you're
going to get drunk. You're seriously...

395
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,921
handsome.

396
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,153
Drink this right away
if you have a bad hangover.

397
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,871
Director Gold.

398
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,873
Director Gold?

399
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,961
Did I lose my mind?

400
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,425
What on earth is this?

401
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,478
Director Gold?

402
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,563
Knock knock.

403
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,399
-What's the passcode?
-Passcode?

404
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,694
The passcode is

405
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,571
a secret.

406
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,659
Then come here and press it yourself.

407
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,871
Are you getting angry at me right now?

408
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,166
Of course not.
I'm asking you very politely.

409
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,628
Tell me the passcode,
or come and press it yourself.

410
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,257
All right.

411
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,176
I'll tell you.

412
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,014
-If you sing a song for me.
-A song?

413
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
Here?

414
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,198
Okay. I'll sing a song for you,

415
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,033
so tell me the passcode, okay?

416
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,953
-You promise?
-I promise.

417
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,621
-You better not change your mind.
-Okay.

418
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,517
A runway spreads out
A highway opens for me

419
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,726
I walk along it

420
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,186
Click, click, snapshot

421
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,938
Click, click, snapshot

422
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,341
You've really lost your mind.

423
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,246
Sweet dreams.

424
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,936

00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,623
When did Si-an make his debut?
Please write down

00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,875
the year, month, and date in order.

DATE OF HIS DEBUT
MAY 23, 2014

433
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,512
The next question is about White Ocean's

434
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,472
albums and songs.

435
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,516
In White Ocean's first album,

436
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,393
there are album credits and thank-yous.

437
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,062
Write down the birthday of the member
that mentioned Si-an

438
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,065
and what he exactly said to him.

439
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,441
What?

440
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,152

443

write down the colors of all the
pants that Si-an wore on Y Live..."

444
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,250
The color of the pants he wore?

445
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,627
They want me to write them down
in the order of episodes?

446
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,594
Y LIVE

708 RECOMMENDED VIDEOS

449
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,979
What? 708 videos?

450
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,725
Here's the last question.

451
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,186
Si-an always covers the mole near his lips

452
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,396
because he doesn't like it.

453
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,524
Please draw on the photo to indicate

454
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,109
exactly where that mole is located.

455
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,695
Where is that mole? Where is it?

456
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,198
Why can't I find it anywhere?

457
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,867
Why can't I see it?
All those photos I saw...

458
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,370
I looked at thousands of photos.

459
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,955
Where is it?

460
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,289
Hey, Ryan.

461
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,838
Where is it?

462
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,340
Ryan?

463
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,889
I guess it was a shadow.

464
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,100
I thought something was on your face.

465
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,560
People used to say that a lot
back when I had a mole.

466
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,896
When you "had" a mole?
You don't have it now?

467
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,148
-I got rid of it.
-You got rid of it?

468
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,692
Why would you get rid of it?

469
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,402
Do you know how much
your fans love that mole?

470
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,029
That's why I secretly got rid of it.
I never really liked that mole.

471
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,240
But if you look close enough,
you'll still be able to see it.

472
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,825
Where? Let me see.

473
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,827
Right here.

474
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,375
The mole on his face...

475
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,755
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

476
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,302
This person is unbelievable.

477
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,803
Why? What's wrong?

478
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,638
This person joined the fanpage yesterday.

479
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,308
But she applied for the test today
and got everything right.

480
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,726
Really? Who is it?

481
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,436
Latte.

482
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,563
Isn't this a record?

483
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,816
Do you think someone leaked
our test questions?

484
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,819
Come on. She's probably just
a really huge fan like us.

485
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,339
-Oh, right. Ryan.
-Yes?

486
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,631
Meet me today after work.

487
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,717
I found another one
of Lee Sol's paintings.

488
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,232
I found another one
of Lee Sol's paintings.

489
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,898
Mom.

490
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,936
Is Hyo-jin going to skip work today
because she drank last night?

491
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,523
Imagine how happy you'd be
working just for leisure.

492
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,569
I'll make sure
to scold her properly today.

493
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,487
My gosh.

494
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,615
Please look to your left.

495
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,160
-What's going on?
-You're so pretty. Have a good day.

496
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,619
You're so pretty today.

497
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,371
You look like a butterfly.

498
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,999
You're going to scold her?

499
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,626
Director Eom.

500
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,303
I didn't want to make it too obvious,

501
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:16,348
but my husband really wanted to see photos

502
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,311
of Hyo-jin going to work
and photos of her working here.

503
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,980
The thing is, my husband

504
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,566
cares so much about Hyo-jin.

505
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,568
But that doesn't mean

506
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,237
you guys should feel pressured. Okay?

507
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,323
Okay, we won't feel pressured at all.

508
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,701
By the way, I think my husband needs
to change the painting

509
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:39,079
that's on his office wall right now.

510
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,831
Do you have a specific painting in mind?

511
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,835
I think this year is
a pretty bad year for him.

512
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,462
He's getting disgraced often.

513
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,047
So I think he should hang a painting

514
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,300
that can help him block
the bad luck that comes to him.

515
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,719
Maybe a lion or...

516
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,686
I have a meeting with Mr. Cha today,
so I'm going to go home now.

517
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,649
Ms. Sung, don't call me
if it isn't anything urgent.

518
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,192
I'm here.

519
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,531
I really don't like lions.

520
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,826
Get me a painting of a tiger.

521
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,671
Ms. Sung, did you have a fight
with Director Gold?

522
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,631
He seemed to be in a bad mood.

523
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,509
Did you nag him
about drinking a lot yesterday?

524
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,803
Nag him? Fight?

525
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,930
That's nonsense.

526
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,378
You have three of Lee Sol's paintings.

527
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,381
Yes, only one of them aired on TV.

528
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,383
And I found this one recently.

529
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,886
I have three, and you also bought one
on behalf of your client.

530
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,265
That means if we find five more,
we'll have the entire collection.

531
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,891
Five more?

532
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,353
Are you saying there are
nine paintings in total?

533
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,106
How do you know that?

534
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,816
There's no information about Lee Sol.

535
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,486
I heard it somewhere.

536
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,947
I think we might be able to collect

537
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,366
all of her paintings
before the exhibition.

538
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,827
Do you still keep in contact
with your client?

539
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:43,954
Yes.

540
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,166
We should ask the client
if we can borrow the painting.

541
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,793
It'd be even better if I could buy it.

542
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,841
Go ahead and take a look.

543
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,801
Hey, Mom.

544
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,351
Isn't Director Gold eating?

545
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,353
He doesn't have an appetite.

546
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,313
Did you two break up?

547
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,233
Why would they
when they just started to date?

548
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,949
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

549
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,537
Hold on a second.

550
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,291
Didn't she just finish an entire bowl?

551
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,752
She's buying some for Director Gold.

552
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,837
It's their honeymoon phase.

553
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,966
Director Gold.

554
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,970
Ryan.

555
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,936
I hope what I'm seeing isn't real.

556
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,729
You still only drink milk, right?

557
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,944
Curator Sung Duk-mi?

558
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,988
I'm sorry I only bought his.

559
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,447
No, it's all right.

560
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,826
Can you hold this for me?

561
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,332
I missed you, Ryan.

562
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,167
You have three seconds.

563
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,336
Why? You said you missed me, too.

564
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,047
Three, two...

565
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,301
Two seconds would've sufficed.

566
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,304
What's going on? You didn't even call.

567
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,681
I don't have a phone yet.

568
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,017
Let's talk more as we walk.

569
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,768
-Are we going somewhere?
-My studio.

570
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,811
Your studio?

571
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,396
In Korea?

572
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,816
You're curious, right?
Let's go. Where's your car?

573
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,778
Is it that way?

574
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,456
I missed you, Ryan.

575
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,834
Ms. Sung.

576
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,629
-What?
-I'm sorry.

577
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,967
Sorry about that.
I was lost in thought. What is it?

578
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,220
The manager of Director Gold's
apartment building

579
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,264
just called.

580
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,683
-And?
-The unit above has a water leak,

581
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,395
so he wants to check
Director Gold's residence, too.

582
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,605
A water leak?

583
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,024
He probably has some artwork at home.

584
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,151
Have they tried contacting him?

585
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,154
I hear he's not picking up.

586
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,490
He's not picking up? Why?

587
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,034
Yes, I get it.

588
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,410
Thank you.

589
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,248
Pyeongchang-dong?
Let's check that area first.

590
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,875
I thought we were going to your studio.

591
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,294
I'm looking for one today.

592
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,421
I'll use this a while longer.

593
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,220
Ms. Sung.

594
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:37,516
Shouldn't you go to his house
to check instead?

595
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,434
But I'm not the owner.

596
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,395
You're the owner's girlfriend.

597
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,814
Girlfriend, my foot...

598
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,154
That's exactly who I am.

599
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,992
It's an urgent matter, so it'll be fine.

600
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,412
I'll tell the building manager

601
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,288
and leave Director Gold a text.

602
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,457
You know his door lock passcode, right?

603
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,752
What? Yes, of course.

604
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,841
I guess I should go, then.

605
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,052
-Call me if something comes up.
-Sure.

606
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,685
They enjoy all the romance

607
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,229
while I'm left to do the dirty work.

608
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,153
The former occupant
was also a famous artist.

609
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,114
Things worked out well,
so he moved overseas.

610
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,533
The location must bring luck.

611
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,079
I need to get this.
Please take a look around.

612
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,500
I like it.

613
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,294
What do you think?

614
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,964
Why do you need a studio?
How long are you staying in Korea?

615
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,133
How long will you be staying?

616
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,512
Have I ever sent you mixed signals?

617
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,514
I don't remember doing so.

618
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:03,894
You never did,
but you do make my heart flutter.

619
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,187
Da-in.

620
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,272
It's just that

621
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,108
I've had a lot in my mind these days.

622
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,361
About half of the reviews are compliments

623
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,238
while the other half are criticisms.

624
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,242
Am I an artist or a fraud?

625
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,744
Even I'm doubting myself.

626
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,247
-That's--
-I know it's nonsense.

627
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,876
"Compliments and criticisms.
Never take both too seriously."

628
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,377
That's what you told me.

629
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,172
Nobody can do that so easily, though.

630
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,510
I need someone to establish
a standard for me.

631
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,055
Someone who can honestly evaluate my work.

632
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,934
Someone who will give heartfelt advice
for me and my work.

633
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,188
That's the kind of person
I desperately need as an artist.

634
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,941
Someone like you.

635
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,239
I desperately want you as a woman as well.

636
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,952
I'll help you with your art but that's it.

637
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,537
That's mean.

638
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,373
Wait, I still have your phone.

639
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,170
A water leak?

640
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,132
I'll see you around.

641
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,509
Ryan!

642
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,595
What's going on?

643
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,891
Thankfully, nothing's wrong.

644
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,643
Thank you.

645
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,531
Things were too hectic
to take a proper look last time,

646
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,325
but his house is like an art gallery, too.

647
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,245
It's pretty.

648
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,504
This is nice.

649
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,721
Director Gold.

650
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,106
What are you doing here?

651
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,026
I heard there was a leak upstairs,

652
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,320
-so I came to check--
-I think you're done checking.

653
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,203
I'm asking what you're doing in
an empty home without its owner.

654
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,624
I was...

655
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,003
Your house was just so beautiful, so...

656
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,257
Does that give you permission
to look around as you like?

657
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,304
Do you actually think
we're really dating or something?

658
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,060
Are you pretending you came over
to your boyfriend's house or what?

659
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,231
-It's not that, I just--
-Please leave,

660
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,025
Ms. Sung.

661
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,573
I'm sorry.

662
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,987
Wait. Aren't you Ms. Sung?

663
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,491
Si-an, I mean, Mr. Cha Si-an.

664
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,079
So we're meeting
in the elevator this time.

665
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,001
But is something wrong?

666
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,336
Did you have a fight with Ryan?

667
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,089
No, it's not that.

668
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,841
Did he do something wrong?

669
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,802
Did he lie?

670
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,180
Are you familiar with Lee Sol's work?

671
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,183
No,

672
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,019
I was buying the artwork for a client.

673
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,733
He's probably regretting it, too.

674
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,029
Cheer up, okay?

675
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,909
Director Gold, I couldn't come
empty-handed, so I brought a gift.

676
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,453
I hope you like the scent.

677
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,457
-It's not that, I just--
-Please leave,

678
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,335
Ms. Sung.

679
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,883
I'm sorry.

680
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,227
Drink this right away
if you have a bad hangover.

681
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,937
Sweet dreams.

682
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,940
If you ever want to hold someone's hand,

683
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,359
or if you don't want to let go,

684
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,945
I'll let you borrow my hand.

685
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,037
How could Si-an be
so understanding and kind?

686
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,330
Right, Duk-mi?

687
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,873
He yelled at you?

688
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,875
He should've thanked you.

689
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,169
And? What else did Si-an say?

690
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,004
Is that something to get angry about?

691
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,298
You should've just said you lied
in order not to make trouble.

692
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,343
Doesn't Si-an seem like such
a sympathetic guy?

693
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,554
Hey. Where's your sense of
sympathy right now?

694
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,014
You little punk.

695
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,226
Just get everything out of you.

696
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,187
You can swear about
that Lion jerk all you want.

697
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,024
Do you know what I hate the most?

698
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,945
In that situation...

699
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,114
When Lion was yelling at me like crazy,

700
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,368
I was worried he might be
disappointed in me

701
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,578
and that he'd hate me.

702
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,205
That's what scared me more.

703
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,376
I'm such a loser.

704
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,881
Sung Duk-mi,

705
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,259
just stick to fangirling.

706
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:18,388
Don't ever fall for a guy
in the real world.

707
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,742
Hey, he's really Ju-hyeok?

708
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,135
Didn't she tell you not to fall for guys
in the real world?

709
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,762
Life doesn't always go the way you want.

710
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,742
Director Gold.

711
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,578
What brings you here this late?

712
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,081
By any chance, have you seen Ms. Sung?

713
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,500
She had some work outside
the office this afternoon,

714
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,669
and I think she went straight home.

715
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,796
Okay.

716
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,567
S came out of R's house.

717
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,946
She went to UG Club in Hongdae
right away with another guy

718
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,489
to enjoy a date watching a performance.

719
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,754
Wasn't that amazing?

720
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:57,714
Excuse me.

721
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,590
Is the performance over?

722
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,426
-Yes, it's over.
-Yes.

723
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,750
Does that give you permission
to look around as you like?

724
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,711
Do you actually think
we're really dating or something?

725
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,425
Are you pretending you came over
to your boyfriend's house or what?

726
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,388
Please leave, Ms. Sung.

727
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,506
Ms. Sung!

728
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,470
Director Gold.

729
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,639
I was out of line.

730
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,476
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.

731
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,438
I was just really taken aback.

732
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,276
I'm sorry.

733
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,240
Are you

734
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,659
angry at me?

735
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,744
Yes.

736
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,836
But...

737
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,009
I'm also sorry

738
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,764
for entering your house
without permission.

739
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,989
-Do you love Duk-mi?
-Yes.

740
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,782
So don't come out.

741
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,660
I heard you're dating Ms. Sung.
Is it true?

742
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,621
I don't think I need to answer that.

743
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,623
Hey. You should get ready for a wedding.

744
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,459
This is why it's bad
to date someone at work.

745
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,920
There's something you'd be happy to hear.

746
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:24,879
What is it?

747
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:25,796
Actually, I...

748
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,300
If I didn't run into him that day,
I wouldn't be feeling so guilty.

749
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,677
But why can't I see yours?

750
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,429
No!

751
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,849
