1
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,330
I guess we share a special relationship.

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,460
You and I.

3
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,672
Listen.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,258
We both like Lee Sol's paintings.

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,052
Twenty-seven thousand.

6
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,138
Twenty-nine. Thirty thousand dollars.

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,347
Hey, mister!

8
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,351
That artwork you just bid for,
please yield it to me.

9
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,606
We live in the same apartment.

10
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,734
Do you work here?

11
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,111
May I help you?

12
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,239
The artist I like is an acquaintance
of yours.

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,866
Are we meeting an artist?

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,326
We're meeting a collector.

15
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,037
It's Cha Si-an of White Ocean.

16
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,123
What?

17
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,545
The jacket. We even have
the same jacket, remember?

18
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,799
Wear this.

19
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,384
Although that jacket led to a problem,

20
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,053
this isn't a coincidence.

21
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,596
It must be fate.

22
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,739
Here you are.

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,784
-Thank you.
-Sure.

24
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,661
What about Ms. Sung?

25
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,371
She went to the workshop.

26
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,207
They said they need to deliver some wood,
but no one's at the workshop.

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,500
So?

28
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,087
I didn't ask her to go.
Ms. Sung said she'd go herself.

29
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,590
She should be a part of this meeting.
Why go to the workshop?

30
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,342
Is she not feeling well?

31
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,679
Ms. Sung looked troubled today.

32
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,515
What time is the meeting

33
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,641
with Mr. Cha and Ms. Choi?

34
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,351
It's at 2 p.m.

35
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,146
-Then at 1 p.m. in the parking lot--
-Actually,

36
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,440
I have a meeting outside
prior to that one.

37
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,651
I'll head to her studio from there.

38
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,158
If Si-an can't make you smile, that means

39
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,578
you're actually really sick.

40
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,834
It was the first time I saw Ms. Sung
without a smile.

41
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,003
She was smiling every time I saw her.

42
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,047
So I thought she was my fan.

43
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,721
-Please continue with the meeting.
-What?

44
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,432
-Ryan.
-Hey.

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,353
Is he going to see Ms. Sung?

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,867
She should've told me if she was sick.

47
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,626
FURNITURE WORKSHOP

48
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,609
Ms. Sung?

49
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,182
Ms. Sung.

50
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,895
Director Gold.

51
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,070
I didn't want to ask you.

52
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,407
I really didn't want to ask you this.

53
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,331
What was so hard for you?

54
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,793
About being in a fake relationship
with me.

55
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,928
Did you hate it that much?

56
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,061
Yes.

57
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,733
What did you hate so much about it?

58
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,943
I didn't call you every day

59
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,737
or ask you to meet me.

60
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,197
All you had to do

61
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,700
was pretend for a short moment.

62
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,286
Was it that hard

63
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,246
and stressful for you?

64
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,046
I was so excited and happy.

65
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,216
-What was so--
-Because it was fake.

66
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,903
I hated it because it was fake.

67
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,659
I wanted to date you for real.

68
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,269
Hello?

69
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,271
Anyone here?

70
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,024
Is anyone here? Excuse me.

71
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,199
Hello?

72
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,163
Is no one here?

73
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,512
The exhibition is in two months,
so we're quite tight on schedule.

74
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,097
What will you be exhibiting?

75
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,432
Here.

76
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,601
ARTWORK OWNED BY CHA SI-AN

77
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,312
Director Gold also likes this painting.

78
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,647
There are nine paintings in total.

79
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,398
I want to collect them all
and exhibit them.

80
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,654
-Just a second. I'm sorry.
-Okay.

81
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,659
No one's at the workshop,
so I'll just have to leave.

82
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,950
-You must be hungry.
-That wasn't me.

83
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,785
You're hungry even in this situation?

84
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,287
I just said it wasn't me.

85
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,249
My stomach's just digesting
because I drank coffee earlier.

86
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,631
-Should we get something to eat?
-Yes.

87
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,111
Wait.

88
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,160
What's that?

89
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,121
A flashlight. It's just a flashlight.

90
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,082
-A flashlight?
-Yes.

91
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,336
-It's pretty.
-Right?

92
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,304
Editor Nam.

93
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,474
You should've opened a bookstore,
not a publishing company.

94
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,312
Moment magazines are right here.

95
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,315
I was wondering why we had
a sudden increase in sales.

96
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,609
It must be thanks to Director Gold.

97
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,988
He really is just the right person
for Duk-mi.

98
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,283
Mom, what about me?

99
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,951
What do you mean?

100
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,787
Wouldn't I be good for Duk-mi as well?

101
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,332
That's a horrible joke...

102
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,129
Eun-gi.

103
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,631
I'm the only guy

104
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,092
who knows Duk-mi

105
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,094
better than herself.

106
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,275
I went there to check the wood, though.

107
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,195
I feel so guilty.

108
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,740
Maybe we should've gone back
to her studio for the meeting.

109
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,659
-Mr. Cha--
-What did you like about me?

110
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,785
Pardon?

111
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,370
When did you get excited and happy?

112
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,580
I don't know what you mean.

113
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,418
That's what you said earlier.

114
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,297
I wonder when it all began.

115
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,427
Was it when we took photos
of our fake relationship?

116
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,679
Or was it

117
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,223
at Mr. Roh's cabin?

118
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,184
Or was it when you blindfolded me

119
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,270
-at your place?
-Director Gold.

120
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,231
Do you want gimbap?

121
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,443
I'm craving gimbap because I didn't
get to have any last time.

122
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,027
So why don't we eat gimbap?

123
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,904
-Gimbap?
-Gimbap.

124
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,698
-Cheongyang chili gimbap?
-Yes.

125
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,080
Ta-da.

126
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,170
By the way, it's spicy.

127
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,267
Haven't you cleaned your place yet?

128
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,604
-Are you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

129
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,401
So I guess this is
the night view of Seoul.

130
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,571
Isn't the night view a lot better
from your place?

131
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,074
I'm not sure.

132
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,078
To be honest, I moved here
because I also liked this view.

133
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,497
It's a penthouse.

134
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,707
A penthouse?

135
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,627
Next time you move,

136
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,213
you should get a place with an elevator.

137
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,216
Do you want one?

138
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,426
Why not? Try one.

139
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,970
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
It's okay.

141
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,267
You already ruined
a handful of my clothes.

142
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,478
Didn't I

143
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,813
only ruin two?

144
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,485
Why are you so bad with chopsticks
when you're Korean?

145
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,696
What? I'm really good at using chopsticks.

146
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,949
You must think you're good.

147
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,243
-Are you good?
-I'm really good.

148
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,371
-You call this good?
-Of course.

149
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,040
Did that work back when you were abroad?

150
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,717
-Go home safely, Editor Nam.
-Eun-gi.

151
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,347
I'm...

152
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,432
sorry.

153
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,060
All of a sudden?

154
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,187
About what?

155
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,022
I didn't know.

156
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,110
I can't believe I didn't know
my own son's feelings.

157
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,029
But then again, I never really
raised you myself.

158
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,449
If I knew you had feelings
for Duk-mi, I would've--

159
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,534
Mom.

160
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,745
I didn't know either.

161
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,710
I found out pretty recently.

162
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,130
I was stupid.

163
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,264
So just root for me
instead of feeling sorry.

164
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,724
Okay?

165
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,853
I'll be off now.

166
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,410
I'll talk to Ms. Choi and Mr. Cha
tomorrow and explain.

167
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,745
Okay, Director Gold.

168
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,708
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes, Director Gold?

169
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,669
Duk-mi.

170
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,464
Yes, Director Gold.

171
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,305
We're in a relationship now, right?

172
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,974
We're no longer faking it.
This is for real, right?

173
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,144
In Korea, if you don't go out
with the person you kiss, you go to jail.

174
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,481
Of course, we're in a relationship.

175
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,443
It's just that you sounded
really formal just now.

176
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,656
How about we call each other by our names?

177
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,033
Ryan?

178
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,289
Wait, that's a little...

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,877
I wonder if there's a friendly nickname
you can use.

180
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,630
A friendly nickname? I could call you...

181
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,967
Lion, that jerk.

182
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,558
I'll just call you more comfortably
from now on.

183
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,686
I'll see you tomorrow.

184
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,146
I hated it because it was fake.

185
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,984
I wanted to date you for real.

186
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,503
It'd be nice if I could have
a video footage of my memory.

187
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
I want to keep replaying it.

188
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,176
I want to take a screenshot of it.

189
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,013
I'll screen capture it,
photoshop it, and create a GIF.

190
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,251
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

191
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,254
Latte, that person you like
might not be toying with your heart.

192
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,131
Maybe that person just took a step back

193
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,384
because she didn't know how you felt
and didn't want to get hurt.

194
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,471
To be honest,

195
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,473
that's what I did.

196
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,061
So try mustering up your courage
one more time. Good luck.

197
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,084
Thank you, The Road to Si-an.

198
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,683
-Seon-ju.
-Duk-mi, look at this.

199
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,393
Seung-min bought me a purse.

200
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,727
Really? It's pretty.

201
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,272
He placed it in a locker
as a surprise gift.

202
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,357
Really? That's so clever of him.

203
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,609
I wouldn't be with him if he weren't.

204
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,154
-My husband--
-I'm dating the Lion.

205
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,907
-What?
-I told you

206
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,993
that he seemed to like me, too.

207
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,541
I want to know what happened
in detail, so spill.

208
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,344
"I wanted to date you for real."

209
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,682
Gosh, you're all grown up now.

210
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,895
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

211
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,355
-Have you told Eun-gi?
-No, not yet.

212
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,107
Then let's not tell him
for the time being.

213
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,442
Why not?

214
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,654
Once he finds out,
he'll tell your parents.

215
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,281
Are you sure you can handle that?

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,243
No, I can't. It can't happen.

217
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,454
I shouldn't tell Eun-gi just yet.

218
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,331
You shouldn't tell him, either.

219
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,378
Ju-hyeok, can I get
and iced latte with condensed milk?

220
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,546
Takeout!

221
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,264
Have you had your coffee yet?

222
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,891
I got this for you.

223
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,268
Iced Americano with an extra shot.

224
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,270
How did you know my coffee order?

225
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,521
I asked your friend.

226
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,524
Well, this is for you.

227
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,073
This has no caffeine in it,
just condensed milk and my sincerity.

228
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,456
How is it?

229
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,334
It's tasty.

230
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,391
You're slightly late to work.

231
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,393
Actually, I'm on time.

232
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,021
Was I the only one who missed you?

233
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,898
What do you mean?

234
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,068
Why don't I camp out here tonight then?

235
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,444
I'll stay up all night.

236
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,489
-Can I join you?
-What?

237
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,702
I've never slept in a tent before.

238
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,203
Is that an American thing?

239
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,457
FIRST BIRTHDAY

240
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,594
Son, when did you get home?

241
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,597
I told you to leave
the heavy lifting to me.

242
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,392
Why would I bother my son who earns money

243
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,519
when I have a husband
who carries heavy stones every day?

244
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,272
I still have some muscles, you know.

245
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,443
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

246
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,986
Mom,

247
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,863
is my suit around?

248
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,198
Your suit? Are you attending a wedding?

249
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,078
Rather than be happy
to attend someone else's,

250
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,205
you should think about
getting married yourself. It's here.

251
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,708
Let me see if I had it dry-cleaned.

252
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,358
What's with Ms. Sung today?

253
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,236
I have a bad feeling about this.

254
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,488
A bad feeling?

255
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,699
Could Ms. Sung and Director Gold
have made up?

256
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,077
No way.

257
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,828
No way!

258
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,835
Ms. Sung?

259
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,381
-Yes, Director Gold.
-Let's begin the meeting.

260
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,800
Shall we?

261
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,098
Come on. Let's go.

262
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,021
See? They're together again.

263
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,690
Has the timer reset on the bomb then?

264
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,117
Where are we with
Mr. Ahn's other artworks?

265
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,953
We need approval from the donor
to get the pieces

266
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,456
that Ullim Art Gallery agreed to lend us,
so it'll take some time.

267
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,875
Unfortunately,
the donor is vacationing abroad.

268
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,586
We'll set up a meeting
once the donor gets back.

269
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,257
Great.

270
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,428
Next, we'll talk about
the museum merchandise.

271
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,555
Hyo-jin,

272
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,598
where are we on that?

273
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,517
Brace yourselves.

274
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,480
SI-AN

275
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,149
What's that?

276
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,109
A cheer stick for Si-an's fans.

277
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,820
I thought we could add

278
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,364
the museum's logo or its name.

279
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,741
It even lights up.

280
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,036
It kind of looks like

281
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,747
a flashlight, doesn't it, Ms. Sung?

282
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,168
Is there a flashlight
that looks like this?

283
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,962
-Ms. Sung has--
-Hyo-jin,

284
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,090
I don't think museum
and exhibition merchandise

285
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,342
should be like K-pop merchandise.

286
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,094
Then

287
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,682
how about a cushion
with Si-an's photo printed on it?

288
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,186
Or we can make soap.

289
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,105
Ta-da! Here's a key chain.

290
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,068
Don't you like them?

291
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,323
Seriously?

292
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,533
Are there any more options?

293
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,131
"My Own Mini Art Gallery."

294
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,677
We'll make miniature-sized copies
of the artwork.

295
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,097
With them, you can
set up your own mini gallery.

296
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,225
IT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND!

297
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,686
I like it.

298
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,647
Really?

299
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,526
We could start with the special exhibition

300
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,196
and apply it to the ones in the future.

301
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,825
See? I told you
merchandising was my specialty.

302
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,287
-Ms. Yu.
-Yes?

303
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,582
Please manage our intern
so that her enthusiasm

304
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,334
and confidence never go over the line.

305
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,794
Sure thing.

306
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,296
That'll be all, then.

307
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,270
What is it?

308
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,063
Ms. Sung,

309
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,315
are you back with Director Gold?

310
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,736
Not exactly.
Truth be told, it's our first...

311
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,906
You'll start dating again
like it's your first time?

312
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,616
Yes, I'm sure his words might seem sweet.

313
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,495
Just so you know though,
people can't be fixed.

314
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,497
I'll just get it fixed.

315
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
A study shows

316
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,502
that reconnected couples
break up for the same reason.

317
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,338
The bottom line is that Director Gold
is a filthy, busted car.

318
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,673
A filthy, busted car.

319
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,509
You're too enamored by his good looks

320
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,761
to smell how filthy it is.

321
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,390
Gosh, that smells good.

322
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,314
Men who get by on good looks
never change their ways.

323
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,816
There are men like me
who choose not to act that way.

324
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,067
Exactly.

325
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,531
Ms. Yu, Yu-seop, remember this.

326
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,577
You can badmouth me all you want,
but my Lion...

327
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,997
I won't let you speak ill
of Director Gold.

328
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,417
I know you're worried about me,

329
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,169
but you're wrong about who he is.

330
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,421
-Ms. Sung!
-I'm not kidding,

331
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,214
so say no more.

332
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,139
Ms. Sung, is Ryan inside?

333
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,226
If you're here for a meeting,
I can get you a beverage.

334
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,730
Actually, I'm here
for a private conversation.

335
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,157
Are you all right?

336
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,327
Yes, of course.

337
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,747
I'm really sorry

338
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,041
about yesterday.

339
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,794
I didn't check the meeting
or the wood properly.

340
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,295
This will never happen again.

341
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,465
What about Ms. Sung?

342
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,300
Did you make up with her?

343
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,928
We never fought in the first place.

344
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,557
I guess you ended the fake relationship.

345
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,560
Yes.

346
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,562
What did you think of Mr. Cha?

347
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,606
I like him.

348
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,192
He's more sincere than I thought.

349
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,820
I like his music, too.
I'm looking forward to it.

350
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,322
-I'm glad to hear that.
-But I found something strange.

351
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,909
The painting Mr. Cha wants to exhibit.

352
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,161
Isn't it that painting?

353
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,038
The one you bought
at the gallery in New York.

354
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,544
You have a good memory.

355
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,589
The reason Mr. Cha must participate
in the exhibition,

356
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,592
and the reason you asked me
desperately for the first time.

357
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,720
Is it because of this painting?

358
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,474
Who is Lee Sol?

359
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,351
I feel grateful for this.

360
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,855
Good luck on the special exhibition
with Mr. Cha.

361
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,027
What a hard way to say "Don't ask."
You're making me uncomfortable.

362
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,323
Ms. Choi.

363
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,703
I look forward to your
collaboration with Mr. Cha.

364
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,164
Okay. I'll look forward to seeing

365
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,791
how long your relationship
with Ms. Sung will last.

366
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,293
Are you cursing me?

367
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,462
I said I'm looking forward to it.

368
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,922
But...

369
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,093
How can you not even ask?

370
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,139
About how I remember something about you

371
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,849
from three years ago.

372
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,143
Aren't you curious?

373
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,315
-Da-in, I--
-See you.

374
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,972
I'm not going to apologize

375
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,391
since it wasn't a lie.

376
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,395
Ryan wanted to end the fake relationship.

377
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,355
Because

378
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,316
he wanted to date for real.

379
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,237
Distorting the truth
is also a lie, Ms. Choi.

380
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,157
You must've believed my words

381
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,992
more than Ryan's feelings for you.

382
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,675
-Seon-ju.
-Yes?

383
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,387
Who would you choose between me and Lion?

384
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,640
What's wrong with you?

385
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,058
Are you taking after Ju-hyeok?

386
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,602
Eun-gi, I don't break cups these days.

387
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,479
I'm proud of you.

388
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,565
Move. I'll clean that up.

389
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,822
-I feel a bit dizzy lately.
-Move.

390
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,412
She's lucky she was born rich.

391
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,540
Welcome.

392
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,335
Can I order?

393
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,504
Yes. Welcome.

394
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,882
That pathetic guy?

395
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,509
-How could you be so rude?
-Do you know how...

396
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,637
Do you know how humiliated
I was because of you?

397
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,015
What did I say?

398
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,226
You said Ryan and Ms. Sung
were in a fake relationship.

399
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,897
And?

400
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,941
-You must not have heard.
-Eun-gi.

401
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,068
Geon-u.

402
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,154
It's time for him to
go to the Judo studio.

403
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,116
You're unusually obsessed
with being punctual today.

404
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,082
I'm a director of a Judo studio.
I'm not pathetic.

405
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,213
When you have a foul personality,
working out is the answer. Okay?

406
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,258
Geon-u, it's time to go
to the Judo studio.

407
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,927
Yes, Mr. Nam!

408
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,228
May I take your order?

409
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,772
I'd like an Americano.

410
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,731
But...

411
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,192
Who are you?

412
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,319
Sorry?

413
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,656
Geon-u, attention!

414
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,532
Like a real man.

415
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,117
March forward.

416
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,996
One, two.

417
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,333
One, two, three. There you go.

418
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,419
Mr. Nam, what is that?

419
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,379
That?

420
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,214
It's my uniform.

421
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,011
That's not your uniform.

422
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,514
It's a suit.

423
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,642
That will be my uniform for today.

424
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,062
I have a really important match today.

425
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,111
Let's go.

426
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,827
THIS IS ANNOYING
THIS IS ANNOYING

427
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,376
I'm sorry.

428
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,878
Is that woman

429
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,964
Si-an's visual director?

430
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,549
Oh, do you mean Ms. Choi?

431
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,386
Yes. She'll be directing Mr. Cha's
new album and the exhibition.

432
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,847
This is annoying.

433
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,098
SHE'S COMPETENT AND EVEN PRETTY

434
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,017
Why? Does she bother you?

435
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,768
Of course she does.

436
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,438
My Si-an is with a pretty woman.

437
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,775
She is competent.
Why does she have to be pretty, too?

438
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,445
If it were up to me,
I'd split them up immediately.

439
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,905
Split who up?

440
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,449
-Choi--
-Choi Da-in.

441
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,538
Director Gold, are you going home?

442
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,460
Am I the only one going home?

443
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,963
Ms. Yu.

444
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,840
Yu-seop, Hyo-jin.

445
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,343
Is there work that you must finish today?

446
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,263
About Mr. Ahn's work...

447
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,933
The insurance...

448
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,190
I can just do it tomorrow.

449
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,151
There's no need to do it today.

450
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,074
Then shall we all call it a day?

451
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,284
Good job today, everyone.

452
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,454
Good job.

453
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,092
What? Do I look too pretty?

454
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,262
I was thinking about what to eat today.

455
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,473
I'm not hungry.

456
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,475
-I doubt that.
-I mean it.

457
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,352
We're going on a drive today.

458
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,354
That sounds good. Where to?

459
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,857
I'll take you to my car. Follow me.

460
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,575
You have such a nice and big car.

461
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,744
It's a convertible. Get in.

462
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,997
Here.

463
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,667
-It's okay.
-Why?

464
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,211
Do you know how hard it is
to write a tour guide speech?

465
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,172
Think of it as a courtesy to
the writer, and listen to it.

466
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,228
I'm not listening to this.

467
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,438
Why?

468
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,860
Come to think of it,
you grew up and lived in this city.

469
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,320
You're a local
who's really familiar with this place.

470
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,322
Why would I have to listen to this?

471
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,116
You should do it instead.

472
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,284
Me?

473
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,994
Okay, then.

474
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,788
-What is that?
-A building?

475
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,406
Part two of Sung Duk-mi's
Seoul Night View Tour.

476
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,908
What was part one?

477
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,118
I already did it. Sung Duk-mi's Penthouse.

478
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,334
I wanted to show you
the night view of Seoul,

479
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,086
but as you know,
I don't have a driver's license.

480
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,341
I like the night view. It's beautiful.

481
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,842
I know, right?

482
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,136
And the woman sitting next to me

483
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,013
has no driver's license.

484
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,432
Why didn't you get a license?

485
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,393
-Because I was scared.
-Scared?

486
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,563
Did you give up after failing
the driving test several times?

487
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,815
Do you want to ride a car that I drive?

488
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,443
I'll go register for the test
right now, then.

489
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,112
No?

490
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,447
I'll drive.

491
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,430
Be careful. It's hot.

492
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,349
Aren't you going to go home?

493
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,059
My mom's helping me out.

494
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,312
She offered to babysit Geon-u,
so I'm going to take my time.

495
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,107
Good luck.

496
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,984
Thanks.

497
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,830

00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,709
THE ROAD TO SI-AN CHAT ROOM

500
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,295
-There it is!
-It's airing!

501
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,130
The Chaser K.

502
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,882
But what's wrong with the title?

503
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,844
Hey, wait. The Twisted Love of Fanatics?

504
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,179
That wasn't the original title.

505
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,642
I'm pretty sure it was
Super Fangirl of the 21st Century.

506
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,519
The title sounds
like it's criticizing fangirls.

507
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,438
What was the name of the producer again?

508
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,358
-It was Kang Min or something.
-Kang Min or something?

509
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,651
You remember his face, right?

510
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,361
-Yes, of course.
-Wait.

511
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,156
I think we totally got fooled.

512
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,907
-You're right.
-Seriously?

513
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,827
-What the...
-That jerk fooled us.

514
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,080
What's this?

515
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,373
So what's the story?

516
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,377
It's just a story
on those trying very hard in life.

517
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,963
I thought you had a story to cover.

518
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,382
Yes, it happened to be
just around the corner.

Duk-mi, are you okay now?

521
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,020
I heard about how you were harassed
by Cha Si-an's fans.

Hey, honey.

525
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,461
Where are you right now?

526
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,463
Honey.

527
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,174
Let's just think about Geon-u.

528
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,634
Wherever you are right now,

529
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,220
there will be a river nearby.

530
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,471
A river?

531
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,974
The river you'll soon be crossing.

532
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,560
But I don't want to cross a river.

533
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,853
Seung-min.

534
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,106
Get over here right now.

535
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,191
Right now!

536
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,575
My gosh.

537
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,586
Seon-ju, calm down and hear me out first.

538
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,714
They promised to transfer me
to a variety show if I did this.

539
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,800
So I had no choice but to do it.

540
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,636
You also wanted me
to work on variety shows.

541
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,972
I told you to work on variety shows,
not sell out your own wife.

542
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,015
What are you talking about?
I didn't sell you out.

543
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,767
-Ju-hyeok.
-Yes?

544
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,477
-Lock the doors.
-Seon-ju.

545
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,562
Ms. Lee.

546
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm going to become a widow today.

547
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,734
Get over here!

548
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,071
-Stop her!
-Get out of my way!

549
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,950
Get over here!

550
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,536
Gosh, no.

551
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,831
Just take this bag back and leave!

552
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,250
Seon-ju, I'm sorry.

553
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,546
It must've been quite windy.

554
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,256
-You have an eyelash here.
-What?

555
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,967
Right there. It's a little to the side.

556
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,177
-Right next to your eye.
-Here?

557
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,344
Yes.

558
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,722
No, not there. I'll do it for you.

559
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,145
Don't do that.

560
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,237
Okay, I'll stop.

561
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,222
Let's go on a river cruise next time.

562
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,684
Sure, let's do everything we can in Seoul.

563
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,604
Just a second.

564
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,275
Duk-mi, did you get off work?

565
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,693
When are you planning to come home?

566
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,529
Who is it?

567
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,614
It's Eun-gi. He wants to know
if I got off work.

568
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,035
You and Mr. Nam

569
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,704
must be really close.

570
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,039
Close?

571
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,627
Why are you laughing?

572
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,631
I never really thought
of our relationship that way.

573
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,007
You're that close?

574
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,886
Do you remember Editor Nam,
the woman who interviewed you?

575
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,596
She's Eun-gi's mother.

576
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,848
She and my mom first met
at an OB-GYN clinic.

577
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,809
But Editor Nam had something
personal going on,

578
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,729
so my mom started raising me
and Eun-gi like twins.

579
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,983
He's like family to me.

580
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,696
Do you think Mr. Nam

581
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,699
also thinks that way?

582
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,620
He might think differently.

583
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,456
He might have feelings for you.

584
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,006
A lot of people told me that
ever since we were students.

585
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,134
We went to a co-ed school.

586
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,013
Every time anyone said that,
Eun-gi and I got into a huge fight.

587
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,349
But we're really like siblings.

588
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,018
No, more like brothers.

589
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,103
Or maybe sisters.

590
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,522
He might feel differently
from how he did when he was young.

591
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,817
There are times when people
take a while to realize their feelings.

592
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,613
Director Gold.

593
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,909
By any chance, are you doubting
my relationship with Eun-gi?

594
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,163
I don't doubt you.

595
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:49,627
I'm saying that he's always next to you,
so you might not know.

596
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,005
What about you?

597
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,804
I'm talking about Ms. Choi.
You two are really close.

598
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,515
When it comes to Da-in,

599
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,228
I can't say we're close,
but I do like her.

600
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,022
What?

601
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,149
I like her competence as an artist,

602
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,693
and I like her works.

603
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,571
And Da-in trusts me as a director

604
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,865
and an artist.

605
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,702
Do you think Ms. Choi feels the same way?

606
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,334
That might not be the case.

607
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,318
Duk-mi.

608
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,446
As you already know,

609
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,075
my lifetime goal was to win
a gold medal in the Olympics.

610
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,953
But now, my goal

611
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,498
is you.

612
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,710
I want to buy you delicious stuff,

613
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,964
make you laugh, make you happy,

614
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,426
protect you, and take you home every day.

615
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,055
I may have retired
as an Olympic silver medalist,

616
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,186
but I won't ever retire
when it comes to fighting for you.

617
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,734
I like you, Duk-mi.

618
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,783
I can do this.

619
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,506
Go home safely.

620
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,512
Director Gold?

621
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,391
You know I don't like letting go
of someone's hand.

622
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,648
Why don't you just take me inside as well?

623
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,569
How about just my hand, then?

624
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,822
Just your hand?

625
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,869
You're saying something really scary
with a smile.

626
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,871
Goodnight, then.

627
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,373
Goodnight.

628
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,953
Ms. Sung.

629
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,548
What...

630
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,866
Hold still.

631
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,465
What's this?

632
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,926
I was going to give it to you that night,

633
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,804
but you dumped me.

634
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,182
Your actions upset me quite a lot.

635
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,392
Did I mention that?

636
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,519
I didn't dump you.

637
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,439
You know that.

638
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,028
It's pretty.

639
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:30,152
FIRST DATE WITH LION

640
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,799
Duk-mi.

641
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,093
Duk-mi!

642
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:57,971
Gosh, Eun-gi.

643
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,439
I like you.

644
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,775
I like you, Duk-mi.

645
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,443
I...

646
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,238
I'm sorry.
I read your text but didn't reply.

647
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,533
I prepared these for you,
so please take what you need.

648
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,701
Here you go.

649
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,582
Are you mad?

650
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,878
Then what's with that face?
Smile, you jerk.

651
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,923
-Smile! Right now!
-I'm not angry.

652
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:34,966
Right?

653
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,927
But what's with the suit?

654
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,598
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

655
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,018
When we were born,

656
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,607
if my mom hadn't tried
to abandon me at the hospital...

657
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,235
You knew? Since when?

658
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,694
When I joined the national team.

659
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,905
Editor Nam got drunk
and spilled everything.

660
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,450
I thought she only did that with me.

661
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,038
Anyway, I doubt she really meant it.

662
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:09,501
That's why Mom was able to catch her.

663
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,336
If Editor Nam were serious
about running away,

664
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,713
she wouldn't have
blindly trusted a stranger.

665
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,717
I'm sure she was just terrified.

666
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,596
I understand since she was
younger than we are now.

667
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,808
Editor Nam told me

668
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,102
to be good.

669
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,568
I should be good to your mom,
your dad, and you, too.

670
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,697
You're my family.

671
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,615
Of course we are.

672
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,450
-But Duk-mi.
-Yes?

673
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,204
I...

674
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,707
You see...

675
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,003
-I'd like to--
-Seon-ju?

676
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,672
-Seon-ju?
-What are you doing here so late?

677
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,009
Something happened, didn't it?

678
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,221
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

679
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,639
I'm going back.

680
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,808
-To where?
-To being single again.

681
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,626
EX-HUSBAND

682
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,883
Seon-ju.

683
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,052
The show was going to be made
one way or another.

684
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,971
Isn't it better for it to have been
directed by him...

685
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,434
Forget I said anything. Drink up.

686
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,897
-Duk-mi.
-Yes?

687
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,441
Don't you ever get married.

688
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,319
No, don't even bother dating.

689
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,820
Just stay single.

690
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,156
You're never any help, are you?

691
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,700
Jerk.

692
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,913
MR. KANG

693
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,623
If it's Seung-min, don't answer.

694
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,126
-He'll be worried, so--
-I'll kill myself if you do.

695
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,419
I'll kill myself!

696
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,589
-I'm leaving.
-No, wait.

697
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,091
Stay here.

698
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,011
Don't answer him.

699
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,888
Let's turn off all our phones.

700
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:30,016
I can't believe that jerk!

701
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,477
Let him worry about you all night.

702
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,647
How's that?

703
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,576
Seon-ju, drink up. I'm just as upset, too.

704
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,496
-Let's get wasted.
-Sure thing.

705
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,374
We have lots of time to drink.

706
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,959
You wench.

707
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,901
I can't get it out of my head.

708
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,790
SUNG DUK-MI

709
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,759
What?

710
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,596
Why?

711
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,316
It's seven o'clock.

712
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,319
It's the perfect time
to go see my girlfriend.

713
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,372
-Mr. Kim.
-Where are you going today?

714
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,000
-Sangam-dong.
-Why don't you go to work a bit late?

715
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,877
You should get some rest on closing days.

716
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,171
Mr. Kim, did you already forget?

717
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,507
My real job is fangirling.

718
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,426
-Here.
-I'll see you later.

719
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,030
Oh, my. Director Eom.

720
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,829
Hey!

721
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,877
Mom.

722
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,273
Duk-mi, where are you going?

723
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,900
How could you get drunk like that, too?

724
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,947
It's been a long time since I drank.

725
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,117
-Where are you going?
-Me?

726
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,494
To shoot pictures of Si-an
on his way to work.

727
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,331
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

728
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,003
You like fangirling more than breakfast?

729
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,797
This is my breakfast.

730
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,633
Goodness. Will this be enough?

731
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,010
The camera is heavy, too.

732
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,803
This will be enough. I'm full.

733
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,848
Wake Seon-ju up before you go. See you.

734
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,109
Wait for me.

735
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,508
Do you want to continue fangirling
after what happened to Seon-ju?

736
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,093
At times like this, I have to
continue fangirling consistently

737
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,179
so Seon-ju forgives her husband.

738
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,348
How logical.

739
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,225
You must've studied hard
when you were a kid.

740
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,894
Don't you remember?
I solved all your questions for you.

741
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,021
-You did.
-Let's go.

742
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,509
Hey. Did something
really happen yesterday?

743
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,719
-What's wrong?
-It's Lion.

744
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,114
Ms. Sung.

745
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,494
Director Gold.

746
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,788
Did you come without even making plans?

747
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,915
Today is...

748
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,543
Come back next time.

749
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,350
I want to speak with Duk-mi.

750
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,694
Duk-mi

751
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,572
didn't wash her face.

752
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,200
I don't think she feels comfortable
seeing you right now.

753
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,003
I said I want to speak with Duk-mi.

754
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,802
Duk-mi says she doesn't want
to speak with you.

755
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:43,973
Duk-mi

756
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,392
is my girlfriend.

757
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,903
So this is between her and me.

758
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,947
It's none of your business.

759
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,994
Why isn't it my business?

760
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,915
She's the woman I like.

761
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:20,093
Duk-mi doesn't want herself
to be seen right now.

762
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,054
By you, Director Gold.

763
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,642
If you really care for Duk-mi,

764
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,269
please leave for now.

765
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,999
Come out, Ms. Sung.

766
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,139
It's okay.

767
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,978
The Road to Si-an.

768
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,498
Why did you bring me to your place
to fight?

769
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,957
Is it a home game or what?

770
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,751
Ryan? Ms. Sung?

771
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,085
Why didn't you tell me?

772
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,379
Because she doesn't know
how you feel about her.

773
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,633
Did Mr. Nam sleep at your place
last night?

774
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,969
-And as for Eun-gi--
-He likes you.

775
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,139
Right now, you're not family nor a friend
to me. You're a woman.

776
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,600
No matter how long it takes, I can wait.

777
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,393
Teach me too.

778
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,021
So I want to be your fanboy too.

779
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,524
