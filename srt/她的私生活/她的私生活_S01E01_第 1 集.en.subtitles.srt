1
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,393
All children are artists.

2
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,240
However,

3
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,287
the problem is how they can remain
as artists when they're grown up.

4
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,227
Ms. Sung, we have a situation!

5
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,188
What is it?

6
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,482
The plane got delayed,
so it just got handed over to customs.

7
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,528
-When is it expected to arrive?
-At seven.

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,656
It's a nine-hour delay.
Should we postpone the exhibition?

9
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,865
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,910
We must hold the exhibition tomorrow
at 10 a.m. no matter what.

11
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,371
-Thank you.
-Bye.

12
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,295
The final guests have left.

13
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,630
Good job.

14
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,322
-Check if the quantities match.
-Okay.

15
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,824
Shall we begin then?

16
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,701
Please back up slowly.

17
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,667
Item number KDC-5.

18
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,420
-Be extra careful with that. Watch out.
-Yes, ma'am.

19
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,339
-Yu-seop. Let's move.
-Let's move out.

20
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,182
-Yu-seop, organize them in order.
-Okay.

21
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,961
CHOI EUN-HYE
I LOVE, 18-9

22
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,506
Setting up an exhibition
in one day was actually possible.

23
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,552
Okay, move it exactly 2cm
to the left, please!

24
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,221
Okay, good!

25
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,891
CHOI EUN-HYE'S TRAVELING EXHIBITION

26
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,060
Perfect, tie it up!

27
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,103
ARTIST CHOI EUN-HYE'S POSTERS ON SALE

28
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,499
-We'll begin now.
-Okay.

29
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,640
Cheum Museum is honored to open

30
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,518
Artist Choi Eun-hye's exhibition today.

31
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,772
Let me introduce the star
of today's exhibition, Choi Eun-hye.

32
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,903
Thank you.

33
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,780
First of all,

34
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,699
I'd like to thank someone

35
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,618
who worked hard behind the scene
for this occasion.

36
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,250
Director Eom So-hye.

37
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,254
I'd like to sincerely thank Director Eom.

38
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,970
Good morning.

39
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,139
I'm the director of Cheum Museum,

40
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,516
Eom So-hye.

41
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,560
One day, my husband
brought home a painting.

42
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,812
-She did nothing.
-And he told me that he found

43
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,856
a talented new artist.

44
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
We've been keeping
a close relationship ever since,

45
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,610
and that's how we were able

46
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,780
to exhibit her paintings
at Cheum Museum today. Thank you.

47
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,716
-What do you need to send?
-Me.

48
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,551
Can you take me here in 15 minutes?

49
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,219
Gosh, it's going to be rush hour soon.

50
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,429
I'll pay you four times more.

51
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
Ten minutes will do.

52
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,436
Let's go.

53
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,482
Where is she going in such a hurry?

54
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,734
She's such a workaholic.

55
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,944
Does she ever have fun?

56
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,129
I can't wait.

57
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,553
When will they come?

58
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,347
-They're coming!
-They're here!

59
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,765
SI-AN'S GIRL, JU-I
SI-AN IS MY SPRING

60
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,768
Over here!

61
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,190
-One, two, three. Hi, we're White Ocean.
-Hi, we're White Ocean.

62
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,568
Look over here!

63
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,069
Si-an!

64
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,654
Can you please look here as well?

65
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,322
Over here, please.

66
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,117
-Please take this.
-Si-an, here!

67
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,618
You're so handsome!

68
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,203
Si-an!

69
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,663
My Si-an!

70
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,339
SI-AN

71
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,632
-Snapshot!
-Snapshot!

72
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,891
-White Ocean!
-White Ocean!

73
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,480
-Perfect!
-Perfect!

74
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,567
-Perfect!
-Perfect!

75
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,038
3 APRIL, 2019
SHOWCASE "SNAPSHOT"

76
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,957
It's perfect.

77
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,172
Let's see how many likes I got.

78
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,889
I got 1,578 likes? Not bad.

79
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,144
By the way, Si-an. Are you tired?

80
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,938
Did someone bother you?

81
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,399
Should I scold that person for you?

82
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,401
SI-AN GOING TO WORK

83
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,694
He's so cute.

84
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,907
All I can do is tell you that I like you.

85
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,617
There's nothing else I can do for you.

86
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,288
I should at least get him something nice
for his birthday.

87
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,256
-What's this?
-Hashtag, Si-an's birthday gift.

88
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,425
Hashtag, limited edition.
Hashtag, luxury brand.

89
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,427
I was going to get him this.

90
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,804
How did Sindy get this?

91
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,476
What am I supposed to get now?

92
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,778
My parents are very much interested
in art.

93
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,740
So I was surrounded by art
ever since I was young.

94
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,450
After I started to earn my own living,

95
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,369
I started buying artworks of my own taste.

96
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,871
And here's my collection.

97
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,998
Oh, here it is.

98
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,917
It was painted by Lee Sol,
an artist that I only know by name.

99
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,628
I fell in love with this at first sight.

100
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,464
I only have a piece from a series.

101
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,132
Isn't it so beautiful?

102
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,176
I SEE A LOT OF ART WORKS IN YOUR HOUSE

103
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,178
Yes, this is what I'm talking about.

104
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,056
This is the kind of face he makes
when he's in a really good mood.

105
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,224
How cute. He's so cute.

106
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,270
What's this painting?

107
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,648
I really want to buy it for him.

108
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,442
I'm going to get this
for his birthday this year.

109
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,569
I'll get it for you.

110
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,930
Stendhal syndrome.

111
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,309
When exposed to an incredible work of art,

112
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,478
he or she may experience...

113
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,236
He or she may experience a rush
of psychological symptoms

114
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,572
including shock or schizophrenia.
You little...

115
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,490
Stop it!

116
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,784
Do you know how much this costs?

117
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,828
Was it 89.99 dollars?

118
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,747
And the cost price is probably
about 12 dollars.

119
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,500
Did you buy that
because you really liked it? Or,

120
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,544
did you buy it because it was cheap?

121
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,462
I bought it because I liked it.
Is there a problem?

122
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,635
Okay, then.

123
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,513
Let me get back to where I was.

124
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,475
After seeing a certain painting,
not only could you not draw,

125
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,019
but you couldn't even hold a brush.

126
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,856
And that's why I diagnosed you
with the Stendhal syndrome.

127
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,025
I tried psychological consulting,
drug treatment,

128
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,568
and hypnosis for three whole years.

129
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,612
But there was no improvement

130
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,363
thanks to my incompetent doctor.

131
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,573
That I admit,

132
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,533
so please stop coming to me, okay?

133
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,160
I give up. All right?

134
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,205
-What now?
-You may give up on me,

135
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,916
but I won't give up on you.

136
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,752
I can't let you remain
as an incompetent doctor.

137
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,837
You can do it.

138
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,422
Let's do this.

139
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,762
So did you look into the paintings?

140
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,766
Have you heard
of the K-pop star Cha Si-an?

141
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,934
A member of the White Ocean?

142
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,895
Yes, my nieces love him.

143
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,605
He has one.

144
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,273
Really?

145
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,235
For three years, you couldn't even
find out about the artist,

146
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,863
but a K-pop singer had one?

147
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,783
Maybe it's by a famous artist.

148
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,701
Anyway,

149
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,620
this is good news.

150
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,246
Go ask him to show you the painting.

151
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,042
-Me?
-Yes.

152
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
You.

153
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,756
Who else, then?

154
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,716
The reason why you can't paint

155
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,803
is in that painting,
so coming to me is useless.

156
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,979
This is my last advice as your doctor.

157
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,563
Stop pestering me

158
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,692
and find that painting
or the artist behind it, Ryan.

159
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
Don't pronounce that with an L.

160
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,615
It's Ryan.

161
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,210
ARTWORK BY KIM MIN-HYEOK

162
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,549
Did you go somewhere
after the VIP screening event?

163
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,593
I looked for you, but you were not around.

164
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,058
There is a young boy I sponsor.

165
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,978
I left early to attend
a talent show of his.

166
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,774
You go to see the kid's talent show?

167
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,111
What else do you do?

168
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,032
Well, I celebrate his birthdays

169
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,493
and wish him luck when he has an exam.

170
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,665
WHITE OCEAN

171
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,715
So that's why you're interested

172
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,093
in finding talented rookie artists.

173
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,639
Will they bring in people though?

174
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,018
Selling tickets is important,
but we should also find artists

175
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,395
-with potential.
-Ms. Sung.

176
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,774
I like well-known artists
better than those with potential.

177
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,734
The more acclaimed, the better.

178
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,236
Stop fussing over useless artists

179
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,531
and buy all the art by Ivanoff
for the museum.

180
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,827
My arm's starting to ache.

181
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,454
Right, I should take that.

182
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,501
Here. Let me show you.

183
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,046
Look. You should lower it down straight.

184
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,756
You don't want it to shift.

185
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,801
Lower it down like this and press.

186
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:16,887
Yes.

187
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,724
Studying abroad sure has its perks.

188
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,103
Why on earth
would you bring that up right now?

189
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,356
-Are you making fun of me?
-No, of course not.

190
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,652
I bet she turned you down.

191
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm going to do it someday.

192
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,239
What's that?

193
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,449
This?

194
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,077
An acclaimed artist.

195
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,829
She wants me to buy the art at an auction.

196
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,789
I wish you luck.

197
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,793
FIRST BIRTHDAY

198
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,057
A business trip?

199
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,768
You said things will slow down
once the exhibition begins.

200
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,311
There's an auction I must attend.

201
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,568
Don't tell me

202
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,405
you're using that as an excuse
to chase that singer.

203
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,075
What are you talking about?

204
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm too busy for that.

205
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,622
By the way,
the kimchi stew is to die for today.

206
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,376
You had better not get caught fangirling.

207
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,171
If you do, I'll grab you and that boy

208
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,882
and shave both of your hair off.

209
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,843
-He didn't do anything wrong.
-Of course, he did!

210
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,096
You broke your arm while following
that singer you like in your senior year.

211
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,515
If you had gotten into college then,

212
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,518
we would've been able to send you
to study abroad before we went broke.

213
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,312
You're not an artist today

214
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,480
because of that silly fangirling.

215
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,152
But who made me this way?

216
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,614
Seriously? Who on earth are you blaming?

217
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,326
It's not like I put you in a class
that taught Fangirling 101?

218
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,328
You see, Mom,

219
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,498
fangirls and fanboys are born,
not trained.

220
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,505
I'm home.

221
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,806
I'm home.

222
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,482
I'm home.

223
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,663
Fanatics raise fanatics, not muggles.

224
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,539
-What's that?
-Muggles are

225
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,709
non-wizards from Harry Potter.
Among fanatics, they're known

226
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,378
as non-fanatics.

227
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,839
What I mean is that I'm a fanatic
because you and Dad are.

228
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,760
You're obsessing right now.

229
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,805
This isn't the same. I'm only knitting.

230
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,390
Just look.

231
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,060
This, this, and this.

232
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,189
Eun-gi and I only wore knitted clothes
while growing up.

233
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,192
How is this just knitting?
This is what being a fanatic looks like.

234
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,861
Also, Dad.

235
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,321
Dad?

236
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,792
You have your knitting
while he has his rocks.

237
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,669
I don't need a DNA test.

238
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,379
I am your daughter for sure.

239
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,673
You're as inanimate as it is.

240
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,509
Must you always bring home rocks
that are just like you?

241
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,720
Throw them out already!

242
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,940
I'll get going then.

243
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,858
Duk-mi,

244
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,235
take these side dishes with you.

245
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,242
These aren't side dishes.

246
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,660
You packed Dad's rocks.

247
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,787
That's rich considering how much you eat.

248
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,622
Come on. I'll carry these for you.

249
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,750
Actually, it's all right.

250
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,126
You said they're heavy.

251
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,336
I'll carry them for you.

252
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,547
I'm worried that the trip back alone
will be dangerous for you.

253
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,466
I'll be fine.

254
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,302
-Eun-gi?
-He's asleep.

255
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,387
Eun-gi, you jerk!

256
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,270
Eun-gi, can you carry these home for me?

257
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,438
I'm busy,

258
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,774
harvesting apples.

259
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,234
-I'll give you 3,000 won.
-My apples will rot.

260
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,444
Then, 4,000 won.

261
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,655
Address me as your big brother then.

262
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,660
My big brother.

263
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,247
Make it 5,000 won.

264
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,583
Bye, Mom.

265
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,172
Don't skip your meals.
You seem gaunt as it is.

266
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,256
I'll be right back.

267
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,529
You moved out to keep fangirling?

268
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,697
Mom will kill you if she finds out.

269
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,243
I'm her daughter, so I doubt it.

270
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,210
November 23, 2005, 2:13 a.m.

271
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,587
Have you already forgotten?

272
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,228
No, please.

273
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,565
No, you can't. Not the hair.

274
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,608
I need it to look pretty.

275
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,404
Not my hair.

276
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,618
Hey.

277
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,419
I changed the combination.

278
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,759
How did you know that?

279
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,678
It's obvious.

280
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,096
It either

281
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,599
his birthday, 970412, or 140523,

282
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,975
the day he debuted.

283
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,439
Don't you dare tell Mom though.

284
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,399
I'll kill you if you do, got it?

285
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,403
This is why it's useless to have kids.

286
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,572
How can you do this to Mom?

287
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,618
-What's wrong?
-My gosh.

288
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,125
Hey!

289
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,338
Don't touch him!

290
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,798
Get away from him!

291
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,134
You murderer.

292
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,479
I'm the lunatic
for letting an idiot like him

293
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,439
into a sacred place like this.

294
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,901
You can't even distinguish
between a person and a paper figure.

295
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,527
How could you even play judo?

296
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,871
-Sungduk.
-What?

297
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,456
-I'm going.
-Go.

298
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,791
He looks like Si-an.

299
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,312
It was made in 1987.

300
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,730
He's Korean.

301
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,443
Delicate lines
and coherent facial features.

302
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,570
The perfect ratio is its characteristic.

303
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:19,739
Wait.

304
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,117
I'm not sure what you mean.

305
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,910
The title of the art piece

306
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,121
is Ryan Gold.

307
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,545
Don't tell me you're talking
about yourself.

308
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,921
Do you want it?

309
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,131
What?

310
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,466
No.

311
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,640
I thought you wanted it

312
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,809
since you stared at me so much.

313
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,061
Goodness.

314
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,898
What a lunatic.

315
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,622
It was painted by Lee Sol,
an artist that I only know by name.

316
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,708
I fell in love with this at first sight.

317
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,626
My goodness.

318
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,547
How much money is left?

319
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,715
SI-AN'S BIRTHDAY SUPPORT FUND

320
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,888
30,000,000 WON IS 27,000 DOLLARS

321
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,681
DUK-MI, TAKE ME

322
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,564
I'll take you home by all means.

323
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,693
To all the members who've pitched in
for Si-an's fan club,

324
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,988
I'll go all in
and use all the birthday funds for this!

325
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,475
SI-AN'S BIRTHDAY SUPPORT FUND
$27,000

326
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,061
IF I USE MY MONEY FOR THE ADDITIONAL COST
I CAN PURCHASE IT

327
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,947
EXCHANGE RATE
29,000 DOLLARS

328
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,121
Please.

329
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,707
30,000 DOLLARS

330
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,409
Hey, mister!

331
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,833
Mister, wait.

332
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,463
Wait!

333
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,341
Excuse me, mister.

334
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,931
That artwork you just bid for,

335
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,599
please yield it to me.

336
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,142
Is it your first time at an auction?

337
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,480
I know this type of suggestion
may put you in an awkward situation,

338
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,816
but if you think about it,
it's for your sake.

339
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,818
-Is that so?
-Yes.

340
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,364
You must've seen me
winning Ivanoff's work,

341
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,616
and thought I was an expert
with great taste.

342
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,118
I guess you've followed me
to bid for the next item.

343
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,330
But actually, Lee Sol's work
has not been verified yet

344
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,541
in terms of popularity or artistic value.

345
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,462
I'm afraid the price you bid for
is too high compared to its value.

346
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,423
I also participated in this bid
as per my client's request.

347
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,050
So if you yield it to me--

348
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,052
How much do you know about Ivanoff

349
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,429
whose painting you just bought?

350
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,306
Besides its price.

351
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,937
I work in the art industry.

352
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,691
-Ivanoff is--
-His hands started tremble severely

353
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,109
since two years ago due to alcoholism.

354
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,529
You bought a low-quality drawing
by a painter who has lost his touch,

355
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,322
just by believing in his reputation.

356
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,413
It's easy to determine the price
with just reputation.

357
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,874
But recognizing the true value
of an art piece

358
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,459
is not something anyone can do.

359
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,857
If it weren't for that lunatic...

360
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,070
Why did I hesitate?
Love doesn't have a budget.

361
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,698
This is so annoying.

362
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,096
I can't believe this!

363
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,516
Director Eom.

364
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,393
-Are you Ms. Sung Duk-mi?
-Yes.

365
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,937
We're from Seoul District
Prosecutors' Office. Come with us.

366
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,105
Let's go.

367
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,232
This is breaking news.
Director Eom So-hye,

368
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,318
the wife of Chairman Kim Mu-san
of TK Group

369
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,654
who was arrested on charges
of malpractice and embezzlement,

370
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,824
has been suspected of being involved
in creating slush funds.

371
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,077
The special unit
of Seoul District Prosecutors' Office

372
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,080
carried out a search and seizure
on Cheum Museum this morning,

373
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,831
which is an affiliate of TK Group.

374
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,043
The prosecution was investigating
Chairman Kim

375
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,504
on charges of malpractice
and embezzlement,

376
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,672
and found out
that Director Eom So-hye of Cheum Museum

377
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,675
was deeply involved
in the establishment of the slush funds.

378
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,761
She has been arrested without warrant.

379
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,555
The prosecution has been investigating
this case since 2014.

380
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,643
A slush fund? No.

381
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,689
I've never heard of any of this.

382
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,691
I really don't know anything.

383
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,318
Are you seriously going to be like this?

384
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,466
My gosh, you startled me!

385
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,470
-You're home.
-Hey.

386
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,891
Cheers.

387
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,903
Are you okay?

388
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,905
Of course.

389
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,662
Seon-ju.

390
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,290
Here you go again.

391
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,127
I'm not going anywhere.

392
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:20,970
Seon-ju.

393
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,431
Do you know

394
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,768
what I enjoy the most
about working at the museum?

395
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,772
Getting paid?

396
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,195
Hanging artworks

397
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,200
in the exhibition room.

398
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,536
Once I do that,

399
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,372
people come to the exhibition room

400
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,919
and feel moved by looking
at the artwork I hung up on the wall.

401
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,589
I...

402
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,134
really love doing that.

403
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,931
How can someone love their work so much?

404
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,770
You work way too hard.
That's your problem.

405
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,068
But Seon-ju,

406
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,616
apparently, the artworks
I've been hanging on the wall

407
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,913
were actually being used
to build a slush fund

408
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,750
instead of being used
to touch people's hearts.

409
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,840
I worked so hard.

410
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,095
I worked so hard like a fool.

411
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,766
You didn't know anything.

412
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,726
You were not aware of it.

413
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,191
But do you know

414
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,819
what angers me the most?

415
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,031
What if

416
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,368
I knew everything?

417
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,164
If I already knew about everything,

418
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,253
would I have refused to do my job?

419
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,590
Would I have been able to do that?

420
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,219
Duk-mi.

421
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,016
Could I have said no?

422
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,358
Stop crying. Wipe your tears.

423
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,114
Those jerks.

424
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,535
I really have no idea
what I've been doing until now.

425
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,167
It's not your fault.

426
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,048
You're making me cry as well.

427
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,708
Hello?

428
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,013
Ms. Lee, is your best friend
on a blind date?

429
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,811
First of all,
my friend doesn't meet guys in real life.

430
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,771
The only guy she dates
is on her phone screen.

431
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,068
And secondly, why would she dare
go on a blind date at my coffee shop?

432
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,694
Any other human being can do that,

433
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,030
but not my friend.

434
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,657
But you're married with a kid.

435
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,367
I only got married because I got pregnant.

436
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,251
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT LEE SANG-HYEON

437
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,380
You want to hire me as the team manager
of GN Group's Brand Marketing Team?

438
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,341
Yes, the chairman's wife recommended you.

439
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,260
She's a good friend of Director Eom,

440
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,886
so she frequently visited Cheum Museum.

441
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,722
The wife of GN Group's chairman?

442
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,938
You wench!

443
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,566
-Ma'am.
-Let me go!

444
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,900
I said, let go!

445
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,194
I'm sorry!

446
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,420
She thinks highly of your competence.

447
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,382
What would my main job be
in the Brand Marketing Team?

448
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,177
It won't be much different
from what you have been doing.

449
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,179
You'll be doing joint projects
with art institutions

450
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,307
and social contribution projects
with cultural foundations.

451
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,142
I see.

452
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,853
The job does sound very meaningful.

453
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,647
Just for your information,
this is the motto of our company,

454
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,274
"Let's spend the evening outside of work."

455
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,525
You'll have flexible work hours,

456
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,486
so once you work 40 hours a week
at the office,

457
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,987
you're free to do whatever.

458
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,908
Does this mean I'll get enough time
to be a true fangirl?

459
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,134
Is this crisis going to turn
into an opportunity?

460
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,846
Ju-hyeok.

461
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,849
You can break whatever you want,
but I still won't go bankrupt.

462
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,351
My dad owns the building.

463
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,994
Director Eom,
I have something to tell you.

464
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,996
And what is that?

465
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,628
-I've decided to quit.
-Ms. Sung.

466
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,756
How long have you worked for me?

467
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,717
During the two months
after you opened the museum,

468
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,053
you fired about 12 curators.

469
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,598
Then you put me in charge
because no one applied for the job.

470
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,267
So it's been five years now.

471
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,936
-Has it been that long already?
-Yes.

472
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,189
You really worked very hard.

473
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,607
Yes.

474
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,360
-That's why I'm here to tell you--
-Yes, I know.

475
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,154
The reason our museum was able
to exist until now

476
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,407
is all thanks to you, Ms. Sung.

477
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,910
Take a look.

478
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,289
You decided the layout and caption
for all the artworks.

479
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,624
On top of that, you also painted the walls

480
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,459
and installed all the lights.

481
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,379
You were involved in every little detail.

482
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,342
To be honest, I started this museum
because I was sick of hearing my husband

483
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,261
telling me that he's the breadwinner.

484
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,305
So what would I have known?

485
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,141
If it weren't for you,

486
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,935
Cheum Museum would have had
to shut down a long time ago.

487
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,230
-To be honest--
-To be honest,

488
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,107
I'm going to resign.

489
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,192
What? You're going to resign?

490
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,112
My husband's going to jail.

491
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,699
And the reason I can easily resign is

492
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,244
because I trust
that you'll take good care of the museum.

493
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,956
If not, I would have just shut it down.

494
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,376
Ms. Sung.

495
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,131
Who do you think
is the most suitable to become

496
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,799
the director of Cheum Museum?

497
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:03,098
Someone who loves Cheum Museum
as much as I do.

498
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,269
Someone who has been here
ever since the beginning.

499
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,896
Who is that?

500
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,066
Well, that's...

501
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,740
That's

502
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,327
the kind of person
I think should be the director.

503
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,455
Do you understand what I mean?

504
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,539
Darlings.

505
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,458
This will be our next exhibition.

506
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,171
SI-AN, THE GREAT BEAUTY

507
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,142
DIRECTOR SUNG DUK-MI

508
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,060
Team Manager Sung Duk-mi?

509
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,729
Actually, it's Director Sung Duk-mi now.

510
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,190
Just take the other job.

511
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,984
It'll be two years tops anyway.

512
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,863
Do you know what search word is related
to Cheum Museum?

513
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,656
Slush fund.

514
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,910
For the past five years,

515
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,538
I worked day and night as its curator.

516
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,873
However, it's slush fund.

517
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,917
I can't give up like this.
I'll bring back its reputation.

518
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,795
They say that our personalities
make our fates.

519
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,339
I guess you're living proof of that.

520
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,676
Besides, we'll get
to see each other every day.

521
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,220
That's true.

522
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,807
So when is Si-an arriving again?

523
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,019
At 8:15 p.m.

524
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,439
I can't believe you're not being paid
for this devotion.

525
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,109
My mask.

526
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,111
Stop wearing that.

527
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,739
You need to get Si-an to recognize
your face. Why would you hide?

528
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,117
I won't be remembered as some generic fan.

529
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,953
Someday, we'll meet as two professionals

530
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,747
and have our fates entwined.

531
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,248
Wickedly entwined.

532
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,168
You just don't have a conscience, do you?
Get going then.

533
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,214
We'll be wickedly entwined.

534
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,346
I want to go with you too.

535
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,018
-A runway spreads out
-A runway spreads out

536
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,770
-A highway opens for me
-A highway opens for me

537
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,146
-I walk along it
-I walk along it

538
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,899
-Click, click, snapshot
-Click, click, snapshot

539
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,947
Let's sit for a while.

540
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,992
Yes, I've seen it. I have it.

541
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,578
No way. Did you guys see this?

542
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,455
It's the preview
of Si-an's departure from New York.

543
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,415
-Who's the fanpage master?
-Sindy.

544
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,459
A fanpage master is someone

545
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,920
who takes photos and videos of celebrities

546
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,296
and posts them online.

547
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,049
She must've followed him to the US
to take the same plane.

548
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,854
She's just an obsessed stalker.

549
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,941
Besides, I bet that Si-an likes
The Road to Si-an than Sindy.

550
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,235
Of course. Si-an wouldn't have found fame

551
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,237
if it weren't for The Road to Si-an.

552
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,906
-Hello, we're White Ocean.
-Hello, we're White Ocean.

553
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,908
Hi, I'm Cha Si-an of the White Ocean.

554
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,618
-He's so awesome.
-I'm so nervous.

555
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,287
Before Si-an debuted,

556
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,747
she posted the videos she recorded
and even added English subtitles.

557
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,792
She even made recipes
in his name go viral.

558
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,837
I wouldn't be mad if Si-an

559
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,463
allowed The Road to Si-an
a one-on-one date.

560
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,840
-Me neither.
-Same here.

561
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:05,799
Same.

562
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:28,780
SI-AN'S VAN

563
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,374
BODYGUARDS IN PLAIN CLOTHES?

564
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,960
NEW YORK, ARRIVAL TIME, 8:15 P.M.

565
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,878
I can almost smell Si-an now.

566
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,215
My love.

567
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,969
-Does anyone see anything?
-Nothing yet.

568
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,793
Seriously? You, get out of the way.

569
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,342
Darn it. Get out of the way!

570
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,394
It's Si-an!

571
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,438
-What?
-Where?

572
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,871
Thank goodness.

573
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,709
Oh my goodness!

574
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,841
Are you all right?

575
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,471
My gosh. Let me help you with that.

576
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,893
What do you think you're doing?

577
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,522
Should I hear that from the person
who sat on me and ripped my jacket?

578
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,650
Still, why would you try
to destroy my camera?

579
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,026
Your camera?

580
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,444
It seems too high-performance

581
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,780
for one needed
to take pictures of that loser.

582
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,156
What did you say?

583
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,077
Did you just call Si-an a loser?

584
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,705
Why are you blaming him
for something I did?

585
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,207
I see you are all about manners.

586
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,543
Then your apology is long overdue.

587
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,215
Well, I'm extremely sorry.

588
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,676
Let me at least see
who's apologizing to me.

589
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,018
No!

590
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,645
No, don't take it off!

591
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,209
Gosh, he's so pretty.

592
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,712
Only I was able to land this shot.

593
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,797
-It's a one-of-a-kind.
-You're insane.

594
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,257
Did he seem sick or tired?

595
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,802
-I love his new hair color.
-It's ash brown.

596
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,180
-It's new.
-Look how pretty he is!

597
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,891
Seriously?
Why is he blocking our dear Si-an?

598
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,977
He even made eye-contact with your camera.

599
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,520
Move.

600
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,774
This is the guy
that called our Si-an a loser.

601
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,780
I think I've seen him somewhere,
but I can't remember.

602
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,492
Delicate lines
and coherent facial features.

603
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,495
The perfect ratio is its characteristic.

604
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,455
Don't tell me you're talking
about yourself.

605
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,790
Do you want it?

606
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,710
Hey. That's the guy from before.

607
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,672
That lunatic who took Si-an's
favorite painting from me in China.

608
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,839
Do you remember?

609
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,634
I can't believe
I've met this lunatic again here.

610
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,387
That lunatic is not the problem right now.

611
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,974
Sindy posted a preview
of Si-an controlling his fans in his car.

612
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,810
Hey, Sindy's got nothing on me.

613
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,645
The Road to Si-an
is the queen of photoshopping.

614
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,358
Gosh, how many photos did this guy ruin?

615
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,577
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN IN THE UNIVERSE
CHA SI-AN

616
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,836
Gosh, seriously.

617
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,798
"Do you want it?" Please.

618
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,009
What are you glaring at?

619
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,594
Look at those mean-looking eyes.

620
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,305
I'll blur out your eyes.

621
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,232
WHITE OCEAN, CHA SI-AN'S FANCLUB

622
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,859
Shall I post it now?

623
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,240
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

624
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:35,999
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

625
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,959
I'd like to welcome everyone

626
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,588
who have come to the first exhibition room
of The Road to Si-an.

627
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,717
I will only invite 100 people
on a first-come-first-served basis,

628
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,302
so I hope you understand.

629
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,470
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

630
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,514
EXHIBITION ROOM 1

631
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,642
The first picture you will see is...

632
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,398
SI-AN IN MY HEART, MY ONLY HOPE SI-AN

633
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:03,526
Si-an smiling brightly as he sees his fans

634
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,320
waiting for him at the airport gate.

635
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,322
Do you see that heart-shaped smile
that he only shows

636
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,116
-when he's genuinely happy?
-It's killing me.

637
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,284
He's so adorable.

638
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,872
Then let's move on to the next piece.

639
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,211
EXHIBITION ROOM 2

640
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,214
I know you have waited long.

641
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,633
It's a picture of Si-an from the side.

642
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,136
Si-an. I love you, Si-an.

643
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,430
It's time for the last highlight.

644
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,391
It's a super rare item
from this airport preview.

645
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,893
His 45-degree neck angle

646
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,270
and his cute face peeping out
is the main point.

647
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,189
I present to you, Peeping Si-an.

648
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,233
I'll stay here all night.

649
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,612
-Me too.
-I love Si-an.

650
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,491
Look at that.

651
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,078
He stole all our hearts.

652
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,499
PEEPING SI-AN IS SO CUTE
PLEASE LOOK AT ME, I LOVE YOU

653
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,251
HE'S SO HANDSOME

654
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,252
HE'S SO CHARISMATIC

655
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,753
HE'S A ONE AND ONLY

656
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,693
-Good morning.
-Hi.

657
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,992
Is it true Director Eom resigned?

658
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,369
Did you hear?

659
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,829
I couldn't tell you since she asked me

660
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,123
to keep it a secret
until the official announcement.

661
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,042
Oh, thank you, god.

662
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,627
You seem too happy.

663
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,380
Ms. Sung, it's finally time
for us to work happily.

664
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,885
Even if Director Eom's not here,
there's a lot of work to do.

665
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,262
I look forward to your hard work.

666
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,514
-The next director--
-You don't have to worry

667
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,600
about communication
with the next director.

668
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,977
You know I speak English
on a native level.

669
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,064
Communication? English?

670
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,650
You didn't hear yet?

671
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,612
The next director is a foreigner.

672
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,950
Ms. Sung?

673
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,578
Where is Director Eom

674
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,288
right now?

675
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,628
DIRECTOR EOM SO-HYE ANNOUNCES
HER RESIGNATION

676
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,547
Please share a word with us.

677
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,174
Please say something.

678
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,676
Please get out of the way.

679
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,554
We'll inform you later
about the press conference.

680
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,931
THE NEW DIRECTOR WILL BE A FOREIGNER

681
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,682
Please move. Please make ways.

682
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,435
-Move!
-Can you please say something?

683
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,493
Why did you do that to me?

684
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,497
Tell me. Why did you do that to me?

685
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,708
I've thought about it so much.

686
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,378
But I really don't understand.

687
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,381
Tell me.

688
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,634
I've worked for you for five years!

689
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,595
I've slaved for you like a dog!

690
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,683
Tell me.

691
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,102
Say something.

692
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,230
I said, say something!

693
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,483
You

694
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,945
have insulted me.

695
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,502
I can't let that wench
who grabbed me by my hair

696
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,425
take away the dog I've raised
all this time.

697
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,232
Ms. Sung?

698
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,948
Is it that heavy?

699
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,160
What did you bring that for?
I don't like fruit.

700
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,913
Since you brought it, put it over there.

701
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,544
How are you feeling?

702
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,381
My husband said my resignation
wouldn't be enough

703
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,884
and told me to put on a show
by being hospitalized.

704
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:39,927
Did you watch the news?

705
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,471
Didn't I look really ill?

706
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,600
Yes. By the way,

707
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,269
about the next director--

708
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,564
I've chosen the perfect successor

709
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,400
that will help me take advantage
of the media.

710
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,904
You just keep up your good work
like you've always done.

711
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,328
Do you want a banana?

712
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,005
We've already hired someone else
for the manager of Brand Marketing Team.

713
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,194
-I feel humiliated.
-For what?

714
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,946
She's the one who sold out her conscience.

715
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:44,075
I've learned that she had no conscience
for the last five years.

716
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,910
But I still trusted her.

717
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,246
Director Eom is right.

718
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,248
I think

719
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,417
my greed has made me go mad.

720
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,376
Hey.

721
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,628
Don't let that gibberish get to you.

722
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,427
What should you do
when the reality is messed up?

723
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,429
-Fangirling.
-Right, fangirling.

724
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,763
-Let's go.
-Where?

725
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,223
Pilgrimage.

726
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,307
Pilgrimage is

727
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,227
visiting the places
your favorite celebrities have gone to

728
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,730
and feeling the traces they left.

729
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,276
This is driving me nuts.

730
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,445
Wait for me!

731
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,431
I've left it in the lobby,
just like you asked.

732
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,739
-We're going to check in.
-Seon-ju.

733
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,325
Let's just go.

734
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,912
The suite Si-an stayed at
is really expensive.

735
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,335
Duk-mi, my dad's a landlord.

736
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,672
My goodness.

737
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,091
Wait for me.

738
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,517
-Thank you.
-Sir.

739
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,520
Secretary Kim asked us
to give you a different room.

740
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,273
Here's the key to your suite.

741
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,155
Welcome. How can I help you?

742
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,450
We'd like to stay
in Room 3250, your suite.

743
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:54,413
I'm sorry, ma'am. Someone else
checked in that suite just now.

744
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:55,540
Just now?

745
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,751
Would you like another room?

746
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,253
No, it's okay.

747
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,967
I was going to take advantage
of having a rich friend,

748
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,343
but I guess today isn't a good day.

749
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,721
I'm grateful for the gesture,
but you can save it for next time.

750
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:15,685
I'm a fangirl that never retreats.
I always go forward.

751
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,312
Where are you going? "Retreat"?

752
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,313
Hey, wait!

753
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,774
Ma'am, is this yours?

754
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,150
Oh, yes.

755
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,713
Excuse me.

756
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,424
Excuse me.

757
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,554
Are you the guest
who's staying in Room 3250?

758
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,641
Can we switch rooms?

759
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,643
-What?
-You must be flabbergasted.

760
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,313
-I know I'm being rude, but--
-Do you?

761
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,481
If you do, then you shouldn't ask.

762
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,692
I never

763
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,194
expect to get anything for free.

764
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,113
I'll give you some money out of gratitude.

765
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,198
How much would you like?

766
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,285
I have an unexplainable reason
for doing this.

767
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,704
And what exactly is that?

768
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,372
Well, that's...

769
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:22,335
I'd like to know why I must put up
with your rude behavior.

770
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,462
I told you. It's unexplainable.

771
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,091
Do you not want this?

772
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,180
I'll tell you.

773
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,474
Will you switch rooms if I tell you?

774
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,059
The thing is...

775
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,187
I'm on a pilgrimage.

776
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,813
Well...

777
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,232
I like this person.

778
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:48,277
And that person once stayed in that suite.

779
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,822
But we're not exactly able
to see each other very easily.

780
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,249
By the way, haven't we met before?

781
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,099
Cheers.

782
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,735
I'm the one who got betrayed
by Director Eom.

783
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,696
But why are you the one
who looks so upset?

784
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,906
I know we're here to make you feel better.

785
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,535
But I really looked forward
to fangirling with you

786
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:38,828
since it's been a while.

787
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,455
It reminded me of how things were
before I got married.

788
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,126
Why did I get married?

789
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,254
You shouldn't say that.
You're crazy about your son.

790
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,048
Of course, I love Geon-u.

791
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,676
You should be more affectionate
toward your husband.

792
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:54,844
He's your soulmate.

793
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:55,970
Duk-mi.

794
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,973
The person who you must meet in your life

795
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:02,309
-is not a soul mate.
-Then who?

796
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,145
A fangirl mate.

797
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:08,024
My goodness. Hey, what time is it?

798
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,734
Si-an is performing on a music show today.

799
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,820
-I must be crazy. I totally forgot.
-Here you go.

800
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,447
Gosh.

801
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,498
I thought she was here
to meet the person she loves.

802
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,671
I like this person.

803
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,299
But we're not

804
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,469
exactly able to see each other
very easily.

805
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:45,352
-Look at his face.
-He must be exciting.

806
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,360
Naturally assuming
that the person she loves

807
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,197
would be a guy is a biased thought
and an act of discrimination.

808
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:00,409
On top of that, she mustered up
her courage and told me the truth.

809
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,415
I can't believe I didn't believe her.

810
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,878
I'm so disappointed in myself.

811
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,636
Take my heart.

812
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:20,846
I love you.

813
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,640
It's over now.

814
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,061
That made me so happy.

815
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,563
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Okay.

816
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,615
Wait.

817
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,422
I'm about to cry.

818
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,967
This is unbelievable.

819
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,594
Seon-ju, I love you.

820
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,930
-My gosh!
-This is amazing.

821
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,682
This is what Si-an used!

822
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,517
Is Si-an there?

823
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,689
-Shoot it from the same angle.
-This is Si-an looking depressed.

824
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:12,857
Good.

825
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,650
Open your mouth a little.

826
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,738
I'll take one with the drink.

827
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,240
One, two, three.

828
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:22,741
Do you see his skin?

829
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,912
-We just locked eyes.
-My gosh.

830
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,831
-I think he just looked at me.
-You wish.

831
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,251
My gosh. Hey.

832
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,461
This is why you have to be young
to be a fangirl.

833
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,338
I'm already exhausted
from laughing so much.

834
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,091
But I have to say,
I had so much fun thanks to you.

835
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,260
I'll repay you once I get a new job.

836
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,804
Are you really going to quit?

837
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,930
Of course.

838
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,184
I can't stay there
after getting humiliated by Director Eom.

839
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,686
I'm going to throw a resignation letter

840
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:52,646
at her face tomorrow.

841
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,482
What are you going to do after that?
Do you have a plan?

842
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,527
Of course, I do.

843
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,656
First, I'm going to buy a lottery ticket
at a convenience store.

844
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,535
And then, I'm going to win the lottery.

845
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,121
Hey. What kind of plan is that?

846
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,875
A plan should be realistic and detailed.

847
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,419
I didn't expect you to say that.

848
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,048
You need to dream of a pig first.

849
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,008
No, wait. You should dream
of the president.

850
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,093
That's more like it.

851
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,555
If I win the lottery, I'm going to...

852
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,058
Oh, right. Si-an will be holding
a signing event soon.

853
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,018
I'll buy 1,000 albums for each of us.

854
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,229
I'll buy 2,000 albums in total
and go to the event.

855
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,439
I'll also send stuff
to where he shoots his TV show.

856
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:38,150
I'll send a food truck,
a snack truck, a coffee truck,

857
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,027
and a churros truck.

858
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,155
By the way, why did the guy
suddenly offer to switch rooms?

859
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,282
I don't know.

860
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:48,661
But he really did seem familiar.

861
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,413
I'm sure I saw him somewhere,
but I can't remember.

862
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,084
I tend to forget things easily
after I gave birth to Geon-u.

863
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,211
Stop blaming it on Geon-u.

864
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,713
You were always like that.
You're practically face-blind.

865
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,802
How about we write
your resignation letter?

866
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,098
My beloved Director Eom...

867
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:12,142
"Beloved"?
Gosh, let's get rid of that. Seriously.

868
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:14,728
It's already in the past now.
Forget about it.

869
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,483
CHEUM MUSEUM OF ART
HALL 1, HALL 2

870
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,619
Whatever happens,
I should come to work first.

871
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:41,565
Do you work here?

872
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,233
Yes, just a moment.

873
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,112
May I help you?

874
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,336
Do you want it?

875
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,135
Do you want it?

876
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,347
My gosh!

877
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,019
I'd like to introduce
to you the new director.

878
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,563
The type who succumbs to power?

879
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,815
-You should keep it up.
-Director Gold.

880
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:07,109
Even lunatics fall into
different categories.

881
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,819
We'll also lose three things.

882
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:12,448
Mr. Ahn's trust, reputation in
the industry, and peace within the museum.

883
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,616
Get out. You're fired.

884
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:15,826
Fired?

885
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:17,703
Cha Si-an of White Ocean.
You don't know him?

886
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,746
Why would she do something
she can't even take care of?

887
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,373
She asked who I learned work from.

888
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,041
-Ms. Sung!
-I got my revenge.

889
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,293
To the director?

890
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,419
Do you think I'll die alone?

891
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,336
SI-AN

892
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,464
