1
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,794
Duk-mi,

2
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,756
doesn't my head feel heavy?

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,137
It seems like your arm has gone numb.

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,850
No, it's not heavy at all.

5
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,394
Your head is lighter than I thought.

6
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,612
Thank you for sharing your secret with me.

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,450
I'm thankful too.

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,079
For being a person
who I can talk to comfortably.

9
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,422
It's a secret that I've kept to myself
for three years.

10
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,551
Now that I've gotten it out,
I feel so relieved.

11
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,720
I know.

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,809
I'll lend you my ear again
whenever you need it.

13
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,147
You've lent me your hand,
and even your ear.

14
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,982
What shall I lend you?

15
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,069
Well...

16
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,199
I'll give that some more thought.

17
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,827
Can you write me a promissory note?

18
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,707
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,720
Director Gold, I'll take you home tonight.

20
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,931
-You will?
-Yes.

21
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,309
-How will you take me home?
-We'll take your car.

22
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,229
How can that be taking me home?

23
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,399
I'll be driving my car to my home.

24
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,568
So? Does that mean no?

25
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,237
No,

26
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,780
I love it.

27
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,617
Let's go.

28
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,214
Didn't you say you would take me home?

29
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,008
We're here now.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,885
It isn't your home yet.

31
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,845
Up to the front door then?

32
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,180
You want me to just leave?

33
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,266
What shall we do then?

34
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,519
Since we did something I'm good at
last time, it's your turn tonight.

35
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,021
Something I'm good at?

36
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,154
You promised to do something I'm good at.

37
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,824
Whatever it is,
it won't be easy beating me.

38
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,785
-Do you really think so?
-Yes.

39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,580
You'll see.

40
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,753
Ryan! Hello, Ms. Sung.

41
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,837
Hello.

42
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,262
This is Ryan, who lives upstairs,
and his girlfriend.

43
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,264
He likes me a lot.

44
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,518
Si-an must pester you so much.

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,396
Oh, this is my mom.

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,152
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ryan Gold.

47
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,529
Hello, I'm Sung Duk-mi.

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,533
Si-an gets lonely easily
so he likes company.

49
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,160
He's not a weirdo or anything.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,789
Mom, you're making me sound
like a real weirdo.

51
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,839
Ryan, Ms. Sung, goodnight.

52
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,178
Mr. Cha.

53
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,349
The damaged painting
has been restored successfully.

54
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,310
Okay.

55
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,281
I knew it.

56
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,116
Knew what?

57
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,494
I wondered who Si-an took after
to be so handsome,

58
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,371
and his mom is so beautiful.

59
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,248
I guess that's the power of genes, right?

60
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,043
Oh, you must've come here
to see Cha Si-an.

61
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,379
Why don't you just go after him then?

62
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,505
Can I?

63
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,975
It's your painting, right?

64
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,853
You remembered these paintings?

65
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,230
Of course, I did.

66
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,649
You were extremely upset.

67
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,110
When grandpa got rid of them
without telling you.

68
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,239
I wanted to find all of them,
but it wasn't easy.

69
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,952
I think I'll be able to find a few more
before the exhibition.

70
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,750
Mom, that guy in the elevator
is the director of a museum.

71
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,877
He's very famous for his taste in art.

72
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,920
He suggested it first.

73
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,966
He said he liked your paintings
and wanted to exhibit them.

74
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,469
Si-an.

75
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,808
I'm really grateful
that you found these for me,

76
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,312
but I don't want to

77
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,565
exhibit these paintings.

78
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,320
This painting...

79
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,572
These paintings are--

80
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,531
I know.

81
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,575
I know, Mom.

82
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,660
I know what you mean,

83
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,579
but can you...

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,541
Can you just do it for yourself?

85
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,254
Can't you be selfish just this once?

86
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,841
No, I can't do that.

87
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,677
And I shouldn't.

88
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,474
Then what about for me?

89
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,270
Can you at least think about it
for my sake?

90
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,648
Will you?

91
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,863
Let's eat something, Mom. I'm hungry.

92
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,991
I'll be outside.

93
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,010
I finally understand

94
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,721
why you got so angry at me

95
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,348
when I entered this room that day.

96
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,808
Back then--

97
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,852
I'm not trying to get an apology
out of you.

98
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,313
I just want to tell you that I'm relieved

99
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,692
that I got the chance to know
and understand you better.

100
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,361
And I'm the one who owes you an apology.

101
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,948
I'm sorry

102
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,033
for thoughtlessly judging

103
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,453
this painting at the auction house.

104
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,329
I didn't mean what I said.

105
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,539
I understand

106
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,042
because I know you well now.

107
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,337
Plus, you weren't entirely wrong.

108
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,048
What's your opinion about this painting

109
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,300
as a museum director?

110
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,179
It looks sad

111
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,764
and nervous.

112
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,019
Those bubbles could burst at any moment.

113
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,105
It's as if the artist tried
to portray her reality.

114
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,982
Here's what I think.

115
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,779
I don't really feel nervous thinking that
those bubbles might burst at any moment.

116
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,699
To me, although they're fragile,

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,868
they look like bubbles of hope
that could fly up

118
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,369
at any moment into the sky.

119
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,667
Paintings can have different meanings

120
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,252
depending on how someone looks at them.

121
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,714
I hope you'll

122
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,801
also be able to look
at that painting like that one day.

123
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,600
Can I finally

124
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,561
do what I want to do now?

125
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,233
What's that?

126
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,474
Oh, my goodness.

127
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,894
-Dad.
-Eun-gi, get in here. Hurry.

128
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,021
Close the doors.

129
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,023
-Hurry.
-Dad, what's wrong?

130
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,191
What's the matter?

131
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,945
-What?
-Gosh.

132
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,905
Dad!

133
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,657
Hello.

134
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,952
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

135
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,620
Dad.

136
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,551
What are you doing?

137
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,345
I'm brilliant at pretty much everything.

138
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,932
Day or night.

139
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,857
My gosh, how did a coward like you

140
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,777
end up losing all our money
by doing business? Here.

141
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,823
-Water. Water.
-Here's your water.

142
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,784
-Mom, who is this kid?
-Oh, her?

143
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,078
-She's Duk-mi's colleague.
-I'm a tenant.

144
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,958
You said you'll let me use Ms. Sung's room

145
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,209
if I ran away from home.

146
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,252
Who told you that?

147
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,591
That's my room.

148
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,135
How much does this mister pay?

149
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,638
Did you just call me mister?

150
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,264
I'll pay twice the amount.

151
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,350
Hey, it doesn't matter
how much you're willing to pay.

152
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,603
-Can I just have three more scoops?
-Three more scoops?

153
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,737
Eat four more scoops.

154
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,701
We're here.

155
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,258
Nice try. Don't you think
it's a bit too late?

156
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,641
You should go home, Mr. Card Shark.

157
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,642
"Card shark"?

158
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,185
What's a card shark?

159
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,603
A card shark is...

160
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,897
Just watch the movie.

161
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,483
Drive safely.

162
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,403
Thank you.

163
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,698
Thank you.

164
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,318
EUN-GI

165
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,167
EUN-GI

166
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,217
What?

167
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,096
What's going on? Why is Hyo-jin there?

168
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,765
Why don't you ask her yourself?

169
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,230
Hello, Ms. Sung.

170
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,942
Ms. Kim, why are you
at my parents' house with a suitcase?

171
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,195
Well, the thing is, I went home
after I got off work and...

172
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,121
Mom.

173
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,499
Kim Hyo-jin, you dared

174
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,126
to go against my word

175
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,171
in front of Mr. Gold.

176
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,840
Do you still think of me as your mother?

177
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,176
Mom, let me explain.

178
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,680
It was very impressive.

179
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,558
You're my daughter,

180
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,601
so it's natural
that you're so high in spirit.

181
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,898
But the problem is that you used
that spirit to go against me.

182
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,692
Mom, that's because

183
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,070
I really wanted my product
to become a huge hit

184
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,781
-for the fifth-anniversary exhibition.
-Right.

185
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,909
So does this have nothing to do
with Cha Si-an?

186
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,287
That's right.
He has nothing to do with this.

187
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,246
Okay, fine.

188
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,915
You can go ahead with the exhibition.

189
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,919
But instead, you're going to have to live

190
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,506
without your car, credit card, and camera

191
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,966
until the exhibition is over.

192
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,137
Okay, I'll do that.

193
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,684
You also can't come home.

194
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,019
What?

195
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,645
Mr. Kim.

196
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,869
That means we'll be able to hold
the Celebrity Collectors' Exhibition

197
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,038
if you let me stay here.

198
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,707
It's great that we'll be able
to hold the exhibition,

199
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,792
but why did you choose to stay
at my mom's of all places?

200
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,170
Isn't it the head curator's job

201
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,089
to make sure the exhibition goes well?

202
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,883
-What's your point?
-Then,

203
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,344
you should let me stay here
since I made it happen.

204
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,224
I think this room is cursed.

205
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,976
Only crazy people come here.

206
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,353
Hey, you used that room as well.

207
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,022
-I can't be as bad as you.
-Hey.

208
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,234
Duk-mi.

209
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:45,986
What?

210
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,448
Mom wants you to come home
on our birthday.

211
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,826
I think I'm going to be busy that day.

212
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,870
Really?

213
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,915
Okay, then. I'll tell Mom.

214
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,500
Okay, bye.

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,465
Mister, what time do you go
to work tomorrow?

216
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,093
It's close to the museum I work at.

217
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,846
This audacity of yours

218
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,181
is very familiar.

219
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,517
Also, don't call me mister.

220
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,813
"Also, don't call me mister."

221
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,238
-Yes, Ms. Yu.
-I'm sorry for calling this late.

222
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,864
It's all right. What's this about?

223
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,283
The catalog needs to be printed.

224
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,369
How are we supposed
to introduce Artist Lee Sol?

225
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,620
Oh, that.

226
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,998
Leave it blank for now.

227
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,249
Do we revise it tomorrow?

228
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,875
Yes, will you do it yourself?

229
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,960
Yes, I will.

230
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,712
Also, we have the exhibition

231
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,924
mapped out for all nine pieces by Lee Sol.

232
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,052
Shouldn't we have a contingency plan
just in case we can't find them all?

233
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,014
It won't be easy to locate the rest.

234
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,935
We still have some time left,
so let's keep trying.

235
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:00,978
I'll do what I can,

236
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,772
so call galleries and collectors
that you know as well.

237
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,482
Sure, I'll do my best.

238
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,443
-Goodnight then.
-You too.

239
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,783
Since it all started
from Lee Sol's painting,

240
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,495
I thought I might find an answer

241
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,372
if I collect all of her works.

242
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,959
But he used to make beautiful paintings.

243
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,300
Let's just hurry
and find the other pieces.

244
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,136
Editor Nam, this is Duk-mi.

245
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,846
Could we meet tomorrow?

246
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,057
Where should we meet?

247
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,767
I'll call you tomorrow.

248
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,448
If you know about Artist Lee Sol

249
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,242
or about the whereabouts
of paintings similar to these,

250
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,786
please contact me.

251
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,812
Hello, Director Gold.

252
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,108
-Oh, hello.
-Did I surprise you?

253
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,652
If you haven't had breakfast yet,
please have these.

254
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,987
I made some more while cooking for Si-an.

255
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,492
I'm not a good cook,
but my sandwiches aren't bad.

256
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,955
Thank you. I bet I'll enjoy these.

257
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,499
This is actually an apology.

258
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,419
Judging by how Si-an was,
I could tell he's been a nuisance to you.

259
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,005
He hasn't been that bad.

260
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,966
Now that he isn't living
with his band members,

261
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,468
I think he's been lonely at times.

262
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,304
He's been asking me
to come to Korea to see him.

263
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,431
I'm relieved to know that he has

264
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,100
a great friend like you as a neighbor,

265
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,434
so thank you for that.

266
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,145
Please don't mention it.

267
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,150
You must've been getting ready for work.

268
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,194
-Don't let me keep you.
-Thanks.

269
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,513
GOLD LION

270
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,103
Ms. Sung.

271
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,397
-Yes, Director Gold.
-Where are you right now?

272
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,815
Are you at work?

273
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,776
No, I'm still at home.
I was on my way out though.

274
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,862
-Hurry on out then.
-Sorry?

275
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,405
Where are you?

276
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,536
I'm glad you were still home.

277
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,080
I thought something was up.

278
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,458
-Something is up.
-And what's that?

279
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,381
What's all this? Breakfast?

280
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,761
Cha Si-an's mother made this herself.

281
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,596
Really? Why?

282
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,098
To thank me for being friends
with her son.

283
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,391
Is that so?

284
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,769
Could I take a photo first?

285
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,492
What's with all this glaring?

286
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,119
I was just looking at my handsome lion.

287
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,206
Because of the sandwich made
by Cha Si-an's mom?

288
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,752
No, it's because you thought of me
when you received it.

289
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,297
Thank you.

290
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
You got lipstick on your cheek.

291
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,725
I like things to be symmetrical,

292
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,977
so make it look even.

293
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,478
That's all for today.

294
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,996
INCOMING CALL
CHA SI-AN

295
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,544
-Yes, Mr. Cha.
-Ryan,

296
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,963
I'd like to ask a favor,
which may be too much.

297
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,381
Say yes.

298
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,966
I'll hear what it is first.

299
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,343
I'd like to visit the museum with my mom,

300
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,430
but people might recognize me
if we go during business hours.

301
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,724
So you want a private viewing
after we close?

302
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,143
Yes, just this once.

303
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,105
I'll think about...

304
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,277
It's a one-time deal.

305
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,987
Sure thing. Thanks, Ryan.

306
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,780
I'm grateful too.

307
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,286
I should get back early
from the print shop today.

308
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,080
You'll become a lucky fan today.

309
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,582
But I already am.

310
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,474
Rendezvous paper seems like
the best choice for this piece.

311
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,600
Okay.

312
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,394
I'd like it in a higher concentration
of blue

313
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,939
-and in a brighter tone.
-Got it.

314
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,066
Duk-mi.

315
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,154
You didn't have to come here.
I was going to head to your office.

316
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,823
It's fine.
I had some business here anyway.

317
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,243
Your birthday is coming up,
so what would you like?

318
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,162
What should I ask for?

319
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,914
Ask away. Your wish is my command.

320
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,207
Nothing too expensive though.

321
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,418
I know what I want.

322
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,878
The original photo of Director Gold

323
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,089
that made the cover of your magazine.

324
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,345
You must really like this guy.

325
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,640
All right. You can even have those
that didn't make the cut.

326
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,724
Really?

327
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,560
Are you making the catalog
for the exhibition?

328
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,561
Yes.

329
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,189
Editor Nam, I wanted to ask you something.

330
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,024
-Yes.
-By any chance,

331
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,861
have you heard of a painter named Lee Sol?

332
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,530
Lee Sol?

333
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,031
Given the unique name,

334
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,326
I would've remembered
if I had heard of this artist.

335
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,164
Then do you know an artist
with this style and these techniques?

336
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,875
You check exhibitions
for rookie artists too,

337
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,418
so I thought you'd know.

338
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,587
Hold on.

339
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,298
I think I've seen this style before.

340
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,842
-Really?
-Yes.

341
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,718
Actually, I'm sure of it.

342
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,220
I've seen paintings like this before.

343
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,472
Gosh.

344
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,726
-Darn menopause.
-Please let me know if you recall.

345
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,019
I will.

346
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
-It's this way.
-Thank you.

347
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,988
I finally remembered.

348
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,241
It was during my senior year in college.

349
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,077
I don't remember her name,

350
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,039
but there was a freshman that caught
the eyes of all the professors.

351
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,208
HANGUK UNIVERSITY
GRADUATION PROJECTS

352
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,211
I heard she went to study abroad
after graduation,

353
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,006
but I've never heard any news
of her debut.

354
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,341
There were rumors about her giving birth.

355
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,678
These paintings seem similar to hers.

356
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,436
Did you say her name was Lee Sol though?

357
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,817
GONG EUN-YEONG, CLASS OF 1982

358
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,588
-Dad.
-Yes?

359
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,840
What's love?

360
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,178
Love?

361
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,431
Love seems to be so difficult.

362
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,308
Geon-u, have you been in love?

363
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,311
With Na-yeong in Class Yellow.

364
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,690
How does Na-yeong feel?

365
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,818
Does she love you too?

366
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,325
She likes an older boy in Class Blue.

367
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,744
He's tall and good-looking.

368
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,164
I guess I should apologize.

369
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,795
Geon-u, can't you like
a different girl then?

370
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,463
It doesn't work that way.

371
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,051
Today, I fell on the ground
in front of her

372
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,970
on purpose.

373
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,018
Like this.

374
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,356
Because I feel happy when Na-yeong laughs.

375
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,902
Dad, this is love, right?

376
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,992
Goodness.

377
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,661
You're better than me.

378
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,456
Here, drink this.

379
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,717
Oh, this is my mom.

380
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,052
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ryan Gold.

381
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,643
GONG EUN-YEONG, CLASS OF 1982

382
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,980
They might just have
similar painting techniques.

383
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,233
But if Lee Sol

384
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,277
is Cha Si-an's mother...

385
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,237
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

386
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,949
Before you go home tonight,
bring Lee Sol's restored painting

387
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,118
-from the storage room to my office.
-Okay.

388
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,757
Director Gold.

389
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,596
Do you plan

390
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,433
on looking at Lee Sol's painting
with Cha Si-an and his mother?

391
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,434
Yes.

392
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,145
I think the museum date is an excuse.

393
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,023
He's probably just coming
to see that painting.

394
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,943
What's wrong?

395
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,031
Well...

396
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,495
It's nothing.

397
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,135
Ryan. Ms. Sung.

398
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,349
I'm sorry my son keeps bothering you.

399
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,769
It's not because Mr. Cha asked,
but it's for you.

400
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,522
Your sandwiches were so delicious.

401
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,357
When did you eat it?

402
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,235
I brought him some in the morning.

403
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,320
Those are very special.

404
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,044
-I heard this is Jeon Yong-hwan's work.
-I see.

405
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,089
How about

406
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,508
you explain it to me?

407
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,218
It's difficult for me too.

408
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,638
-Mom, stay here for a second.
-Okay.

409
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,101
Ryan.

410
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,520
-Do you...
-Lee Sol's painting?

411
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,982
-Can I see it?
-I have it in my office.

412
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,482
Let me use the restroom.

413
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,942
I'll show her the way.

414
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,398
Are you okay?

415
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,862
Yes. It's been so long
since I last saw that painting.

416
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,452
You're Lee Sol, aren't you?

417
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,627
I saw a painting similar to Lee Sol's work

418
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,213
in an art thesis book from a university.

419
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,843
And I saw a picture of you next to it.

420
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,928
No.

421
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,597
I'm not Lee Sol anymore.

422
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,561
It's a name that I failed to protect.

423
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,358
It's a painting that I failed

424
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,528
to protect.

425
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,992
I don't deserve to be called
by that name now.

426
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,536
I don't want it to be known.

427
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,122
Do you understand?

428
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,125
Yes.

429
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,842
Do you think we'll be able
to find all nine paintings?

430
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,635
I really hope I can find all of them.

431
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,222
My employees are trying their best
to find them. And I'm doing so too.

432
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,393
By the way,

433
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,855
my mom might ask you a favor in secret.

434
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,232
What favor?

435
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,235
My mom doesn't like

436
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,738
that I'm exhibiting Lee Sol's paintings.

437
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,950
So you should persuade her.

438
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,579
Why is she against it?

439
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,707
Actually, I wanted to do this for her.

440
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,251
To make her dream come true.

441
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,596
I want to give it back to my mom.

442
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,806
The name, Lee Sol.

443
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,314
My mom has some hurtful memories
about those paintings.

444
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,527
Son.

445
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,156
Yes.

446
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,295
Mom.

447
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,690
Son.

448
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,025
Stop bothering Director Gold.

449
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,736
Director Gold and Ms. Sung
have to go home too.

450
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,995
Thank you for today's tour, Director Gold.

451
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,826
Let go! I'm not your mom.

452
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,495
Oh, this is my mom.

453
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:00,997
Son.

454
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,022
Am I disturbing you?

455
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,817
You can tell me if you want to be alone.

456
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,277
I'm okay with that.

457
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,622
Director Gold.

458
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,958
You know, right?

459
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,551
Duk-mi,

460
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,595
how do you know?

461
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,265
I found out by coincidence.

462
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,193
It feels a little weird.

463
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,571
I tried so hard to find her

464
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,867
for the past three years,
but I couldn't even find a clue.

465
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,955
But she suddenly showed up out of nowhere.

466
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,335
It doesn't feel real.

467
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,381
It feels like a lie.

468
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,137
I can't seem to

469
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,764
wrap my head around it.

470
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,561
If you don't want to talk
about it right now,

471
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,939
you don't need to.

472
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,195
Tell me if you need time to think alone.

473
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,363
Would you like to do that?

474
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,954
It's

475
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,373
ten right now.

476
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,084
So I'll give you 12 hours
until tomorrow morning.

477
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,005
It'll be hard, but I'll try my best
to give you space.

478
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,132
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

479
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,865
I saw someone painting that.

480
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,284
Before I became Ryan.

481
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,953
When I was Heo Yun-jae.

482
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,747
Mom.

483
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,461
Lee Sol.

484
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,464
She's probably someone I know.

485
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,967
I want to give it back to my mom.

486
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,011
The name, Lee Sol.

487
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,601
Son.

488
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,569
She's probably

489
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,738
my mom.

490
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,841
Even if you say you're okay,

491
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,719
your heart isn't.

492
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,806
It can't be okay.

493
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,374
Are you here for a drink?

494
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,795
Seon-ju's never around
when you need her. Don't you agree?

495
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,630
The same goes for you.

496
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,301
You're not around when I need a friend.

497
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,095
Should I cancel
what I said for a short while?

498
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,890
How about we go back in time?

499
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,940
What do you want for your birthday?

500
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,901
Let's buy gifts for our parents
starting this year.

501
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,446
I was born way too pretty thanks to them.

502
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,657
Okay. My gosh.

503
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,912
-Eun-gi.
-Yes?

504
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,333
Have you ever been curious about your dad?

505
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,794
-No.
-You liar.

506
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,296
How is that possible?

507
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,673
Even if it's a lie,

508
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,551
I'm going to keep lying until I die.

509
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,928
I'm not curious at all.

510
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,513
Why not?

511
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,474
I lived fine without him.

512
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,227
If I start getting curious,
it'll seem like I miss him.

513
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,859
Isn't it natural to miss him
and be curious about him?

514
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,987
Yes, it's natural.

515
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,075
But why isn't he curious about me?

516
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,411
Why doesn't he miss me?

517
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,707
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,837
And I couldn't predict how I'd feel.

519
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,884
I'd get annoyed if I found out
that he's not doing so well.

520
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,595
But I'd also get annoyed
if I found out that he's doing fine.

521
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,391
I tried to think
about which might be better,

522
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,268
but I erased it from my head
because it got complicated.

523
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,734
Why didn't you ever tell me this?

524
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,571
-I felt sorry.
-For what?

525
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,158
Mom, Dad, and you

526
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,413
treated me so nicely
and gave me everything I ever needed.

527
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,541
So it felt like an act of betrayal
to talk about my biological dad.

528
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,793
Eun-gi, you idiot.

529
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,380
Do you really think my mom and dad
won't be able to understand you?

530
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,464
Exactly.

531
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,926
That's why I'm just an idiotic Eun-gi,

532
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,970
not a man.

533
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,891
Hey, wait.

534
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,562
Are we no longer back in time?

535
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,813
No.

536
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,481
Then I'll be off now.

537
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,733
Okay, bye.

538
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,115
Eun-gi, you idiot.

539
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,618
You're my friend
whom I spent my entire life with.

540
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,037
It was nice to see you again.

541
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,811
Are you familiar with Lee Sol's work?

542
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,856
I found out by chance
that you owned one of Lee Sol's pieces.

543
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,900
By chance?

544
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,109
Can you

545
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,779
keep this a secret? Ryan.

546
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,823
Hi, I did.

547
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,283
Can you get the bill?

548
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,994
This isn't a coincidence. It must be fate.

549
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,963
Hey, Ryan.

550
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,342
It's too late. Let's talk next time.

551
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,260
There's something I forgot
to tell you earlier.

552
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,120
He wanted to be alone.

553
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,211
MOM

554
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,216
-Yes?
-Duk-mi, are you home?

555
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,634
Alone?

556
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,677
Yes.

557
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,139
A grown woman shouldn't be home
alone at night.

558
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,683
You should be with Director Gold.

559
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,562
Forget it. That's not my place
to meddle with.

560
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,147
Anyway, Eun-gi says he's busy

561
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,816
on your birthday this year.

562
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,151
-Did he say that?
-So,

563
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,487
you should spend it
with Director Gold this year

564
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,863
and give me a break.

565
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,948
Sure, you should get one

566
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,117
since you've been cooking my birthday meal
for 33 years now.

567
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,160
I'll treat you
to a hotel buffet this year.

568
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,581
Actually, I'd like to know
when Director Gold's birthday is.

569
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,416
-Why do you ask?
-I may not have to cook yours,

570
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,793
but I should make his.

571
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,171
And could you also ask
the time he was born too?

572
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,339
I'm hanging up now.

573
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,844
That little brat.

574
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,055
I was going to ask

575
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,600
the fortune-teller
about their compatibility.

576
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,477
That's not necessary.

577
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,272
It's obvious
that they're meant for each other,

578
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,815
just like you and me.

579
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,026
Don't even say that as a joke.

580
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:35,029
Director Gold might not know
when exactly he was born.

581
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,530
Why not?

582
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,741
He was adopted.

583
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,369
I heard he was adopted
to the States as a little boy.

584
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,579
Adopted?

585
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,298
I'm glad he grew up to be a decent man.

586
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,052
What a relief.

587
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,266
I'm sure he was raised

588
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,976
by amazing parents.

589
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,103
Right?

590
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,691
There are many nice people in this world.

591
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,703
-Hello?
-This is Director Nam.

592
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,413
Of which gallery?

593
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,291
I'm the director of Choikang Judo,
Nam Eun-gi.

594
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,501
Oh, you.

595
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,170
The loser?

596
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,090
Look who's talking.

597
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,634
I'm not the loser
who vomited after getting drunk.

598
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,554
To what do I owe this pleasure?

599
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,766
-What are you up to?
-I'm working.

600
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,103
You're working after moving on from Ryan?

601
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,439
I might have moved on,
but we still have a relationship.

602
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,859
The friendship between us
might actually last longer.

603
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,448
Don't drown in your sorrows for too long.

604
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,786
They say that it's better
to be single anyway.

605
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,623
It sounds like
you're enjoying my situation.

606
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,294
I wouldn't say that.
I just feel less lonely.

607
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,380
It's like having a comrade.

608
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,008
Call me if you'd like a drink.
I'm happy to return the favor.

609
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,346
I'd love nothing more
than to get drunk, but I won't.

610
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,975
I don't want to ruin
what you're working on either.

611
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,270
I should think with a clear head anyway.

612
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,064
Sure thing. Good luck then.

613
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,357
All right.

614
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,530
Friendship?

615
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,721
SUNG DUK-MI

616
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,726
Knock, knock.

617
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,228
This is a bit late for a wake-up call.

618
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,563
Could you open the door?

619
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,148
What?

620
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,781
Duk-mi?

621
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,243
It was so hard to wait for 12 hours,
so I had to cave in.

622
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:33,540
I'm glad. I nearly caved in first.

623
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,459
I should've held out a little longer then.

624
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,669
You held out enough.

625
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,006
Have you had breakfast?

626
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,799
Even if you have, say that you haven't.

627
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,026
What?

628
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,863
Waiting and wondering burns
a lot of your energy.

629
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,076
So you caved in because you were hungry

630
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,786
and not because you missed me.

631
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,792
You know what? I'm full. I'm done eating.

632
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,710
No, go ahead.

633
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,089
Have I ever told you

634
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,716
that you look stunning when you're eating?

635
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,808
Aren't you going to ask

636
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,937
about me and her?

637
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,568
You told me before

638
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,321
that I shouldn't make any hasty decisions
about Eun-gi.

639
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,246
You shouldn't make
a hasty decision either.

640
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:58,208
Just don't forget
that you have someone on your side.

641
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,544
All right?

642
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,477
I had coffee. An espresso, actually.

643
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,526
Rinse your mouth then.

644
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,534
Ms. Sung.

645
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,580
Here are the estimates
regarding the new exhibition merchandise.

646
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,540
Considering the demand as well
as the production cost

647
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,083
and the selling price,

648
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,170
the target customers will mostly be women

649
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,340
in their mid 20s to late 40s.

650
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,509
That being said, a reasonable price
would be around 25,000 won per piece.

651
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,182
I'm the daughter of the head of TK Group.

652
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,226
Economics is a required subject I learn.

653
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,814
Good job. Ms. Kim, could you do the same

654
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,234
for the catalog and the postcards too?

655
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,527
Sure thing.

656
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,661
-Hello?
-Hi, Ms. Sung.

657
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,079
Cha...

658
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,083
How can I help you?

659
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,336
If it's okay with you,
could we meet in private?

660
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,171
Just the two of us?

661
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,548
Hello, Ms. Sung.

662
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,176
I know you're busy,
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

663
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:34,596
It's all right. I would never miss
a meeting with you.

664
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,808
It's actually about Ryan.

665
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,018
Director Gold?

666
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,273
I think he's upset
because of the exhibition.

667
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,442
I wasn't trying to fool anybody,

668
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,153
but it turned out to be that way.

669
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,573
I'm sure that's not it.

670
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,451
He wouldn't get angry
over something like that.

671
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,787
-Right?
-Of course.

672
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,001
Actually, I wanted to participate
in this exhibition for my mom.

673
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:10,006
She injured her hand in an accident
before she gave birth to me,

674
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,551
and that ended her career as an artist.

675
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,845
An accident?

676
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,472
Are you okay?

677
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,646
The only pieces that she painted
as Lee Sol

678
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,565
were those of the bubbles.

679
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,444
But my grandfather threw them all out

680
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,279
so that she could move on.

681
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,199
It really tore her apart.

682
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,538
Her paintings were
the only memories she had left,

683
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,123
so it broke her heart.

684
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,213
She has always been my fan,

685
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,426
so I want to be hers this time around
and make her dream come true.

686
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,180
I'd appreciate it if you helped me

687
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,806
fulfill her dreams.

688
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,851
Sure.

689
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,436
That's great.

690
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,022
I'm putting my trust in you, Ms. Sung.

691
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:20,952
What do you think?

692
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,037
ART DIRECTOR RYAN GOLD

693
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,622
The concept seems fine.

694
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,333
It's more intuitive
like I mentioned before.

695
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,252
I guess you got out of your slump then.

696
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,505
A genius like me
never goes through a slump.

697
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,466
You know I'm a top media artist,
Choi Da-in, right?

698
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,051
Of course, you are.

699
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,677
All right, talk to you later.

700
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,818
Mom, look at this.

701
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,119
LIST OF ARTWORK FOR EXHIBITION

702
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,258
Hello?

703
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,558
Yes, hello.

704
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,154
Why did she draw nine paintings
of bubbles?

705
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,301
LIST OF ARTWORK FOR EXHIBITION

706
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,386

707
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,847
amusement park?

708
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,364
Bubbles,

709
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,784
children.

710
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,748
She always had things Yun-jae liked

711
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,833
in her mind.

712
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,274
What is it? Is something wrong?

713
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,027
Your mother called me earlier.

714
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,321
She reminded me
that your birthday's coming up.

715
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,323
Gosh, what is wrong with my mom?

716
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,868
She told me
that you're planning on having dinner

717
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,912
with your boyfriend that day.

718
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,872
But I didn't hear anything.

719
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,708
Do you have another boyfriend, besides me?

720
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:18,505
I just didn't say anything
because I didn't want to bother you.

721
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,757
I had my own plan too, you know.

722
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,052
How could you not mention anything
about your birthday like that?

723
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,597
You even left me alone
for ten hours yesterday.

724
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,808
You said you wanted to be alone yesterday.

725
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,686
I even went an hour earlier today
to say hi.

726
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,647
Still, how could you not call
or text me all day?

727
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,273
Gosh.

728
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,609
Fine. From now on,

729
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,903
I'll never leave you alone
no matter how much you insist.

730
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,322
I'll even follow you
to the bathroom from now on.

731
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,157
-Really?
-Don't regret it.

732
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,284
That sounds good.

733
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:57,210
Oh, your mom asked me
about the date and time of my birth.

734
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,294
What was that for?

735
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,381
Well, I guess she needed
that information for something.

736
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,008
Why does she need the time for?

737
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,592
My mom is into fortune-telling.

738
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,094
It's probably for our compatibility.

739
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,475
I mean, it's just for her curiosity
for Eastern philosophy.

740
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,561
I know what compatibility is too.

741
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,524
My mom tends to get ahead of herself.

742
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,486
What should I do then?

743
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,448
I don't know the time of my birth.

744
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,201
Director Gold.

745
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,204
When do you

746
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,418
celebrate your birthday?

747
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,381
September. The day I was adopted.

748
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,304
Aren't you curious
about your real birthday?

749
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,442
Shall we find out
when your real birthday is?

750
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,574
It's a name that I failed to protect.

751
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,035
It's a painting that I failed

752
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,497
to protect.

753
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,127
I'm not asking you to forgive her.

754
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,295
Once you meet her,

755
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:25,632
it may be harder to understand,
and it may even infuriate you more.

756
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,593
Still,

757
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,346
you should meet her in person.

758
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:38,394
Even if you say no,
I'm always on your side.

759
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,271
I can get revenge for you too.

760
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,481
Like this.

761
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,193
Is that it? That seems a bit too weak.

762
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,861
It's too weak? Then...

763
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,488
Like this.

764
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,620
I'll tell you after I meet her.

765
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,418
Last night, I thought about

766
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,921
why I cried

767
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,465
when I first saw that painting.

768
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,448
Mom, look at this.

769
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,829
Mom, did you see that?

770
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,472
It was happiness

771
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,099
and yearning.

772
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,978
Those were the emotions I felt
when I saw that painting.

773
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,861
I know it could've been
a momentary emotion.

774
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,824
The fact that I was an abandoned child
remains unchanged.

775
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:19,078
Still, I want to move forward now.

776
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,375
I even have a person
who will hold my hand and walk with me,

777
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,176
although it won't be easy,

778
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,517
I'm sure everything will be okay.

779
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,444
Director Gold.

780
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,072
Did you come to see Si-an?

781
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,116
He hasn't come home yet.

782
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,328
I need to show you something.

783
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,460
It's for you, ma'am.

784
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,932
Although fragile,
bubbles symbolize the blooming of hope.

785
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,079
Bubbles symbolize a child's toy.

786
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,416
And someone gazes at those bubbles
with affection.

787
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,309
Si-an told me

788
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,771
that you also like Lee Sol's paintings.

789
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,941
I heard that's why you suggested
that he participate in the exhibition.

790
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,777
Director Gold.

791
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,405
There's a favor I'd like to...

792
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,417
By any chance,

793
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,379
do you remember

794
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,886
the name, Yun-jae?

795
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,280
I'm Yun-jae.

796
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,476
Heo Yun-jae.

797
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,873
And someone gazes at those bubbles
with affection.

798
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,418
These paintings

799
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,713
show a mother's love.

800
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,977
Are you okay? Where are you right now?

801
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,228
Director Gold?

802
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,856
I'm sorry for making you feel
uncomfortable all this time.

803
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:20,940
I'm really sorry.

804
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,901
I guess I was right all along, Ryan.

805
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,862
If it's hard to be here as Heo Yun-jae,

806
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,989
just think that you're here
as the museum director.

807
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:31,242
You can go back
if this is making you feel uncomfortable.

808
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,120
-Yun-jae?
-Why did Duk-mi mention that name?

809
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,705
It's Director Gold's Korean name.

810
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,039
Can you show me

811
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,125
your last painting?

812
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,710
Ms. Lee Sol.

813
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,920
