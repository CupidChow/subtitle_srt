1
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,669
That's going to bad luck.

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,089
Mom, you should read your fortune
at night.

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,091
What kind of fortune-teller works
early in the morning?

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,426
You don't know anything.

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,263
We should do it in the morning
when her head is clear.

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,725
I heard she went on a trip to France

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,769
and was possessed by a French spirit.

8
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,353
The spirit of a duchess.

9
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,903
Since she's a noblewoman,
she cares deeply about clothing.

10
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,488
What was it again?

11
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,489
It was...

12
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,657
Yes, that.

13
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,578
Once she's possessed,
she speaks in French.

14
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,246
-So listen carefully.
-Mom.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,539
-Yes.
-Me?

16
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,333
-Yes.
-French?

17
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,753
French?

18
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,927
Here you go.

19
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,264
Your daughter, the wedding, doubt.

20
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,267
Your daughter's marriage, doubt.

21
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,481
Let's see.

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,776
She has a lot of friends.

23
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,238
Your daughter, very messy.

24
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,699
Your daughter, very naughty.

25
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,829
Did it just say "naughty"?

26
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,705
That's been my wish all my life.

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,334
I can see. I see...

28
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,088
Your daughter's men.
The color of their hair.

29
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,675
The blonde, the blue, the red.

30
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,345
Your daughter's man.

31
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,640
The color of his hair, yellow,
blue, and pink.

32
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,768
What?

33
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:28,982
Your daughter, the foreigner.
She's dating. Song of love.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,655
Your daughter loves a foreigner. Dating.
Luck is coming.

35
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,575
Very good.

36
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,701
Very good.

37
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,246
I'm tired.

38
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,547
We don't even know our daughter's passcode
to her door lock.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,340
Why bring all these side dishes?

40
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,094
The world has changed so much
for the worse.

41
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,762
-It's a trend.
-You startled me.

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,640
I told you to give me a signal
before you talk.

43
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,143
Respecting the privacy of children
is a recent trend.

44
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,812
We are very sophisticated parents.

45
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,151
Goodness. We might never get
to see our child again

46
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,986
if we try to become more sophisticated.

47
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,072
Well, moms who know the passcode
to their children's homes

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,366
all end up working like slaves for them.

49
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,328
Gosh, it's better for me
not to see that home

50
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,871
that's messier than a pigpen.

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,293
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.

52
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,629
I was just really taken aback.

53
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,924
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,928
Are you

55
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,639
angry at me?

56
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,557
Yes.

57
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,607
But...

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,443
I'm also sorry

59
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,572
for entering your house
without permission.

60
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,599
Hyo-jin was watching.

61
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,858
Ms. Sung?

62
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,568
Yes?

63
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,280
-Sung Duk-mi.
-Yes?

64
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,784
Mom!

65
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,832
Is that your mother?

66
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,669
Duk-mi!

67
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,852
I'm proud of you, my little girl.

68
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,812
-Proud of what?
-It's nice to meet you.

69
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,482
-I'm the director of Cheum--
-Do you love Duk-mi?

70
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,109
Mom, what are you saying to Director Gold?

71
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,778
You walked her home

72
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,073
and even kissed her in this open space.

73
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,158
It's not what you think.

74
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,618
You must love her a lot.

75
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,536
No, the things is,

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,164
Ms. Sung and I work together
at the museum.

77
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,374
Did you fall in love
while working together?

78
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,168
No, we didn't fall in love.

79
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,087
-Have you had dinner?
-No, it's...

80
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,339
Dinner?

81
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,884
You shouldn't skip your meals.

82
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,260
Do you have rice at home?

83
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,637
Home? My home?

84
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,263
No, I don't.

85
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,101
We have no choice then. Let's go.

86
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,352
-Sorry?
-Go where?

87
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,270
You said there's no rice at home.

88
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,606
We should at least treat him to dinner.

89
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,609
Mom, there's nothing going on between

90
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,861
-me and--
-Enough said.

91
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,280
Let's go. We have a lot of rice at home

92
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,449
and many side dishes as well.
Let's go then.

93
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,743
Mom, where are you going?

94
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,372
No wonder I suddenly wanted
to cook chicken soup today.

95
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,916
I never imagined running
into you like this.

96
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,794
Do you like hen dish?

97
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,254
Chicken dish?

98
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,340
Sure, I do.

99
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,550
Let's go.

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,052
-Wait, what chicken?
-Ms. Sung.

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,473
Mom. Are you insane?
Listen to me for a second.

102
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,558
Mom!

103
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,676
Ma'am, can I help you with anything?

104
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,428
No, not at all.

105
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,430
You're our guest. Please sit and relax.

106
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,890
Obviously, he feels uncomfortable.

107
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,600
-Mom, we'll just go.
-Honey,

108
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,935
he must feel uncomfortable because of you.

109
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,271
-Go out, and after ten minutes--
-No!

110
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
I feel comfortable.

111
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,942
Just wait a little bit longer.

112
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,122
You must collect viewing stones.

113
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,790
You have a great hobby.

114
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,210
Gosh, it's not a great hobby.

115
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,879
I'm worried that our house might collapse.

116
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,440
In order to fully appreciate the beauty
of its nature,

117
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,900
you must look at it like this.

118
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,527
Do you collect them yourself?

119
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,903
Yes, of course.

120
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,989
I go to all the famous places
when it comes to viewing stones.

121
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,700
-This one is...
-Come and eat.

122
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,497
This one right here portrays the beauty

123
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,998
of landscape scenery.

124
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,376
And of course, how the stone was cut
is very important.

125
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,629
But it's also important to make it
look nice by spraying water on it.

126
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,090
Is he going to speak ten years' worth
of his entire life?

127
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,841
Why is he suddenly so talkative?

128
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,260
Come over already.

129
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,513
And this part is the slope.

130
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,016
This is a stone bottom
along with this on the side.

131
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,603
You need to be able
to use your imagination as you enjoy...

132
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,700
What was your name again?

133
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,285
Ryan...

134
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,037
Ryan Gold, ma'am.

135
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,914
-Are you a foreigner?
-Mom.

136
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,250
Yes.

137
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,879
Your daughter loves a foreigner.

138
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,299
Dating. Luck is coming.

139
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,302
Should I give you some more rice?

140
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,221
I heard it's polite to eat a lot
if someone invites you for a meal.

141
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,723
So I really ate a lot.

142
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,475
-Yes, it was nice to see you eat well.
-Honey.

143
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,733
It was nice to see you enjoy your food.

144
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,489
Mom, we should get going now.

145
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,617
You can't just leave right after you eat.

146
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,368
Yes, she's right.

147
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,204
I have a lot of viewing stones
I want to show you.

148
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,333
I'll show you all sorts
of viewing stones I've collected.

149
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,084
You should have dessert.

150
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,711
It's okay. I don't need dessert.

151
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,838
It's because I want to have dessert.

152
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,632
You guys should wait

153
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,509
in Duk-mi's room and chat a little.

154
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,261
Go where? Mom.

155
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,682
I'll call you once it's ready,
so don't come outside.

156
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,142
Mom.

157
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,608
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,860
It's okay.

159
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,446
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,874
You were always so slow.
But why are you suddenly so quick today?

161
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,084
You're so slow-witted.

162
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,711
Let's give them some time
so they can talk.

163
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,389
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
ART CONTEST

164
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,600
THE GRAND PRIZE

165
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,150
Why did you quit art?

166
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,280
My dad may seem like a rock collector,

167
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,866
but back in the days,
his dream was to be a businessman.

168
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,995
I was getting ready to study abroad.

169
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,874
But he made a huge mistake
and lost our family a lot of money.

170
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,838
My mom told me not to be bothered
and that I should just go,

171
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,840
but I couldn't do that. It was obvious

172
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,342
that my family would split apart
if I went abroad.

173
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,596
So I just gave up.

174
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,184
If I did go abroad back then,

175
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,520
I would've met you as an artist

176
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,105
instead of a curator.

177
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,817
I would've been a really fussy artist
just like Ryan Gold.

178
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,322
Are you okay

179
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,033
even though you can't live as an artist?

180
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,333
I feel better after I cry once in a while.

181
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,545
Every time I feel regretful,

182
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,714
I just get really drunk

183
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,592
and cry a lot.

184
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,552
That makes me feel better.

185
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,264
And once that passes by,
some things make me laugh again.

186
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,185
And that sometimes leads me
to become happy again.

187
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,997
-My gosh.
-Gosh, this is annoying.

188
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,211
Editor Nam? What are you doing here?
You didn't even call.

189
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,505
-Apparently, Duk-mi's home and--
-Duk-mi?

190
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,548
-Duk-mi's home?
-Yes.

191
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,467
Why did she not tell me about it?

192
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,304
But what's the big deal
about her coming home?

193
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,389
She brought home the director
of Cheum Museum.

194
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,892
What? She brought that Lion

195
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,937
-to our house?
-Yes.

196
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,564
Is she crazy?

197
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,031
Move. Yeong-suk, it's me.

198
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,283
Goodness, it would've been nice
if you could stay for longer.

199
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,913
How did you guys come together?

200
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,498
We met downstairs.

201
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,584
-Is your guest leaving already?
-Yes.

202
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,045
I kept him here for way too long.

203
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,214
My goodness, I almost forgot.

204
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,091
Don't go yet. Wait here.

205
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,635
Just a second.

206
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,557
Hello, I'm Nam Se-yeon,
the chief editor of Moment,

207
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,891
the art magazine.

208
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,021
I'm Ryan Gold,
the director of Cheum Museum.

209
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,193
Editor Nam, you must be here
to ask him for an interview.

210
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,530
I've been wanting to visit you
at the museum.

211
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,575
But I heard that you're here,
so I came in a hurry to ask you a favor.

212
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,493
I'm not saying this
because I'm close to her.

213
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,037
But it is one of the few good
art magazines in the country.

214
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,455
You should think about it.

215
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,333
Okay, I'll think about it.

216
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,668
Thank you, Director Gold.

217
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,712
Here you go.

218
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,548
I packed a few side dishes
that you seemed to like earlier.

219
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,383
Thank you.

220
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,386
Thank you for this.

221
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,555
-We'll be off now.
-Okay.

222
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,016
-You too?
-Thank you so much for today.

223
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,935
Director Gold, I hope you visit again.

224
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,233
-I'll give you a call.
-Sure.

225
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,362
Mom, I'm hungry!

226
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,282
What? Didn't you eat?

227
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,410
Yeong-suk, stop feeding him.

228
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,787
Bye.

229
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,831
I hope you visit again.

230
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,263
I'm sorry. I didn't know
my parents would be there.

231
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,390
Didn't you feel uncomfortable?

232
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,394
I ate way too much for me to say
that I felt uncomfortable.

233
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,229
I did notice you eating a lot.

234
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,652
I'd like to apologize once again.

235
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,071
I'm sincerely very sorry.

236
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,198
Okay.

237
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,661
And thank you for today.

238
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,460
Go home safely.

239
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,310
"Director Gold." My gosh.

240
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,521
I'm also a director at my studio.

241
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,140
What are you doing here?

242
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,059
Everyone's waiting at home
to congratulate you.

243
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,229
Congratulate me for what?
I didn't even win the gold medal.

244
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,733
Silver medals don't mean anything now
because you've won so many?

245
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,943
I really thought
I'd win the gold medal this time.

246
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,363
This is all because of my name.

247
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,866
She should've named me Geum-gi
which sounds more like gold.

248
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,952
Geum-gi? That's not a bad name.

249
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,413
I'll call you Nam Geum-gi from now on.

250
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,541
How does it sound? Hey, Nam Geum-gi.

251
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,588
Don't say it with my last name.

252
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,214
It sounds a little weird.

253
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,885
Why? It suits you just fine.
Hey, Nam Geum-gi.

254
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,437
Here.

255
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,859
Are you giving it to me as a gold medal?

256
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,944
It's chocolate. Eat it.

257
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,579
You know what?

258
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,747
Know what?

259
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,886
Are you insane?

260
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,479
As long as you keep bringing medals,

261
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,482
you'll be the best judo athlete I know.

262
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:33,278
You're the coolest and the most talented.

263
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,740
Good job.

264
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,703
Now, Geum-gi, let's grab some dinner.

265
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,497
Come on. Let's eat.

266
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,957
Let's go.

267
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,214
-Nam Geum-gi's favorite meal!
-Stop calling me that.

268
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,344
If you're that sick of your silver medals,
let me sell one.

269
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,637
I need more money for tickets.

270
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,680
-No.
-Why not?

271
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,931
-No way.
-Why not?

272
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,558
-They're mine.
-You're sick of them.

273
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,227
Stop being so cheap.

274
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,062
You said you have a lot of them,
so hand one over.

275
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,779
Be a man and lift it higher.

276
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,412
-We'll be off now.
-Okay.

277
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,831
-You too?
-Thank you so much for today.

278
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,437
My goodness.

279
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,651
What on earth did she pack me?

280
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,252
Freeze the bulgogi

281
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,005
and let it thaw in the fridge
before stir-frying it.

282
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,316
You seemed to enjoy freshly made kimchi,

283
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,692
so I packed a small amount.

284
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,569
Let me know when you run out.

285
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,630
This gwantongseok
is known to help you prosper

286
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,757
and bring you luck.

287
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,636
I wish you the best in everything you do.

288
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,223
I thought it was as heavy as a stone.

289
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,268
Who knew that he had given me one?

290
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,988
Congratulations. You became
a VIP member of The Road to Si-an.

291
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,573
Yes!

292
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,900
What are you doing?

293
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,420
It was his finger, not his lips.

294
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,465
Why were you caught in the moment?

295
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,467
You should've said,
"What do you think you're doing?"

296
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,305
You let your instincts take over
way too easily.

297
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,474
This is so embarrassing.

298
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,051
Hey. What are you still doing up?

299
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,053
I was waiting for you, of course.

300
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,388
Why did you wait?
You're probably exhausted too.

301
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,975
-Do you want some beer?
-Sure.

302
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,194
Did they agree
to let you join the variety show division?

303
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,573
If I successfully wrap up a story,

304
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,200
they'll transfer me.

305
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,368
-Really?
-Yes.

306
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,620
-So what's the story?
-Oh, that.

307
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,379
-Well...
-Don't tell me

308
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,757
-it's about a cult, is it?
-What?

309
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,135
No, of course not.

310
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,470
It's just a story

311
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,557
on those trying very hard in life.

312
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,601
-Good. As long as it's not a cult.
-Right.

313
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,146
-As long as it's not a cult.
-It's just wrong.

314
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,648
No. No cults.

315
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,317
Mom.

316
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,782
Geon-u.

317
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,493
You're in a dream.

318
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,371
You haven't woken up.

319
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,333
Let's go. I am an angel
that only looks like your mom.

320
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,934
His smile couldn't be more vibrant.

321
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,149
His sharp jawline captivated me.

322
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,402
They must be new fans.

323
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,908
"There probably wasn't enough light,
but radial filters were used

324
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,618
to get the maximum out of what they had."

325
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,537
His captured expression
in the form of a medium shot

326
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,123
effectively draws our gaze
to tell the story.

327
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,833
It is truly an impressive photo.

328
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,836
Latte has an eye for photos.

329
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,886
CHEUM MUSEUM OF ART

330
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,810
Latte, thank you.

331
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,896
Compliments and advice are always welcome.

332
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,331
Ms. Kim.

333
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,751
What is it?

334
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,551
Ms. Kim, you're no longer needed
at the museum.

335
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,637
You're fired.

336
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,138
Fired? Why?

337
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,183
Do you want to be sued instead?

338
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,643
You choose between the two.

339
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,562
-What will you sue me for?
-Stalking.

340
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,440
You saw me at Ms. Sung's house last night.

341
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,451
I think you're mistaken.

342
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,581
I found something interesting online.

343
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,375
CUPATCH.

344
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,671
-What's that?
-The work of the one I'll sue.

345
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,589
Why am I the only one you're suing?

346
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,049
Is that a confession?

347
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,595
Why aren't you suing The Road to Si-an?
She also stalked you too.

348
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
You're working with her, aren't you?

349
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,309
I'll sue you both.

350
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,314
I'll delete it then.

351
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,736
I'll be watching.

352
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,200
No way!

353
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,338
WINNERS OF CHA SI-AN'S SIGNING EVENT

354
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,427
-No way.
-My gosh.

355
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,845
Is something wrong?

356
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,806
I won a spot at Si-an's signing event.

357
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,892
Congratulations.

358
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,771
I knew I was going.
I'm talking about The Road to Si-an.

359
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,441
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

360
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,443
I gave up on this signing event
which is why I posted

361
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,612
on social media that I had bought
one copy of the album.

362
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,988
-But you won a spot.
-This is...

363
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,448
Destiny.

364
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,414
I bought a whole box of his albums
to win a spot at the event,

365
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,916
but she got in with a single copy.

366
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,711
She'll probably babble on
about it being fate.

367
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,840
When is that signing event?

368
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,884
Next week on the day the museum closes.

369
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,719
I wouldn't play hooky to attend it.

370
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,644
So The Road to Si-an
will be coming as well.

371
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,194
That duchess fortune-teller
is really impressive.

372
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,489
She said Duk-mi would bring home
some foreign guy,

373
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,116
and she eventually brought Ryan.

374
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,744
We should speak simple English
in case we meet his parents.

375
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,746
-You should study with me.
-Okay.

376
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,338
-This means "our son-in-law."
-Our son-in-law.

377
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,423
Si-an.

378
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,050
Si-an.

379
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,262
-Our son-in-law.
-Our son-in-law.

380
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,892
-Our son-in-law.
-Our son-in-law.

381
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,185
Congratulations, Duk-mi.

382
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,979
It's all thanks to you.

383
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,189
-Our son-in-law.
-Our son-in-law.

384
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,942
Si-an.

385
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,195
-Our son-in-law.
-Our son-in-law.

386
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,407
One, two, three, four,

387
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,493
five, six, seven, eight.

388
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,329
One, two, three, four,

389
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,373
five, six, seven.

390
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,917
One, two, three, good.

391
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,003
Get back up. As you were.

392
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,881
Attention. Bow to Mr. Nam.

393
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,842
GENTLENESS DOMINATES STRENGTH

394
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,554
It's strange.

395
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,683
Before I had a child,
I never liked children.

396
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,895
But my baby is so adorable.

397
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,315
I don't know if I became my kid's fangirl
because of my fangirling experience,

398
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,818
or it's because
I can't be a fangirl anymore.

399
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,946
Seon-ju.

400
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,741
-Why did you get married?
-Because I had Geon-u.

401
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,161
No. I mean how did you
start dating Seung-min?

402
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,329
Instead of an idol star.

403
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,583
I somehow fell for him.

404
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,710
-Although he wasn't an idol star?
-Yes.

405
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,963
When I liked idol stars,

406
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,424
they were my boyfriends,
and when I was dating,

407
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,927
my boyfriend was my idol star.

408
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,847
That was how I felt back then.

409
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,226
Will Duk-mi be like that too?

410
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,728
Will Duk-mi somehow

411
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,815
fall for a guy like that?

412
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,567
-Not an idol star, but--
-You mean Lion?

413
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,529
Does it bother you?

414
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,948
That Duk-mi might like Lion?

415
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,409
What are you talking about?

416
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,871
Kids, you shouldn't fight!

417
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,458
Don't fight.
Don't fight and go play with this!

418
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,586
Eun-gi, you idiot.

419
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,965
You're the most dull-witted person
in the world.

420
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,095
Geon-u.

421
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,598
It's Mom.

422
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,893
I brought some more. Good.

423
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,734
Mr. Kim. From now on,
if you plan to visit here,

424
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,028
please report to me
at least three hours in advance.

425
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,865
I hope you wouldn't barge in like this
without prior notice

426
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,366
ever again.

427
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,622
I'm Eom So-hye.

428
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,333
Do you mean I need permission

429
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,252
to visit my own museum?

430
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,214
Do you confess to the privatization
of this museum then?

431
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,468
How could you say that?

432
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,596
I hate words such as confession,
interrogation, or arrest.

433
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,431
I seriously detest them.

434
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,226
Director Eom, we're in the middle
of a meeting right now.

435
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,272
I'm very busy too.

436
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,817
I have to prepare snacks
for Hyo-jin myself,

437
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,612
and I also have to bring food
for my husband

438
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,031
in prison due to his picky taste.

439
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,575
It's so tiring.

440
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,994
Ms. Sung.

441
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,414
What are you doing next week
when the museum is closed?

442
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,919
Next week is when Si-an is holding
his signing event.

443
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,546
Why do you ask that?

444
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,550
I've made some new friends recently.

445
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,261
It's called W.R.E.O.

446
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,722
It means, Wives of Righteous

447
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,474
Economic Offenders.

448
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,309
W.R.E.O.

449
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,312
They said they would like
to take a quiet and private tour

450
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,897
of our museum.

451
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,650
Ms. Sung, please be the docent
of that tour.

452
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,026
Can you do it?

453
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,741
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,661
Then I'll see you next Monday.

455
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,745
Ms. Sung

456
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,747
doesn't have time on that day.

457
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,417
If they want a quiet tour, tell them
to come in the morning when it opens.

458
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,588
Do you two have a date?

459
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,758
This is why it's bad
to date someone at work.

460
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,177
You're totally messing up the mood.

461
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,929
I'm glad you can read the room.

462
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,140
Think carefully about
who is messing up the mood now.

463
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:00,019
Are you mad? Are you worried
that you won't get to go on a date?

464
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,357
Director Gold has a meeting
with Mr. Cha Si-an that day.

465
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,900
It's a business matter.

466
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:07,986
Really?

467
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,700
I'd like to participate
in various types of work too.

468
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,618
May I participate in that meeting too?

469
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,161
Hyo-jin?

470
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,871
Ms. Kim.

471
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,581
Are you free that day?

472
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,791
Yes.

473
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,669
I'm glad.

474
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,048
Ms. Kim will be the docent
for the private tour then.

475
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,344
For her mother and the members of W.R.E.O.

476
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,596
Director Gold!

477
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,764
Hyo-jin?

478
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,058
Can you be the docent?

479
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,311
That will make me so happy.

480
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,772
You must make me feel proud.

481
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,149
I'm so glad.

482
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,817
-Mom.
-Have a good day then.

483
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,694
-It turns out I have plans that day!
-Bye.

484
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,864
-Mom.
-I feel so happy right now.

485
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,782
She's so hilarious.

486
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,372
Thank you, Director Gold.

487
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,500
Don't worry about it, Ms. Sung.

488
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,343
So, Cha Si-an

489
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,180
has three pieces by Lee Sol.

490
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,724
Next, if we include Mr. Roh Seok,

491
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,226
that will total up to 31 pieces.

492
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,686
Did you measure the sizes?

493
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,440
Director Gold told me to measure the sizes
after signing the contract.

494
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,070
Didn't Director Gold sound
so cool earlier?

495
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,154
Earlier?

496
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,865
-When?
-Earlier.

497
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,451
When he stood up
against Director Eom during the meeting.

498
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,788
Do you find that cool? I'm not sure.

499
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,165
Director Gold and Ms. Sung act like

500
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,958
they're not dating at all usually,

501
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,253
but when he sided with her
at that moment, it looked so cool.

502
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,922
I'm not sure.

503
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,507
What...

504
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,760
What did you just say?

505
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,351
It's not settled yet, but five
to seven collectors will be participating,

506
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,437
and we're expecting
about 50 pieces of artwork.

507
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,897
The most important thing is

508
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,483
categorizing the artwork and deciding
on the concept of the exhibition.

509
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,237
Whether we should categorize them
by collectors or by theme...

510
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,200
You're early. Let's end the meeting here.

511
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,576
Okay, I'll let you two talk.

512
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,412
I'm Choi Da-in.

513
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,706
I didn't introduce myself properly
last time.

514
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,085
I'm Sung Duk-mi of Cheum Museum.

515
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,837
It's nice to meet you.

516
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,682
What about the studio? Did you check well
before making a decision?

517
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,728
Are you dating?

518
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,899
I heard you're dating

519
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,317
Ms. Sung.

520
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,614
Is it true?

521
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,908
I don't think I need to answer that.

522
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,413
You're not denying it.

523
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,960
Let's have dinner next time.

524
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,796
See you.

525
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,549
Hey. Choi Da-in.

526
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,018
I missed you, Ryan.

527
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,313
Choi Da-in. Da-in?

528
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,776
She even has a pretty name.
Mine is Duk-mi.

529
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,450
-Seon-ju.
-Yes.

530
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,079
In America, don't friends exchange hugs
with each other as a greeting?

531
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,289
Not just hugging.

532
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,792
They can rub cheeks with each other
and even kiss as a greeting.

533
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,044
Right?

534
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,183
How could a kiss be a greeting?
That's more special.

535
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,607
Ju-hyeok, why are you wearing that
on your head?

536
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,776
I'm not quite sure why I'm wearing this.

537
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,278
Can you ask my master for me?

538
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,613
Your master?

539
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,325
-Did you make him wear that?
-Doesn't he look so cute?

540
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,083
Ju-hyeok, make yourself a cup of tea
that's good for your throat.

541
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,420
What's gotten into her?

542
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,299
-What?
-You're abusing your power.

543
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,634
-It's fangirling.
-Abuse of power.

544
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,635
It's healthy fangirling.

545
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,512
-Does that look healthy to you?
-Yes.

546
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,888
He looks pale.

547
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,433
-You think?
-I wonder why.

548
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,567
Da-in.

549
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,612
Da-in, come out here.

550
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,953
What do you think?
It's my first artwork in Korea.

551
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,752
So you really are in a slump.

552
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,504
You're too honest with me.

553
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,716
I'd care for you a lot more
if you'd lie to me sometimes.

554
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,386
Where do you even get this stuff?

555
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,849
You're dating someone,
so I had to do something.

556
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,019
It's a gift.

557
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,771
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

558
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,790
EUN-GI

559
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,501
-What's up?
-What are you doing today?

560
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,086
I'm going to Si-an's signing event.

561
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,672
You really don't disappoint me.
He's all you care about, isn't it?

562
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,382
-Fangirling is the best, isn't it?
-Of course.

563
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,846
When I liked the idol stars,
they were my boyfriends,

564
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,933
and when I was dating,
my boyfriend was my idol star.

565
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,062
-Hey, Duk-mi.
-Yes?

566
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,315
Do you want to go see a movie
after the signing event?

567
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,566
After the signing event?

568
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,902
I have so many things to do
after the signing event.

569
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,030
I need to upload the preview,
select photos, and photoshop them.

570
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,283
-I have no time to watch a movie.
-You can photoshop them later.

571
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,036
Editing photos is an act of love.

572
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,747
I need to get it done
right after I take the photos.

573
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,792
Hey, is Cha Si-an more important
than your friend?

574
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,045
You come right after Si-an.

575
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,672
It's dangerous outside,
so stay inside your tent.

576
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,509
-Bye.
-Duk-mi. Hey, Duk-mi.

577
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,958
CHA SI-AN'S SIGNING EVENT

578
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,627

LUCKY DRAW EVENT

00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,321
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

581
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,490
MOM

582
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,494
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

583
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,084
I thought you had a daughter.

584
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,677
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

585
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,639
Si-an!

586
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,812
Si-an!

587
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,190
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

588
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,496
SUCCESSFULLY SENT MESSAGE
TO THE ROAD TO SI-AN

589
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,422
I'm glad you'll be attending
Si-an's signing event.

590
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,925
I'll be waiting
for your amazing photos like always.

591
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,348
Si-an!

592
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,193
I'll make sure to take vivid photos

593
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,695
so you'll feel
as if you're seeing him from up close.

594
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,288
Si-an!

595
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,541
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

596
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,197
Something's definitely fishy.

597
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,283
I'm going to ask
The Road to Si-an herself.

598
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,712
It's Director Gold.

599
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,008
I wonder if his meeting is nearby.

600
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,432
Si-an!

601
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,642
Si-an!

602
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,713
I AM A FANGIRL FOR YOU!

603
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,676
Nice to meet you, everyone!

604
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,722
It's nice to meet you, everyone! Hello!

605
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,100
-Did you wait a long time?
-Yes!

606
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,019
Me too.

607
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,979
Should we call him out, then?

608
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,147
-Yes!
-Yes!

609
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,983
He's the member of the top boyband
in Korea, White Ocean.

610
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,487
Let's welcome Cha Si-an onto the stage!

611
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,614
Come on out!

612
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,407
My gosh.

613
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,871
My goodness. Hello, Si-an.

614
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,207
Hello, Si-an. Oh, gosh.

615
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,460
Your fans are so lucky today.

616
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,754
It's nice to meet you. My goodness.

617
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:38,384
Everyone, do you all want
to hear Si-an's voice?

618
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,426
-Yes!
-Yes!

619
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,305
But before that, you know
we'll be drawing lots today, right?

620
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,473
-Yes!
-Yes!

621
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,476
Yes, that's right.
Si-an will be drawing lots

622
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,936
to pick the winner of the event.

623
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,605
But before we go on,
please say hello to your fans.

624
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,191
Hello, everyone.

625
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,238
It's heart-fluttering
to see my fans up so close.

626
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,074
I hope today's signing event
will become a great memory

627
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,243
for you and me both.

628
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,703
Unfortunately, we need to draw lots

629
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,914
although I'd love to give gifts
to all of you.

630
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,125
-You're our gift!
-Si-an!

631
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,001
Thank you.

632
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,504
Let's start out by picking number three.

633
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,382
Okay, please stand in front of the box.

634
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,468
Now, let's pick out the winners.

635
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,178
Number three!

636
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,142
Number 23.

637
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,561
Where's number 23?

638
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,731
You won a book coupon! Congratulations!

639
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,568
Now, the next gift for the runner-up

640
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,278
is a photo card.

641
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,198
Let's see who will get to win
the photo card.

642
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,536
Number eight.

643
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,165
Number eight! Congratulations!
You won the photo card.

644
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,708
No, you can sit back down.

645
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,752
The third and second winner can come
and get your gifts

646
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,629
after the signing event.

647
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,674
Now, the winner of this event

648
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,886
will get to take a selfie with Si-an!

649
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,182
I even wrote my name for this.

650
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,766
Okay, then.

651
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,101
-Is it the camera
-Who will be

652
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,686
-that's good or the model?
-today's winner?

653
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,729
Let's pick a number.

654
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,319
I didn't hear you. What was that again?

655
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,821
Number 17.

656
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,240
Where's number 17?

657
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,743
Number 17. Number...

658
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,666
He just called number 17. Number 17!

659
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,253
Congratulations!
You'll get to take a selfie with Si-an.

660
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,547
Come on out. Please come to the stage.

661
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,757
Unbelievable.

662
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,759
A selfie?

663
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,768
Come out here.

664
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,978
Come on.

665
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,648
Si-an, please stand next to her.

666
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,617
You should take off the mask
for the selfie.

667
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,619
No?

668
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,208
Wait. Hold on.

669
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,545
Unless you take the photo,

670
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,130
we can't move forward with the event.

671
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,966
-What?
-What's wrong with her?

672
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,509
I'll just do this instead.

673
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,851
That's cool, Si-an.

674
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,708
I'm hanging this up on my wall too.

675
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,003
Congratulations.

676
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,797
Our special gift today is Kong.

677
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,759
Congratulations. There you go.

678
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,346
She's almost in tears.
There's no need to cry.

679
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,056
Congratulations.

680
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,897
What? You took a selfie with Si-an?

681
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,566
Yes. That's what I said.

682
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,991
That fortune-teller must be good.

683
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,494
She was right
about you experiencing love soon.

684
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,039
Is this it for my dating life then?

685
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,875
How dare you say that this isn't enough?

686
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,837
For fangirls, that is dating.

687
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,215
Here's the chocolate mint you ordered.

688
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:48,967
Okay.

689
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:50,886
Thank you.

690
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,436
Send me the preview and I'll upload it.

691
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,688
-All right.
-The Road to Si-an?

692
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,315
What is it?

693
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,819
-Sindy...
-What about her?

694
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,072
She called for me.

695
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,949
The Road to Si-an,
I have something to ask.

696
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,701
Why does she want to talk to you?

697
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,246
The Road to Si-an!

698
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,624
Duk-mi?

699
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,750
Duk-mi!

700
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,169
What now?

701
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,848
The Road to Si-an!

702
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,394
Why is she chasing me?

703
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,188
I just have something to ask.

704
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,780
Wait. The Road to Si-an.

705
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,116
Why is she following me?

706
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,452
-Wait.
-Ms. Kim Hyo-jin!

707
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,958
-Director Gold, over there--
-What are you doing here?

708
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,377
That's not it. Over there...

709
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,382
I lost her because of you!

710
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,384
What? Who did you lose?

711
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:16,346
The Road to Si-an!
Your one-time paparazzo!

712
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,599
Was she The Road to Si-an?

713
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,519
I almost had her.

714
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,248
Gosh, that was close.

715
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,045
Let's get started then.

716
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,131
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN
IN THE UNIVERSE, CHA SI-AN

717
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,707
What am I doing?

718
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,671
Editing photos is an act of love.

719
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,675
Editing photos is an act of love.

720
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,889
What am I going to do?

721
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,868
CHA SI-AN FANPAGE
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

722
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,640
-What's taking her so long?
-I've been waiting all day.

723
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,226
-Did something happen to her?
-Unbelievable.

724
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,103
You bought that many albums?

725
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,647
-I didn't win a spot though.
-No way.

726
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,190
It's why I've been waiting for her.

727
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,318
What if The Road to Si-an didn't go
to the event?

728
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,697
This is a legendary opportunity,
so I'm sure she attended it.

729
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,199
Where's the preview though?
Did something happen to her?

730
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,784
Maybe something went wrong.

731
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,369
-No.
-No way.

732
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,371
The photos today must be legendary.

733
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,000
If not, why would it take her so long?

734
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,837
Where are the photos?

735
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,098
Answer. Please answer.

736
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,237
She isn't posting any photos
or answering the phone.

737
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,994
No. No way.

738
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,804
Could it be what I think it is?

739
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,890
Ms. Sung.

740
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,666
Ms. Sung?

741
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,170
Director Gold, what brings you by?

742
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,215
I wanted to return these.

743
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,346
Oh, no. What do we do?

744
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,850
I should probably wash it off.

745
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,935
Can I use your bathroom?

746
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:14,894
Sure.

747
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,529
No! You can't.

748
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,780
-I can't?
-You can't.

749
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,409
Well, you see,

750
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,369
it's messy.

751
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,621
It's a pigsty in there.

752
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:37,542
I see. Then I should

753
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,420
head home like this.

754
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,264
We probably need to take care of it first

755
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,392
if you're okay with...

756
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,486
-Watch your step.
-Sure.

757
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,112
Come inside slowly.

758
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,407
Watch the door sill. Okay.

759
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,284
This way.

760
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,037
-This way, please come this way.
-Okay.

761
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,455
-Watch out.
-Okay.

762
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,165
Okay, this way.

763
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,337
-This is the bathroom.
-Yes.

764
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,005
No, this way.

765
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,423
-There's another door sill.
-Okay.

766
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,466
-Watch out.
-Okay.

767
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,510
-Okay.
-Ms. Sung.

768
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,261
You're here.

769
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,305
-This is the sink, so wash up.
-Okay.

770
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,307
You must not open your eyes.

771
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,735
The thing is, Ms. Sung...

772
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,697
-Yes?
-Paint doesn't come off with water.

773
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,033
Do you have some acetone?

774
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,162
I do. Please wait in there.

775
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,053
You still have your eyes closed, right?

776
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,347
-You must not open them.
-Okay.

777
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,515
I'm going in.

778
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,895
This may feel uncomfortable,
but it'll just take a second.

779
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,737
All right, follow me now.

780
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,448
This way.

781
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,950
I'll bring you the acetone.

782
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,414
The couch is over here. Come this way.

783
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,540
Ms. Sung.

784
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,795
How messy is your house,
for goodness sake?

785
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,554
You might faint if you see it.

786
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,069
Is it coming off?

787
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,363
Yes, I'm glad it's coming off.

788
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,118
I smelled paint from your room.

789
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,912
Do you still paint these days?

790
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,541
Sometimes.

791
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,216
I always wanted to ask you this.

792
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,425
What is it?

793
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,345
When you couldn't draw

794
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,347
because your arm was broken.

795
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,602
How did you stand it?

796
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,157
I used my left hand.

797
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,325
Left hand?

798
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,619
I'm right-handed.

799
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,873
Since I couldn't use my right hand,
I drew with my left hand.

800
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,668
Were you able to draw
as well as you did with your right hand

801
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,002
using your left hand then?

802
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,674
No. I was terrible at drawing
with my left hand.

803
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,178
But it was fun.

804
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,599
I felt so pressured
that I had to draw well before

805
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,393
so I couldn't enjoy it.

806
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,562
But when I drew with my left hand,

807
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,897
I had so much fun.

808
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,691
It was like scribbling when I was a kid.

809
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,244
There you go.

810
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,331
-Thank you.
-This was my fault anyway.

811
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,127
Come to think of it,

812
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,045
this feels unfair.

813
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:52,839
What is?

814
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,258
You saw my whole house.

815
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,552
But why can't I see yours?

816
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,265
To make things fair, I'll look too.

817
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,017
No!

818
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,748
I feel totally fine.

819
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,713
I must be confident

820
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,885
and be true to my feelings.

821
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,064
I shall choose you.

822
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,448
I will give you the honor

823
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:05,662
to kiss me.

824
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,532
Do you want to keep pretending
that you're dating?

825
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,659
If she does and he refuses,

826
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,661
she might even lose him as a friend.

827
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,622
I want to stay by Ryan and work with him.

828
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,374
I like Ryan.

829
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,668
The thing is, Director Gold...

830
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,294
-I...
-Duk-mi!

831
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,963
Date a guy who you can tell honestly

832
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,424
that you're a fangirl for life.

833
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,384
People might think you're really jealous.

834
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,219
When was I jealous?

835
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,304
I like you.

836
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,140
I really do.

837
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,268
