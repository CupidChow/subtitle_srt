1
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,433
Ms. Sung.

2
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,021
Are you okay?

3
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,817
Wait here.

4
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,370
Who are you?

5
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,289
She is

6
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,500
my girlfriend.

7
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,836
She's my girlfriend!

8
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,801
She is...

9
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,055
Congratulations.

10
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,215
I kept telling him not to park illegally,

11
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,967
but that's become a habit of his.

12
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,262
I see.

13
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,723
She is my girlfriend.

14
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,937
She's my girlfriend!

15
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,652
He's elderly, so I couldn't be
more stern with him.

16
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
Congratulations.

17
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,827
My goodness.

18
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,248
Director Gold.

19
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,333
Are you okay?

20
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,253
Should I get you a condensed milk latte?

21
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,512
Director Gold,

22
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,265
I totally understand.

23
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,935
It was natural for you
to get the wrong idea.

24
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,229
You saw what happened to me
earlier in the afternoon,

25
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,773
and black cars can seem pretty suspicious.

26
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,483
I sometimes get suspicious as well.

27
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,652
And you were

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,489
looking out for your employee,
so it's totally understandable.

29
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,786
Anyway, I'll forget about it.

30
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,080
To be honest, I already did.

31
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm serious.

32
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,169
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes?

33
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,963
-I'll just do it.
-Do what?

34
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,217
I'll be your boyfriend.

35
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,262
Pardon?

36
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,598
You can have me all to yourself
for a while.

37
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,361
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,404
That was really funny.

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,449
It's my first time laughing today.

40
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,454
It wasn't a joke.

41
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,716
Do you like me, Director Gold?

42
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,343
Of course not.

43
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,887
Then why would you want to be
my boyfriend?

44
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,431
Why would I want you to myself?
I don't want you at all.

45
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,100
Don't want me at all?

46
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,727
"For a while."

47
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,397
Did you not hear me say "for a while"?

48
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,570
I'm saying I'll pretend to be
your boyfriend for a short while.

49
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,449
-What?
-Let's pretend like we're dating.

50
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,873
Ms. Sung.

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,167
Yes?

52
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,046
Why don't you sincerely think about
what I said to you earlier?

53
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,090
I know you're doing this
because you're flustered

54
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,010
-and embarrassed about--
-Your personal information

55
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,886
got exposed to everyone
in less than a day.

56
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,223
Information about your family and friends
could be exposed as well.

57
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,058
Are you okay with that?

58
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,686
What if people find out
that you're Si-an's fan

59
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,938
and that you're the fanpage master,
The Road to Si-an?

60
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,481
-I got goosebumps.
-I got goosebumps.

61
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,317
They'll get rid of me
without anyone finding out.

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,901
-Like the morning dew.
-Yes.

63
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,780
-But--
-I was with you at Mr. Cha's place.

64
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,699
And I'm the one who lent you that jacket.

65
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,035
Let's say the agency got confused--

66
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,121
Things got out of hand
because the agency lied to the fans.

67
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,999
I think things will only get worse
if we lie again.

68
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,086
What if everything can be solved
with that one lie?

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,504
But, like what Ms. Yu said,

70
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,840
it'd be way easier
if you just showed everyone

71
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,300
the person that you're actually dating.

72
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,052
But I'm not dating anyone.

73
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,595
Exactly.

74
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,974
Let's say I do lie.

75
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,310
Where am I supposed to
share that information?

76
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,271
If I suddenly upload it
on my social media account, people might

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,148
notice that it's a lie.

78
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,983
I'll think about that a bit more.

79
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,402
You should just decide
if you're going to do it or not.

80
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,362
Bye, then.

81
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,715
BONE AND JOINT HOSPITAL

82
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
You're attracting more attention.

83
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,606
No one will recognize you here.

84
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,195
Who knows?

85
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,781
Some granddaughter who came to visit
her grandma could be Si-an's fan.

86
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,699
Hey.

87
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,036
Your world might revolve around him
since you're his fan.

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,747
But the rest of the world
isn't even interested in him.

89
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,249
They don't even know who he is.

90
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,501
Cha Si-an isn't anyone special.

91
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,303
You might not know Si-an,
but you should know me.

92
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,974
I don't forgive people
who badmouth my baby.

93
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,438
Si-an, that little...

94
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,482
A fake what?

95
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,817
A fake couple.

96
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,403
Maybe things might calm down
if I pretend like I'm dating.

97
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,405
I can't believe you're even willing
to go that far.

98
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,491
Why don't you stop being a fangirl
and actually date someone?

99
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,246
You can't just stop being a fangirl.

100
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,458
Not even a shaman can stop someone
from being a fangirl.

101
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,919
Why would you want to risk your life
to defend an idol star?

102
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,464
That's not what I'm doing. I'm just...

103
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,302
Forget it. Muggles don't need to know.

104
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,430
That little...

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,476
My son is the best.

106
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,769
After you heard that I'm sick,

107
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,355
you brought me to the most famous hospital

108
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,441
so I could receive surgery

109
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,360
from the most famous doctor
in the country.

110
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,533
When that happened,

111
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,870
I told you that you should have a son.

112
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,040
Goodness.

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,917
I'm just speaking the truth.

114
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,252
Why are you taking care
of some other woman's child?

115
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,962
Mother.

116
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,381
I'm the one who did research
and found this hospital.

117
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,219
And I'm the one who booked your surgery.

118
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,472
You shouldn't be thanking your son.
You should be thanking me.

119
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,852
My son, why do you look so exhausted?

120
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,022
You look so worn out.

121
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:47,985
Is she

122
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,529
mistreating you?

123
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,866
You should be grateful
that you have a husband like this.

124
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,703
There are guys who always drink, smoke,
and cheat on you

125
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,331
just because they earn some money at work.

126
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,875
Compared to guys like them,
your husband is 100 times better.

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,087
Earning money isn't the only thing
he's bad at doing.

128
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,341
He can't even do any house chores,
he doesn't know how to smile,

129
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,385
and he's not even funny.

130
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,389
There's not a single good thing
about living with him.

131
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,018
He's good-looking.

132
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,526
See?

133
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,070
Look at how good-looking he is.

134
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,119
Now, that's what you call
"defending someone."

135
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,037
-Grandma.
-Hey.

136
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,789
-I'm here.
-She's incredible.

137
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,167
I brought some fruit. Here.

138
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,796
Let me see. Where does it hurt?

139
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,400
-Who are you?
-I'm the director of Cheum Museum of Art.

140
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,526
Ryan Gold.

141
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,612
Let me ask you a few questions.

142
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,408
Let me tell you one thing.

143
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,827
I really like filing lawsuits,
taking things to court,

144
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,120
and taking legal procedures.

145
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,165
I'm just letting you know
before you write any groundless articles.

146
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,877
Plus, she took the day off today.

147
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,420
So you should just leave.

148
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,467
Is he her boyfriend or something?

149
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,885
Gosh.

150
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,270
-What did he say?
-Tell us.

151
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,446
Cha Si-an's fans and reporters
are in front of the museum.

152
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,698
I said you took the day off,
so don't come to work.

153
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,372
Welcome.

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,001
Ju-hyeok, please give me a cup of coffee.

155
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,337
-With an extra shot?
-Yes, two shots, please.

156
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,465
No, make it three so I can think clearly.

157
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,008
Why?

158
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,259
Did something happen?

159
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,096
My boss just texted me.
He told me not to come to work

160
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,014
because there are reporters
in front of the museum.

161
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,102
It's one thing to have
the fans talk about you.

162
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,647
But it's a whole other story
to have articles written about you.

163
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,151
Should I do an interview and say
I have nothing to do with Si-an?

164
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,029
Hey, it doesn't matter what you say.

165
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,116
The headline will say,
"Cha Si-an's Girlfriend Speaks Out."

166
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,659
Right?

167
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,121
Hey. You need to hide.

168
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,165
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

169
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,709
Three iced Americanos, please.

170
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,839
The reporter said
today's her day off, right?

171
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,590
Can we trust the reporter, though?

172
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,176
I can't trust the reporters
or the articles they write.

173
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762
I wanted to see that woman's face.

174
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,890
According to Sindy's fanpage,
she's quite pretty.

175
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,268
She's still just a middle-aged woman.

176
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,395
By the way, my cousin told me
that she thinks

177
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,188
the curator used to be a fangirl.

178
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,024
She thinks she saw her
at a TVXQ fan club meeting.

179
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,110
There are people
who've never been a fangirl before,

180
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,903
but no one ever stops being a fangirl.

181
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,281
Then are you saying
she could be Si-an's fan?

182
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,533
If she's really Si-an's fan,

183
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,869
I won't forgive her because it means
she betrayed her own kind.

184
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,038
I'll kill her and be rewarded for it.

185
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,167
Can I have my card back?

186
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,138
COMPOSE EMAIL

187
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,352
Sorry I'm late, Director Gold.

188
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,230
I said you could stay home for the day.

189
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,357
Weren't there people outside
waiting for you?

190
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,487
I waited at the coffee shop and came in
when the coast was clear.

191
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,239
I apologize for troubling you.

192
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,909
-I'll avoid the reporters--
-Why not

193
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,536
use them instead?

194
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,413
Use them?

195
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,082
We'll let them spot us together.

196
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,127
We can be seen coming to work together.

197
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,546
Then they'll naturally
publish articles about it.

198
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,716
Yes, of course.

199
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,761
"Was Cha Si-an's girlfriend
cheating on him?"

200
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,095
"Cha Si-an breaks up."

201
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,639
"Was Cha Si-an stabbed in the back?"

202
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,225
And eventually,
my obituary will be published.

203
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,937
Cha Si-an's fans won't believe

204
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,272
anything said by the reporters
or his agency.

205
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,151
They'll probably trust the information
spread among fans.

206
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,030
They trust information spread among fans?

207
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,451
Like believing the words of
Cha Si-an's stalker instead of his agency?

208
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,621
Doesn't that seem more likely?

209
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,041
Then we can play that game as well.

210
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,752
Play that game?

211
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,671
I'll get back to you on that.

212
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,298
Anyway, have you set up
a meeting with Mr. Ahn?

213
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,260
Yes, he said he's free this afternoon.

214
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,844
That's fine with me, too.

215
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,973
I'll get back to you
with a specific time, then.

216
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,610
It seems like no one knows me better
than this person.

217
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,366
The Road to Si-an must be a special fan.

218
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,119
Fans who take photos of celebrities
and upload them online

219
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,495
are called fanpage masters.

220
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,748
She's not just special to me
but to my other fans, too.

221
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:39,003
One time, a rumor spread about
the members of our group

222
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,462
getting into a fight after a show.

223
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,339
It also said we would disband.

224
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,759
However, The Road to Si-an
collected all the photos

225
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,344
taken by the fanpage masters

226
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,514
and proved that we were smiling
and didn't even have time to argue.

227
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,434
She was able to reassure the fans.

228
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,812
Ever since that incident,
the fans trust The Road to Si-an.

229
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,523
She seems better at taking care of things
than our agency.

230
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,490
4TH, SEOUL MUSIC AWARDS TICKETING
6TH, FLIGHT TO HONG KONG FROM TAIWAN

231
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,221
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

232
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,974
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

233
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,810
Director Gold.

234
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,481
CHEUM MUSEUM OF ART

235
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,526
FOLLOW

236
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,488
RYAN GOLD IS NOW A FOLLOWER

237
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,245
Ms. Sung?

238
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,667
RYAN GOLD

239
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,168
IS NOW

240
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,379
A FOLLOWER

241
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,093
What's wrong?

242
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,763
Did they track your phone too?

243
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,014
No!

244
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,308
It's nothing.

245
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,408
RYAN GOLD IS NOW A FOLLOWER

246
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,996
Like believing the words of
Cha Si-an's stalker instead of his agency?

247
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,165
Then we can play that game as well.

248
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,257
No way.

249
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,804
I'm sorry I didn't come
to meet you sooner.

250
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,974
You were probably busy
adjusting as the new director.

251
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,519
I should have thought it over
before causing you more trouble.

252
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,774
Ms. Sung, I'm sure
I made it hard for you, too.

253
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,359
Please don't say that.

254
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,737
My lack of judgment
is what caused you trouble.

255
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,363
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,701
Just like Ms. Sung said,
the fifth-anniversary exhibition...

257
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,996
We don't need
to discuss that matter anymore.

258
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,290
I should not have gotten greedy.

259
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,959
With all due respect,

260
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,919
I'd like you to be

261
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,629
even more ambitious.

262
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,138
It's a proposal for an exhibition
at New York's Mono Art Gallery.

263
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,766
The Mono Art Gallery in New York?

264
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,769
I wanted you to hold
a solo exhibition in New York,

265
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,229
and now I finally got that chance.

266
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,732
-At this age?
-You're at a perfect age

267
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,108
to head overseas.

268
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,818
Congratulations, sir.

269
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,572
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Sung.

270
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,240
Thank you.

271
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,169
I've always wanted
to show his art overseas.

272
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,922
I felt bad since it took him a while
to get recognized.

273
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,635
No one is as well-acquainted
with his artwork than myself.

274
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,596
If you let me prepare the exhibition,
I'll make sure it goes smoothly.

275
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,473
Sure.

276
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,142
I'll connect you to the curator
at Mono Art Gallery.

277
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,560
All right.

278
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,320
Director Gold.

279
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,243
What ideas did you have in mind?

280
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,411
You said something about
playing the same game.

281
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,958
You're probably not aware of this,
but there are people

282
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,377
who are called fanpage masters.

283
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,505
-Fanpage master?
-They take photos of celebrities

284
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,965
and post them online.

285
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,717
So they're also famous among fans.

286
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,054
-And?
-I have something to return

287
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,973
to Cha Si-an's fanpage master.

288
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,601
I was thinking of asking her a favor
when I contact her.

289
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,813
The fanpage master's words
will be more believable

290
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,982
to Cha Si-an's fans.

291
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,070
But do you think
that person will agree to do it?

292
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,530
I don't think she will.

293
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,450
She owes me, actually.

294
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,329
If she agrees to do it,
will you be on board?

295
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
No!

296
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,213
I'm not one to lie, you see.

297
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,133
-Ms. Sung.
-Even though it'd take a while,

298
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,678
I'll just wait for the rumors
to quiet down. Well, then.

299
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,392
Let's go.

300
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,397
-Have you called a cab?
-Yes.

301
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,107
-Is that him?
-Si-an!

302
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,035
Si-an! Please tell me

303
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,412
that the rumor isn't true.

304
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,914
What?

305
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,750
Are you insane?

306
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,085
-Si-an.
-Si-an!

307
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,550
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

308
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,093
-Si-an.
-Wait!

309
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,348
-No, don't go!
-Wait!

310
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,185
Couldn't you be gentler?
She's still a fan of mine.

311
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,395
It's just that she...

312
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,274
You must be exhausted. Get some rest.

313
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,487
What's with the mad driving?

314
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,489
-A cab is on our tail.
-A cab?

315
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,168
-Si-an!
-Si-an!

316
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,837
-Over here.
-Si-an! You're so handsome.

317
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,298
-Si-an!
-I love you!

318
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,926
-Hey!
-Si-an!

319
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,848
Si-an!

320
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,278
Is Si-an in there?

321
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,947
-Sian.
-He's going.

322
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,708
Good job, Si-an.
Go home and get some rest.

323
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,967
Hey, what was that?

324
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,011
Good job.

325
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,806
A van Cha Si-an of White Ocean
was riding in

326
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,934
hit a woman in her 20s who was his fan.

327
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,646
According to Gangnam Police Station,
around 10 p.m. on the 18th,

328
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,815
in a parking lot located in Seocho-gu,

329
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,068
a van Cha Si-an was riding in

330
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,946
hit a woman in her 20s known as Ms. Kim.

331
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,489
Cha Si-an was...

332
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,659
Honey.

333
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,703
We haven't seen each other for three days.

334
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,456
Don't tell me you're going to
leave me to go see Duk-mi.

335
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,334
Honey, take your time eating
and take Geon-u home.

336
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,544
Geon-u, eat all of your kimchi.

337
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,212
Make him eat kimchi, okay?

338
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,009
She left.

339
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,429
Of course, she should go.

340
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,890
She's the only friend she has left.

341
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,227
Does she have two husbands or what?

342
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,563
It seems like she jumped
in front of Cha Si-an' van.

343
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,024
The police are investigating
the details of the accident.

344
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,526
Duk-mi.

345
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,073
-Duk-mi.
-Seon-ju.

346
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,240
Si-an...

347
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,827
Si-an and the victim haven't been
hurt badly. It will be okay.

348
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,371
This accident happened because of me.
It's all my fault.

349
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,956
Why is this your fault?

350
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,042
It's just because of obsessive fangirling.

351
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,961
The fan who jumped in front of his van
wasn't an obsessive fan.

352
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,546
It's the opposite of that.

353
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,257
She was just an ordinary fan
who cheered for him at home.

354
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,801
How do you know that?

355
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,905
What's the truth about Si-an's scandal
posted on Sindy's fanpage?

356
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,366
His agency isn't saying anything else.

357
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,701
I want to ask Si-an myself.

358
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,372
I'm so frustrated and depressed,
I just want to die.

359
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,086
After that, she kept commenting that
she was waiting near his agency

360
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,964
or his house, but stopped
posting after the accident.

361
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,341
If she gets a mental breakdown
from a petty scandal like this,

362
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,135
how can she even be a fangirl?

363
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,846
I was mistaken.

364
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,891
This won't be solved just by
waiting for time to pass by.

365
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,476
What will you do, then?

366
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,246
Lion was right.

367
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,039
All it takes is one lie.

368
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,084
Ms. Yu, when will you complete
the list of celebrities participating

369
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,169
in the special exhibition?

370
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,046
I have to double-check some people,
so I'll have it ready by tomorrow.

371
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,008
Do you think Cha Si-an
will be able to participate?

372
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,634
With his accident and all.

373
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,137
I will contact Cha Si-an.

374
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,849
Mr. Kim, check if we can store
the artworks in the storage room.

375
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,393
Ms. Sung.

376
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,650
Ms. Sung?

377
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,862
Yes.

378
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,537
Why don't you and I select
the first pieces for Mr. Ahn's exhibition?

379
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,080
Okay.

380
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,763
Director Gold.

381
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,017
Is something wrong?

382
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,061
You seemed distracted during the meeting.

383
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:25,398
I'm sorry. I actually wanted
to talk about Cha Si-an.

384
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,861
You know, about pretending
that we're dating...

385
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,864
I thought maybe we should give it a try.

386
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,826
I thought about it again,
and hoping time will take care of it

387
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,203
seems a bit irresponsible.

388
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,957
Cha Si-an's accident yesterday
keeps bothering me, too.

389
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,503
Okay, let's do it then.

390
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,757
So what are you thinking of
doing specifically?

391
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,303
I'm going to ask the fanpage master

392
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,681
I mentioned last time to interview us.

393
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,141
An interview?

394
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,477
-He wants to meet with The Road to Si-an?
-Yes.

395
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,398
He has the wrong idea about
fanpage masters.

396
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,233
Where should we begin teaching him?

397
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,318
I barely stopped myself
from blowing my cover.

398
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,405
Why do you keep laughing?

399
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,990
What will you do?

400
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,825
I have a plan.

401
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,217
THE ROAD TO SI-AN IS NOW A FOLLOWER

402
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,935
Howdy, there!

403
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,895
Howdy?

404
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,231
-Why? Does it sound strange?
-What are you doing?

405
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,985
I have to sound the opposite
of my intelligent and graceful self,

406
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,695
so he doesn't know it's me.
Don't you think so?

407
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,866
He won't notice
even if you just act like yourself.

408
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,535
Really? All right.

409
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,499
MESSAGE TO RYAN GOLD

410
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:18,094
RYAN GOLD

411
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:42,202
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

412
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,089
Are you The Road to Si-an?

413
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,975
I am Ryan Gold,
the director of Cheum Museum of Art.

414
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,647
I don't know if you remember,
but we met at the airport before.

415
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,191
You fell off a ladder

416
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,485
trying to take a picture, right?

417
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,948
Oh, you were the one lying beneath me?

418
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,745
Yes, that air mat was me.

419
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,874
I'm very sorry about that.

420
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,918
I'm not here to receive your apology.

421
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,131
I contacted you
because I have your notebook.

422
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,218
Oh, my. So you were the one who had that.

423
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,513
I'd be grateful if you give that back.

424
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,018
So...

425
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,647
Is that all you have to say to me?

426
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,028
Well...

427
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,700
Did you say Cheum Museum of Art?

428
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,910
Isn't that the place where that woman

429
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,872
who got caught in the scandal
with Si-an works at?

430
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,462
Actually, that's why I contacted you.

431
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,756
Why?

432
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,674
That curator

433
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,676
is my girlfriend.

434
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,969
Goodness.

435
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,387
He sounds so tough.

436
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,222
This is so exciting.

437
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,183
What else? What did Lion say?

438
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,395
So,

439
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,774
you want me to post your interview

440
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,359
and photos of you as a couple
on my fanpage?

441
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,987
Yes.

442
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,866
Under the circumstances,
I can't meet you myself.

443
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,203
There is another way, though.

444
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,456
Will you trust me?

445
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,880
Ms. Sung.

446
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,466
We need another accomplice.

447
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,470
Someone who will take pictures
of a fake couple's fake date.

448
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,347
A fake paparazzi.

449
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,810
Yes. I know someone
who is perfect for that job.

450
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,527
CLOSED

451
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,615
Director Gold.

452
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,077
Hello, Mr. Gold.
It's my first time seeing you here.

453
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,621
Ms. Sung?

454
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,872
Yes?

455
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,167
Can we talk for a moment?

456
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,211
Me?

457
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,176
She was the perfect person
you were talking about?

458
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,137
She's quite talented in taking pictures.

459
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,685
Pictures of you and I
pretending to be a couple?

460
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,853
Yes.

461
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,365
Her?

462
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,575
Yes.

463
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,502
I understand...

464
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,673
Well,

465
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,593
I guess it might be better
to see for herself.

466
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,595
-Pardon?
-No, it's nothing.

467
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,763
I did some research on paparazzi photos.

468
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,473
I thought it might help.

469
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,313
Stuff like this.

470
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,441
-Or stuff like this.
-Seon-ju.

471
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,612
This is the least you should do.
You guys are both over 30.

472
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,280
Don't you agree, Director Gold?

473
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,240
Let's just say we're a very careful couple

474
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,076
who are dating in secret at work.

475
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,165
-Are you crazy?
-What?

476
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,167
-Could you do this if it were you?
-Yes.

477
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,298
Don't look here.

478
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,740
I can't tell if you're her boyfriend
or her boss who's scolding her.

479
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,785
Why? We look like a couple from the way
we're drinking coffee together.

480
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,205
If drinking coffee together
makes you a couple,

481
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,291
I should have
thousands of lovers right now.

482
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,171
Then what would you do

483
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,923
with your real lover?

484
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,299
Me?

485
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,355
Seon-ju, who does this at work?

486
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,191
There's nothing a couple can't do.

487
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,944
Real couples who date at work
do things that are even worse.

488
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,570
I heard they act like animals in a zoo.

489
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,156
This is an art museum.

490
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,159
Art is the result of desire.

491
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,996
Show me your acting
that portrays your desires.

492
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,622
It's just acting.

493
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:30,216
Duk-mi, you have to look
like you really want to have him.

494
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,093
How am I supposed to do that?

495
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,806
Why don't we just do it properly?

496
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,310
Are you serious?

497
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,231
Yes.

498
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,633
Director Gold, you're too stiff.
Can you seem more natural?

499
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,558
My goodness.

500
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,143
Does your friend

501
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,064
normally enjoy stuff like this?

502
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,690
What do you mean?

503
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,401
Does she enjoy seeing you
with someone else

504
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,532
or being physically affectionate
with another person?

505
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,579
She goes crazy over that.

506
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,375
She likes it when that happens.

507
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,170
She's very much interested in whom I meet

508
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,588
and what I do with them.

509
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,841
But she always tells me
not to get married.

510
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,012
Are you okay with that?

511
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,557
Doesn't that bother you?

512
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,893
I'm not exactly happy about it,
but what would I even say?

513
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,062
Why are you letting her do that to you?

514
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,944
She's really rich.

515
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,832
You guys look amazing together.

516
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,625
It's making my heart flutter.

517
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,046
I think we've done enough.

518
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,765
It's Ms. Sung's private life.

519
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,352
It's none of my business.

520
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,229
It's nothing I should be concerned about.

521
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,325
Your makeup looks amazing today.

522
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,576
-Really?
-You look pretty.

523
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,829
Director Gold, let's get going.

524
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,540
Where?

525
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,958
I thought we were done.

526
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,294
Director Gold, haven't you ever
dated anyone before?

527
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,255
If we're going to do this,
we should do a proper job.

528
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,305
One!

529
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,724
Two!

530
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:07,808
What is this?

531
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,977
Choikang Judo!

532
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,979
What are you doing? Do it properly.

533
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,731
-Okay.
-Geon-u.

534
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,107
Yes, Mr. Nom!

535
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,113
It's not "Mr. Nom." Repeat after me.
It's "Mr. Nam."

536
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,782
Mr. Nom.

537
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,951
-"Nam."
-Nam.

538
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,119
Yes, great job. "Mr. Nam."

539
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,788
Mr. Nom.

540
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,749
Forget it.

541
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,668
But what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be home?

542
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,835
Your mom must be waiting.

543
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,881
My mom told me to play with you
because she's busy.

544
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,466
Play?

545
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,929
I thought I made it clear
that I'm not his nanny.

546
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,057
Why is your mom busy?

547
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,934
My mom went on a date.

548
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,812
What? She went on a what?

549
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,313
A date.

550
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,691
A date?

551
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,823
I'll explain what's going to happen.

552
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,367
It's simple. You guys should
really act like you're on a date.

553
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,245
And I'll secretly take photos of you
like a real paparazzi.

554
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,539
So don't try to find me

555
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,790
even if you can't see me.

556
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,417
Is this really necessary?

557
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,003
Director Gold, haven't you ever
dated anyone before?

558
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,255
I have.

559
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,215
I've been on a lot of dates.

560
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,800
Exactly.

561
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,678
You just need to use
that experience of yours.

562
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,723
Let's get going.

563
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,323
Do you really call this a date?
Is this what you call a date?

564
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,950
What? What's wrong with this?

565
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,494
You guys look like a couple
that's been married for 40 years.

566
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,829
And it looks like you're going home

567
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,290
after eating out
because you didn't want to cook at home.

568
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,500
And you guys fought while eating.

569
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,669
You're so detailed.

570
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,171
You guys are on a date.

571
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,259
-You should be like that.
-Hey.

572
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,803
Or how about that?

573
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,351
Hey, are you crazy?
Don't be so meticulous.

574
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,727
How can I not be meticulous?

575
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,395
We have to fool thousands of people.

576
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,397
You should at least hold hands.

577
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,033
I hope we get along well.

578
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,285
I memorized your names, so that's enough.

579
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,426
If you don't want to hold hands,

580
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,595
we can just walk a little bit closer
to each other.

581
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,435
I'm the one who suggested this,
so let's do a proper job.

582
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,476
Okay, nice.

583
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,688
A date?

584
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,481
-One!
-A date?

585
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,653
Two!

586
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,449
Two!

587
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,201
I know they're fangirls,
but they should have a conscience.

588
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,370
How could they sacrifice
their lives like this?

589
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,290
She's not even answering.

590
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,375
-Two!
-She's unbelievable.

591
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,334
One!

592
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,921
Why isn't she picking up?

593
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,298
One!

594
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,343
Two!

595
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,848
-Geon-u!
-Yes, Mr. Nom!

596
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,018
Hey, can you give me your cell phone?

597
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,853
Two!

598
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,357
One!

599
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,068
Good. Go on.

600
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,322
Good job. Once more.

601
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,091
That looks natural.

602
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,229
GEON-U: HELP ME
MESSAGE SENT FROM CHOIKANG JUDO

603
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,690
Geon-u?

604
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,860
MY SON

605
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,321
Wait. What's going on?

606
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,742
Duk-mi...

607
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,036
Oh, no.

608
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,913
What do I do?

609
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,749
Darn it.

610
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,795
Geon-u.

611
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,130
Are you all right?
How did you hurt yourself?

612
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,549
I'm not hurt.

613
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,717
-Where is Duk-mi?
-You texted me.

614
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,220
It was Mr. Nom.

615
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,729
You sent it? Why?

616
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,358
You and Duk-mi didn't answer your phone.
So I used your son's phone.

617
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,194
What about Duk-mi? Why did you come alone?

618
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,823
Why are you desperately asking for her?

619
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,366
It's not like you have feelings for her.

620
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,161
As if. I just think
it's pathetic, that's all.

621
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,247
She's insane, isn't she?

622
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,208
How can she date some guy
to keep a celebrity's reputation?

623
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,544
If not some guy,
who is she supposed to date?

624
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,173
You're just as bad.
You should've talked her out of it.

625
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,633
Wait.

626
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,968
Hold on.

627
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,219
Did you make

628
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,346
a prank call to a mom

629
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,850
regarding her child's safety?

630
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,312
-How dare you.
-Ma'am.

631
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,314
Your son is watching.

632
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,735
-Geon-u, close your eyes.
-No, don't.

633
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,784
We'll deal with this later.

634
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,202
Geon-u, let's go.

635
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,079
So where is Duk-mi?
What is she doing right now?

636
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,000
Why don't you go and get changed?

637
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,377
Eun-gi.

638
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,713
You like Duk-mi, don't you?

639
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,922
Hey.

640
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,009
How can you say that?

641
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,179
I'm just a concerned brother who--

642
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,388
That's utter nonsense.

643
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,892
How can you be siblings
when you're not blood-related?

644
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,269
You listen up.

645
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,854
Men who aren't blood-related

646
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,981
fall into one of these categories
for women.

647
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,485
Men you want to be careful around and
men you don't want to be careful around.

648
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,781
If you wish to be either one of those,

649
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,825
stop this nonsense about being siblings.

650
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,704
Aren't you way past the age
to be playing house?

651
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,213
Don't point at me.

652
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,843
What on earth is she talking about?

653
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,228
You should have said you were going home.

654
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,687
What?

655
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,691
I see. Is Geon-u all right, then?

656
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,486
Okay. I'll call you later.

657
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,779
Sure.

658
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,159
Director Gold,

659
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,663
something came up
and Seon-ju had to head home.

660
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,582
-What about the photos?
-She took enough.

661
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,211
-We should go, then.
-Sure.

662
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,591
I see a lot of children here.

663
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,261
It's one of the best places to bring them.

664
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,514
Did you come here
when you were little, too?

665
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:30,018
Of course. Everyone who lives
in and near Seoul probably did.

666
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,276
Director Gold.

667
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,114
Would you like to stay a while longer?

668
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,119
I haven't been
to an amusement park in a while,

669
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,290
and you haven't been anywhere in Korea
apart from your house and the museum.

670
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,875
And the hospital.

671
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,049
Also, there might be Cha Si-an's fan

672
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,719
among those girls over there.

673
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,972
Think of it as creating witnesses.

674
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,768
Then let's get ourselves
as many witnesses as we can.

675
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,958
It was in selfie mode.

676
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,795
-Director Gold.
-Why are you taking my photo?

677
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,672
Director Gold, please smile.

678
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,883
Make a cool pose.

679
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,886
-Enjoy your selfies.
-It's a great place to take them.

680
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,013
Just do it already.

681
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,029
Enjoy.

682
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,700
-Did I get it off me?
-Yes.

683
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,579
Wait, look at this.

684
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,749
You should probably get this off first.

685
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,964
A lion!

686
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,802
A lion, like you.

687
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,305
Gosh, it's adorable.

688
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,266
Come this way.

689
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,852
Sit.

690
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,356
-Say, "lion"!
-My name's Ryan.

691
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,316
Say "lion"! Make a V!

692
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,695
Lion, smile!

693
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,573
No, smile like you're happy.

694
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,367
Can you take one of me, too?

695
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,396
I'm sorry.

696
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,820
It brought me back to my days in school.

697
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,406
I'm embarrassed to say this
in front of you,

698
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:32,743
but I used to be quite the hotshot

699
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,161
in school drawing contests.

700
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,209
Anyway, back then,
I thought I'd go to art school

701
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,962
and become an artist.

702
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,008
I had to give up when I broke my wrist
in my senior year, though.

703
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,845
I studied an extra year because of that.

704
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:57,225
My doctor scared me by saying
I might not regain function in my wrist.

705
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,435
It was terrifying.

706
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,105
Because you might
not be able to draw again?

707
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,732
Yes.

708
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,862
But now that I think of it,
the incident helped me in some ways.

709
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,572
How so?

710
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,492
My desire then

711
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,704
wasn't to go to an art school
and become a famous artist.

712
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,123
All I wanted

713
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,877
was to be able to draw again.

714
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,215
See?

715
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,094
I'm no artist,
but my drawing isn't hideous.

716
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,523
-My name isn't Lion, it's--
-That's a gift.

717
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:57,411
SPRING, 2019

718
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,963
Next.

719
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,762
How can you be siblings
when you're not blood-related?

720
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,015
Next.

721
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,227
Stop this nonsense about being siblings.

722
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,771
Next.

723
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,110
Eun-gi. You like Duk-mi, don't you?

724
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,074
Mr. Nam.

725
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,370
You're the first man who has
pummeled me to the ground like this.

726
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,084
Did you hurt your head or what?

727
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,449
Mom.

728
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,040
Director Gold, shall we go now?

729
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,125
Yes.

730
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,298
Dad.

731
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,930
You lost your dad?

732
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,101
-What is your name?
-Min-ho.

733
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,604
-Min-ho, grab my hand...
-Do you want to go with me

734
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,815
to find your dad?

735
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,156
It's so hot.

736
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,496
This way, let's go!

737
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,747
Give it to me.

738
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,209
Give it.

739
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,341
You can try now.

740
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,849
Director Gold, over here.

741
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,196
I lost him around here.

742
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,073
-The playground?
-Yes.

743
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,619
Min-ho!

744
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,912
Dad!

745
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:31,499
Are you okay? I was worried sick.

746
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,879
You're not hurt, are you?

747
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,047
Let me see.

748
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,299
I told you to always stay close to me.

749
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,107
Director Gold.

750
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,945
Didn't you hate holding hands?

751
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,325
I didn't want to let go of
that kid's hand, though.

752
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,326
Why?

753
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,994
It reminded me of when I was a kid.

754
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,289
It's not that I don't like holding hands.

755
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,250
I don't like the moment
when I have to let it go again.

756
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,253
That warm feeling disappears

757
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,714
and it feels like
I'm the only one left in this world.

758
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,257
Then,

759
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,969
you don't hold hands with anyone at all?

760
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,141
I really like holding hands.

761
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,062
Seon-ju told me it gets worse
when I'm drunk.

762
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,855
A drinking habit?

763
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,192
So...

764
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,071
If you ever

765
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,532
want to hold someone's hand,

766
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,451
or if you don't want to let go,

767
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,912
I'll let you borrow my hand.

768
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,759
It's so pretty. Oh, my!

769
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,199
I guess I've borrowed enough for today.

770
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,077
All right.

771
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,814
Thank you for giving me a ride home.

772
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,777
Of course. You're my girlfriend.

773
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,199
I had fun today.

774
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,409
Although it was a fake date.

775
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,288
I hope it all works out.

776
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,292
I will send our pictures to
the fanpage master.

777
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,962
Okay.

778
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,339
I'll be going now.

779
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,965
I'll see you tomorrow.

780
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,062
I feel so guilty.

781
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,904
Oh my gosh.

782
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,698
Why are you so startled?
Did you do something wrong?

783
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,409
What are you talking about?

784
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,079
My life is a mess because of the sins
I committed in my previous life.

785
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,040
In this life, I'm only going to
do good deeds and achieve true happiness.

786
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,000
Why is it Lion?

787
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,089
What?

788
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,467
If it's fake anyway, it could be anyone.

789
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,304
Why does it have to be that director?

790
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,099
It could have been me.

791
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,814
-You need money, don't you?
-What?

792
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,232
It would have the perfect chance

793
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,359
to act like my fake boyfriend
and blackmail me for money.

794
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,069
What do you take me for?

795
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,238
Here, take it.

796
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,240
This is all I have right now.

797
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,284
I'll give you more
when I receive my paycheck.

798
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:38,788
-It's not that.
-Editor Nam is going through a tough time.

799
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,332
It's hard to make money
through art magazines now.

800
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,210
You might not get that money you lent her.

801
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,005
I didn't lend it to her.

802
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,383
-I just gave it to her.
-Gosh, what a loyal son.

803
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,179
Anyway, if you need money, ask me.
Only small amounts, though.

804
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,889
Ask Seon-ju for larger amounts.

805
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,101
If you need money, just tell me.
Stop beating around the bush.

806
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,686
We're family, you know.

807
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,771
-We're not.
-I wish we weren't.

808
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,816
Who'd believe it
if we say that we're a couple?

809
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,653
You're not helpful at all, are you?

810
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,071
See you.

811
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,498
Hello, The Road to Si-an.

812
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,293
I'm attaching the pictures taken
according to what we discussed.

813
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,589
Thank you again for doing this
difficult favor for us.

814
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,927
P.S., I'm attaching a picture of proof.

815
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,553
A picture of proof?

816
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,724
This is perfect.

817
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,018
Shall I begin, then?

818
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,368
Gosh, what is up with my face?

819
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,039
I'm so naive.

820
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,792
My desires are so naive.

821
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,128
Gosh, I feel so hot.

822
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,728
I thought that jacket
was the only one in Korea.

823
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,688
Sindy was a huge liar.

824
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,691
We've been branded as obsessive fans
because of Sindy.

825
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,984
Can you believe this?

826
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,114
The Road to Si-an is taking care of
the total mess Sindy made.

827
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,033
Darn it!

828
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,499
If they're dating,

829
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,544
why did he let her go home alone?

830
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,521
Who is it?

831
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:33,981
Who is it?

832
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,212
Mr. Cha.

833
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,815
Are you up?

834
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,868
You should drink some water.
I'm sure you're thirsty.

835
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,871
How did I end up here?

836
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,247
How?

837
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,291
I just saw you

838
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,128
coming from over there to here.

839
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,213
You were practically swimming.

840
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,169
You took off your clothes yourself,

841
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,713
and I covered you with a blanket
to keep you warm.

842
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,173
Do you have any other questions?

843
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,133
No.

844
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,678
Good thinking. You should get dressed.
I need to go to work.

845
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,430
Okay.

846
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,113
By the way,

847
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,698
can you

848
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,700
keep this a secret?

849
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,994
Ryan.

850
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,288
Your cast

851
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,624
was on your right arm.

852
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,712
Bye.

853
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,351
Why did you do that?

854
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,311
You idiot!

855
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,245
Ms. Sung.

856
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:39,041
Do you know how Eskimos
control their anger?

857
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,751
Eskimos?

858
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,086
Yes.

859
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:46,299
When Eskimos get angry,

860
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,301
they walk

861
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,553
until they're no longer angry.

862
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,974
And they mark where they stop

863
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,019
with a stick and walk back.

864
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,646
That's how they find peace again.

865
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,444
Ms. Sung, I'm sure you got
really angry that day

866
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:08,112
because I suddenly slapped you
out of nowhere.

867
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,991
-Well, yes. That day--
-But,

868
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,077
I trust that you're someone

869
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:18,789
who can wisely control your anger
just like the Eskimos.

870
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,208
What do you say?

871
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,919
Was this enough

872
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,420
to calm you down?

873
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,765
You can use flowers instead of a stick.

874
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,149
Mr. Kim.

875
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,404
As a means to apologize?

876
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,075
Ms. Sung.

877
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,285
We reactivated
the online bulletin board today,

878
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,787
and it's completely clean again.

879
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,413
We didn't even get a single phone call.

880
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,041
You really had to go through a lot
because of me. Thank you.

881
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,505
Now that everything's over,
you can go back to focusing on work.

882
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,548
How could things change overnight?

883
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,217
Well, the thing is...

884
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,771
Sindy?

885
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,023
She's our intern.

886
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,566
-Intern?
-Yes.

887
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,319
We asked for additional staff,
and Director Gold must've hired her.

888
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,405
Hello.

889
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,449
My name is Kim Hyo-jin,
and I'll be working here as an intern

890
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,826
starting from today.

891
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,414
I can't wait to see and learn
new things at Cheum Museum of Art.

892
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,001
I look forward to working with you.

893
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,837
What is she trying to see and learn?

894
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,886
To be honest,

895
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,056
there's something I haven't told you guys.

896
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,436
I'm dating Director Gold.

897
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,231
What did you just say?

898
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,736
He's my boyfriend.

899
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,946
-What?
-What?

900
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,741
Stop joking around.

901
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,409
That's absurd.

902
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,454
Honey.

903
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,803
I'M SORRY

904
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:40,639
Oh, gosh.

905
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,745
I guess no one knew
that you guys were dating.

906
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,331
I'm going to set things straight
by telling everyone the truth.

907
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,708
Mr. Nam, I would like to learn judo.

908
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,378
What's your deal?
Why do you have the urge to fight me?

909
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,130
Do you like it?

910
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,507
I'm more grateful than you think.

911
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,217
If he did something
to take responsibility for,

912
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,426
he should be responsible until the end.

913
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,387
No matter how embarrassing it is,

914
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,431
Something's fishy.
I'm going to find out no matter what.

915
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,101
The Road to Si-an isn't someone
who would take those kinds of photos.

916
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,061
He's looking at someone he loves.

917
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,188
