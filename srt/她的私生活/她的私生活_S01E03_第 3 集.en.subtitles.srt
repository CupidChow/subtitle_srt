1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,657
To high school seniors,
what kind of day is Saturday?

2
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,243
-The day we study until we puke.
-The day we study until we puke.

3
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,120
Right. Go home immediately

4
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,039
and devote all your time to your studies.

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,459
Gosh.

6
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,878
I guess Eun-gi is sound asleep.

7
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,588
Did you guys feed him before he dozed off?

8
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,299
-Yes, we fed him cup noodles.
-Good job.

9
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,885
Wake him up and tell him to come see me.
Okay, class president.

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,386
Attention.

11
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,139
Bow.

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,432
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,730
Hey.

14
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,608
Hey, wake up.

15
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,027
The class is over.
Our homeroom teacher wants to see you.

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,993
It's raining.
Gosh, I didn't bring an umbrella.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,752
Who gave you that?
Do you have a secret girlfriend?

18
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,923
-Goodness, I'm so jealous.
-Gosh, get off me.

19
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,834
You don't have an umbrella?

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,337
-Let me go.
-Why are you so unprepared?

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,421
What if you catch a cold?

22
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,674
Let me go while I'm being nice!

23
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,510
What are you going to do if I don't?

24
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,933
Give me that.

25
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,109
-Your hands.
-You're so annoying.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,573
Be polite.

27
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,746
Be cute.

28
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,094
Come home right away after your training.

29
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,888
Don't make Mom cook twice.

30
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,754
Hey, make sure you get it right.

31
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,757
Who are you?

32
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,303
Gosh, Sungduk.

33
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,889
Why are you all wet?

34
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,682
Where's the umbrella I gave you?

35
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,892
Tell me the truth.

36
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,810
That umbrella you gave me,

37
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,312
was it a gift?

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,647
Yes.

39
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,568
Are you crazy? How could you
lend me something you got as a gift?

40
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,403
You insensitive, crazy jerk!

41
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,488
What's the big deal?

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,615
What's so bad
about lending you something I got

43
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,824
as a gift?

44
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,788
You've never liked someone before,
have you?

45
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,832
The chocolates you eat on Valentine's Day
were given to you

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,167
by someone who really likes you.

47
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,671
And all those gifts you get are given
from somebody's heart.

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,673
They like you,

49
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,716
so they want you to eat and wear
something good.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,051
They're worried you might get wet,

51
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,886
or get blown away
when it's rainy and windy.

52
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,471
They always care and worry about you.

53
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,598
So they muster up their courage
to show you how they feel.

54
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,518
And yet, you just lend that precious gift

55
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,978
to a stranger!

56
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,231
We're not strangers.
And I never asked them to like me.

57
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,650
Why does she have to make a fuss
about a stupid gift?

58
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,694
You jerk.

59
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,908
Duk-mi, wait.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,121
You impolite jerk.

61
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,291
People like you don't deserve to live
in this community. You should die.

62
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,210
Just die. You don't deserve to live.

63
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,756
Hey, don't grab my hair. You little jerk.

64
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,509
Die, Eun-gi. Die! just die!

65
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,519
We have a meeting
with Cha Si-an of White Ocean.

66
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,738
SAUNA

67
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,825
They say it's impossible
for fanatics to get really lucky.

68
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,997
But life is unpredictable.

69
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,878
Yesterday, I cried
because I got fired from the museum.

70
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,715
But today, I'd get really lucky.

71
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,719
So let's live a long life, Seon-ju.

72
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,221
Is that what you're going to wear?

73
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,516
What did I just do?

74
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,188
Habits can be so scary.

75
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,649
Duk-mi, you're not going there
as a fangirl.

76
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,901
You're going there for work.

77
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,987
You're about to achieve
a fangirl's greatest goal.

78
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,823
You'll be working with the star
that you've been a fan of!

79
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,908
You're right.

80
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,454
Seon-ju, can you pick out an outfit
for me?

81
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,668
Let's see. Which one of my watches
will have the honor to meet Si-an?

82
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,925
I choose you.

83
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,973
-It's pretty.
-Duk-mi.

84
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,893
I know I shouldn't be asking you this.

85
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,771
Can you be on the phone with me later?

86
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,356
I'll be quiet and just listen
to his voice.

87
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,357
Duk-mi.

88
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,110
Seon-ju, I really need to go now. Bye.

89
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,820
Duk-mi. Hey.

90
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,452
I'm so jealous. I also want to see Si-an,

91
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,580
get his autograph,
and take photos with him.

92
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,586
Was that your way
of telling me to wake up?

93
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,463
You can deduct it from my paycheck.

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,299
Ju-hyeok.

95
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,261
There's no more money to deduct.

96
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,721
But I'm still not going to fire you.

97
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,267
I'm going to train you well
and get my money's worth.

98
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,064
I'm so jealous.

99
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,567
Gosh, I really want to be there as well.

100
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,276
That's the same jacket
that Sindy bought for Si-an.

101
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,404
It's like he got a matching jacket.

102
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,953
Do you feel okay?

103
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,372
Yes, as you can see.

104
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,879
I wasn't exactly sick enough
to receive flowers,

105
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,465
but I'll gratefully accept it
since you bought it.

106
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,595
Mr. Cha likes tulips.

107
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,727
-Do you want one?
-No, I don't.

108
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,023
I also brought a bottle of wine for him.

109
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,441
That's red wine.

110
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,069
Si-an prefers white wine.

111
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,570
"Si-an"?

112
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,241
I mean, Mr. Cha.

113
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,743
You seem to know his preferences
really well.

114
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,579
I tend to do some research
about my clients

115
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,665
before I have a meeting with them.

116
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,999
I make sure I always do that.

117
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,042
Let's go.

118
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
Ms. Sung Duk-mi.

119
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,877
Yes?

120
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,379
Never mind.

121
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,015
What's wrong? What is it?

122
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,145
-Do you hate Mr. Cha that much?
-Sorry?

123
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,648
It's your right to like or dislike people,

124
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,775
but we're here to ask for an artwork.

125
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,861
Please do a better job
at hiding your distaste.

126
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,701
Sure.

127
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,022
Oh, you're here early.

128
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,316
Si-an isn't ready yet,

129
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,943
but please wait inside.

130
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,789
Kong.

131
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,084
You must be...

132
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,921
I can't believe I'm seeing you in person.

133
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,035
No way.

134
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,747
Is it okay for me to be this blessed?

135
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,792
Si-an,

136
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm grateful but also sorry.

137
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,923
Even if I die now,
I wouldn't have regrets.

138
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,513
SUNG DUK-MI, 33
THE ROAD TO SI-AN, AN ULTIMATE FAN

139
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,146
This is the autopsy
of 33-year-old Sung Duk-mi.

140
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,689
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

141
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,156
There's no heart!

142
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,626
Look over here.
Her heart is in her right foot.

143
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,970
This is a case of one's heart
jumping out of the chest.

144
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,181
-We must report it.
-Yes, doctor.

145
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,641
This life

146
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,310
was a joy and a blessing.

147
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,690
Just looking at it comforts me.

148
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,694
It's the one
I'm most attached to actually.

149
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,696
Star, moon, and forest.

150
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,407
I feel like the artwork expresses
all of them.

151
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,910
I can tell that you truly love art.

152
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,754
Adorable. He's so adorable!

153
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,881
How can he be so cute?

154
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,939
These pieces over here

155
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,401
seem realistic, yet also surreal
at the same time.

156
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,029
You have a keen eye for art
just as I've heard.

157
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,059
This photo was taken by my first fan.

158
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,691
I was on my way
to my first show after debuting.

159
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,818
You can tell that I'm nervous.

160
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,656
The Road to Si-an took the photo.

161
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,162
It seems like no one knows me better
than this person

162
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,456
even though I have no clue
as to who this person is.

163
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,292
Weird, isn't it?

164
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,800
-Can I use the restroom?
-Yes, it's over there.

165
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,104
I lived well.

166
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,483
Truly...

167
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,819
I lived a good life.

168
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,128
Lucky you.

169
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,382
You get to see Si-an all the time.

170
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,269
Lucky you.

171
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,522
Every day, you get to...

172
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,570
My gosh, what am I thinking?

173
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,448
I can't believe I said that. Goodness.

174
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,047
Would you like some coffee or tea?

175
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,049
-Tea would be good.
-Okay.

176
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,329
Ms. Sung.

177
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,622
Yes?

178
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,964
I turned on the shower by accident.

179
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,185
Wear this.

180
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,356
Thank you.

181
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
Why would you...

182
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,746
-Thank you.
-Sure.

183
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,122
Thank you.

184
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,334
Thank you.

185
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,172
Rather than me just participating
in an exhibition with other artists,

186
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,174
I'd be having one under my name.

187
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,052
I feel a bit burdened by the scale of it.

188
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,013
It feels like I should have
more well-known artworks.

189
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,599
-That is--
-I'm sure some people will try

190
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,936
to evaluate your taste
with this exhibition.

191
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,605
However, it could also provide a chance

192
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,024
for many others to understand
what you like

193
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,027
and grow closer to you. Don't you think?

194
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,699
I'll also add
that you shouldn't be worried

195
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,827
about your taste for art.

196
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,956
The artwork you love the most

197
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,041
is good in my eyes too.

198
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,754
Director Gold also loves the art
by Lee Sol.

199
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,006
He even bought one himself.

200
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,804
Are you familiar with Lee Sol's work?

201
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,351
No, I was buying the artwork for a client.

202
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,982
I thought it was a good one, but then
I found out by chance that you owned one

203
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,733
of Lee Sol's pieces.

204
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,698
-By chance?
-Yes.

205
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,075
By chance.

206
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,169
See you again. Bye.

207
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,975
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it.

208
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,270
He was never quite interested
in the exhibition.

209
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,356
It's our job to persuade him
no matter what.

210
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,239
I called a cab.
I'm sure you brought your car.

211
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,328
Actually, I took the elevator.

212
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,252
You live in this building too?

213
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,254
Unit 2401.

214
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,966
Unit 2401? That's a floor
above Mr. Cha's apartment.

215
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,926
Yes.

216
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,015
Lucky you. I wish I could live
in Si-an's building too.

217
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,314
I'll get going then.

218
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,567
Oh, your jacket.

219
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
You can return it some other time.

220
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,036
Then I'll give it back tomorrow.

221
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,004
Hey, Seon-ju. What's up?

222
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,008
Hey.

223
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,804
The picture I took was hung up
on Si-an's wall.

224
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,155
He's a total superstar.

225
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,825
HIS PERSONALITY

226
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,335
THE ROAD TO SIAN

227
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,760
It seems like no one knows me better
than this person.

228
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,766
4TH, SEOUL MUSIC AWARDS TICKETING
6TH, FLIGHT TO HONG KONG FROM TAIWAN

229
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,939
PHOTO FROM SI-AN'S MUSIC VIDEO SHOOT
SI-AN'S FAVORITE ARTIST: LEE SOL

230
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,697
The door to Si-an's house opened,

231
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,741
-and Kong came running to me.
-Kong?

232
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,075
Kong looks even cuter in real life.

233
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,620
Anyway, I saw a halo shining
in that direction, so I looked.

234
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,247
And Si-an was walking toward me.

235
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,833
-He was wearing a bathrobe.
-My gosh.

236
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,835
His hair was wet,

237
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,962
and the water was dripping like this.

238
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,175
He looked at me with a sexy face.

239
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,718
You know the face he makes when he's shy?

240
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,636
-Of course I do.
-He had that face

241
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,847
and said, "Hello."

242
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,602
-I couldn't believe it.
-My gosh.

243
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,562
Isn't this insane?

244
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,814
-You are insane.
-I even saw his collarbone.

245
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,691
-Oh my gosh.
-I couldn't keep a straight face.

246
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,568
-I know.
-I couldn't help but smile.

247
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,248
SEON-JU

248
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,085
-Hey.
-Duk-mi, are you okay?

249
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,544
Weren't you terrorized?

250
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,880
I was terrorized. Terrorized by sleep.

251
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,757
I'm seriously so sleepy.

252
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,467
You haven't seen it yet, have you?

253
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,512
I'll send the link to the article,
so look at it right now.

254
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,561
WHO IS CHA SI-AN OF WHITE OCEAN DATING?

255
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,526
-Cha Si-an is caught in a love scandal.
-He has a girlfriend?

256
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,985
-He's dating?
-Who is it?

257
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,654
Is Si-an dating someone?

258
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,614
-This is Cha Si-an.
-Who is she?

259
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,865
Who is this woman?

260
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,992
I knew it. It's true
if an article has been printed.

261
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,619
No. It can't be.

262
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,747
Si-an doesn't even have time to date.
This is absurd.

263
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,666
No, this cannot be true.

264
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,212
Yellow journalism like this
is the problem of our country.

265
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,381
They print fake news
without even verifying it.

266
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,716
They're total trash.

267
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,718
He was busy all this time
with his schedule.

268
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,845
PHASE 3, BARGAINING

269
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,140
People tend to get lonely
when they feel physically tired.

270
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,891
He must've wanted to date.

271
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,186
I understand everything.

272
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,648
PHASE 4, DEPRESSION

273
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,483
I've been fangirling all these years

274
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,735
just for this?

275
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,239
I feel so ashamed.

276
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,242
Shall we just quit this damn fangirling?

277
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,120
PHASE 5, ACCEPTANCE

278
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,038
He's at an age when he wants to date.

279
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,665
Just let him date.

280
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,210
He has to date in order to break up.

281
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,962
Read the article till the end.

282
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,891
What is this? His manager posted this
on his social media.

283
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,809
They didn't even research properly.
He should've--

284
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,187
I told you to look at it closely. Look.

285
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,440
Look more closely!

286
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,275
It's a woman.

287
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,527
What is this woman doing
at Si-an's house? Who is she?

288
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,741
It's me.

289
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,204
-It's you.
-It's me?

290
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,794
So this jacket belongs
to your director, the Lion?

291
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,795
Yes.

292
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,714
He came wearing this jacket.

293
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,884
It's a limited-edition luxury brand.
Only one piece was imported here,

294
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,719
so the fans think Si-an owns the only one.

295
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,806
And a picture of me was taken
when I was wearing this jacket

296
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,350
inside Si-an's house.

297
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,644
It's the perfect case
where people can be mistaken.

298
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,566
What should I do?

299
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,818
I can't even post pictures freely

300
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,737
because I'm so afraid of your fans.

301
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,406
Why can't they just look?
What are they zooming in on it for?

302
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,533
And why did the woman have to be there?

303
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,202
This is all because of that exhibition.

304
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,871
I told you I didn't want to do it
from the beginning.

305
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,749
Si-an.

306
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,376
How will you handle the scandal?

307
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,627
Don't worry about it.

308
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,546
We'll publish an article saying she came
to talk about an exhibition.

309
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,675
Instead, you have to continue
with the exhibition.

310
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,926
Okay?

311
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,806
This is really you, Ms. Sung?

312
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,811
I always believed scandals
about celebrities,

313
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,021
but I guess some articles
are really ridiculous like this.

314
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,024
White Ocean is the hottest group.

315
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,820
And you're the girlfriend of Cha Si-an,
the most popular member.

316
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,781
-I'd like to be a part of--
-"Bullshit.

317
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,992
My Si-an would never do that.

318
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,494
I knew that jerk Si-an
was fooling all of you.

319
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,830
I can hear all his fans
turning their backs on him."

320
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,458
There are more than 1,000 comments
from his fans and haters.

321
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,459
Over 1,000?

322
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,839
"I can already tell the woman's face
is extremely repulsive."

323
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,799
"Extremely repulsive"?

324
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,803
That's not a common expression.

325
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,806
"Watch your back at night."

326
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,954
They're more than capable of killing.

327
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,837
I heard the fans of White Ocean
are notorious for being obsessive.

328
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,048
What if they find out
your personal information?

329
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,550
Fans are all like that.

330
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,510
I wouldn't say they're more obsessive
than others.

331
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,847
Ms. Sung, you are seriously so naive.

332
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,849
Do you know how scary fans are?

333
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,352
What is Cha Si-an's agency saying?

334
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,063
They told me
they're going to publish an article

335
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,315
denying it soon
and I shouldn't worry and wait.

336
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,484
Did you tell your boyfriend?

337
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,362
Boyfriend? Do I have a boyfriend?

338
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,656
You got drunk during our team dinner
and confessed last time.

339
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,824
What was it?

340
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,328
You said he has such a beautiful smile

341
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,671
and he's so competent.

342
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,346
You remember, right?

343
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,848
He's not my boyfriend.

344
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,475
Whether or not he's your boyfriend

345
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,436
post his picture on your social media
for everyone to see.

346
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,272
Even if they find out about you,
that picture will show

347
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,150
you're not Cha Si-an's girlfriend.
That will explain everything.

348
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,735
-That sounds good.
-That is...

349
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,738
Do you have a picture you took with him?
I'll choose it for you.

350
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,909
-Yes, totally!
-We can do it!

351
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,202
Oh, gosh.

352
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,538
What will you do?

353
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,209
Ms. Sung!

354
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,254
Yes, Director.

355
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,967
Shouldn't you be working right now?

356
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,554
I think you've been chatting for too long.

357
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,638
I'm sorry, sir.

358
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,196
I mean, how could this be chatting?

359
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,823
The safety of an employee is on the line.

360
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,325
Director Gold is quite insensitive.

361
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,869
Have some respect for your boss.

362
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,247
He's cold-blooded.

363
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,672
Did you really check?

364
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,674
-I did.
-Are you sure it's accurate?

365
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,470
Si-an will never do that to us.
He'll never date behind our backs.

366
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,849
-Please say it isn't true.
-Please say something, mister.

367
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,560
Hey, they published an article
explaining it.

368
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,936
They're denying it, right?

369
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,563
-They wouldn't admit it easily.
-I knew it.

370
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,231
-Tell me about it.
-Let's get out of here.

371
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,151
-Let's go.
-What happened though?

372
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,195
What a waste of time.

373
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,404
Si-an said it wasn't true.

374
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,158
"The woman in the photo
is an art museum curator.

375
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,911
And she visited Cha Si-an's house
to talk about his art collection.

376
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,164
Her top accidentally got wet,
so she wore Cha Si-an's...

377
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,169
She wore Cha Si-an's jacket just
for a short while in his house.

378
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,837
She's not his girlfriend.

379
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,006
And he did not give his jacket
to her as a gift."

380
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,650
Hello, this is Ryan Gold,
the director of Cheum Museum.

381
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,197
The article you released
wasn't entirely correct.

382
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,450
Why did you say it was Mr. Cha's jacket?

383
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,244
That jacket is a limited edition.

384
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,746
Do you think his fans would believe it
if we tell them that there were

385
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,414
two identical jackets in this house?

386
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,667
So you're just going to lie to them?

387
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,044
Director Gold, people don't

388
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,255
care about the truth.

389
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,465
They just see what they want to see

390
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,092
and believe what they want to believe.

391
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,594
Don't you think it'd be better

392
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,806
to tell them a believable lie
than an unbelievable truth?

393
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,810
We took care of the scandal,
and you'll get to do the exhibition.

394
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,436
Isn't that a win-win?

395
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,397
Let's just drop it.

396
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,654
Yes, Director Gold.

397
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,031
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN
IN THE UNIVERSE, CHA SI-AN

398
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:07,949
Yes.

399
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,413
Okay, that does make sense.

400
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,999
No, I'm okay.

401
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,459
Thank you for worrying.

402
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,755
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

403
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,554
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN IN THE UNIVERSE
CHA SI-AN

404
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,227
HIS AGENCY EXPLAINED THAT SHE VISITED
BECAUSE OF HIS ART COLLECTION

405
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,898
Okay, it's time to do my job now.

406
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:44,611
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

407
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,949
This is all Mr. Park's fault.

408
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,993
I knew he'd cause trouble one day.

409
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,620
He should've been more careful.

410
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,332
But the fact that she wore Si-an's jacket
hasn't changed at all.

411
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,918
I feel so upset about that.
It makes me feel so uneasy.

412
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,669
Apparently, her clothes got wet.

413
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,255
I'd rather have her wear his jacket
than stay next to him all wet.

414
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,634
By the way,
she can't be Si-an's fan, right?

415
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,844
If she was a fan,
she wouldn't have been able to wear that.

416
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,346
I wouldn't even dare to touch it.

417
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,973
Mr. Park needs to get fired.

418
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,767
MY SI-AN, SI-AN IN MY HEART

419
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,727
THE ROAD TO SI-AN

420
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,111
He's so handsome.

421
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,197
SI-AN IN MY HEART

422
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,157
-It's Si-an!
-Look.

423
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,119
Si-an's first-ever scandal
turned out to be false,

424
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,704
so here's a photo to celebrate that.

425
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,873
-You're the best!
-Nice!

426
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,052
"She wore

427
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,722
Cha Si-an's jacket just
for a short while in his house."

428
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,146
I got this jacket for him as a gift.
How dare he lend it

429
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,564
to another woman?

430
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,125
I can't believe this.
"Is Si-an really dating?"

431
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,127
-Really?
-Let me see.

432
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,045
IS SI-AN REALLY DATING?

433
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,254
GIRLFRIEND OF C FROM THE GROUP W

434
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,672
I knew it.

435
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,675
The best time to read celebrity scandals
is 2 p.m.

436
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,011
I was getting sleepy,
but this just woke me up.

437
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,098
Is this true?

438
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,100
CHA SI-AN'S FANPAGE BY SINDY

439
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,527
SDM, 33 YEARS OLD, A CURATOR AT C MUSEUM

440
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,533
CHA SI-AN, SDM

441
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,912
This is bad.

442
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,415
Sindy is a total groupie.

443
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,710
Why was she on a stakeout
in front of Si-an's house?

444
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,879
Is she a cop or something?

445
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,381
This is making me get angry.

446
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,761
Knock, knock. Is this the number
of Cha Si-an's girlfriend?

447
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,847
EUN-GI INVITED SEON-JU
AND SUNGDUK TO THE CHAT

448
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,644
Knock, knock.

449
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,687
Hey, Cha Si-an's girlfriend.

450
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,358
Knock, knock.

451
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,279
SUNGDUK HAS LEFT THE CHAT ROOM

452
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,490
You're doomed.

453
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,575
Do you think this is funny?

454
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,369
How can you laugh in this situation?

455
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,662
Then do you expect me to cry?

456
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,706
My friend got involved in a scandal
with her favorite idol star.

457
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,042
I should be dancing right now.

458
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,669
You'll get stabbed if you dance.

459
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,629
Do you not care about all the other fans

460
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,840
who are worried
that Si-an really might really be dating?

461
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,758
What's wrong with him dating?

462
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,510
Yes, he can date people.

463
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,554
But he should never get caught.

464
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,305
What's the difference?

465
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm saying he should be someone
we all dream of dating,

466
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,185
but he should never be
someone's actual sweetheart.

467
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,104
What are you saying?

468
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,191
To be frank, an idol star is a merchant,
and a fan is a consumer.

469
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,402
They toy with us
by saying that they love us

470
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,195
and that we're the only ones
they'll ever love.

471
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,990
They're selling romance by doing that.

472
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,159
But if that star gets caught
dating someone,

473
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,995
it's the same thing
as going against their morals.

474
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,080
You're the one
who went against your morals.

475
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,457
Yes, exactly.

476
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,459
I'm the problem.

477
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,461
Gosh, these crazy fangirls.

478
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,548
What are you going to do?
They even found your social media account.

479
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,425
They saw all the matching items you bought

480
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,218
and how we visited that hotel
he once stayed at.

481
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,181
There are way too many photos
to call it a coincidence.

482
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,017
Yes, I know. I was really startled.

483
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,228
I made sure to keep it low-key,
but I left too many traces.

484
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,980
What if people find out
that you're Si-an's fan

485
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,816
and that you're the fanpage master,
The Road to Si-an?

486
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,359
-I got goosebumps.
-I got goosebumps.

487
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,153
They'll get rid of me
without anyone finding out.

488
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,446
-Like the morning dew.
-Yes.

489
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,947
I send my condolences to you in advance.

490
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,949
Rest in peace.

491
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,958
No.

492
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,337
No, there's no way that...

493
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,173
"Bitch"?

494
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,343
I'm someone's precious daughter, you know.

495
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,803
How dare you swear at me?

496
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,557
Hey, I'll see you at the police station.

497
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,725
This is being recorded.

498
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,518
You... Hello?

499
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,520
This is so annoying.

500
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,690
Gosh.

501
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,115
I wouldn't feel so upset
if she was actually dating him.

502
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,825
I'm just getting cursed for no reason.

503
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,375
Ms. Sung, you should be careful
when you walk alone at night.

504
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,002
I don't think she'll be safe
during the day either.

505
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,838
Our online bulletin board
is complete chaos right now.

506
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,341
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

507
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,926
We can't do anything about the calls,

508
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,761
but let's shut down
the bulletin board for a while.

509
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,971
-Okay.
-Okay.

510
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,809
AUCTION FOR VIP CLIENTS OF SEJONG BANK

511
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,526
Mr. Park.

512
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,904
Ms. Sung's personal information
is all over the internet.

513
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,489
And people are swearing
and threatening her

514
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,074
on our museum's online bulletin board.

515
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,575
But you're still in a meeting?

516
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,537
Don't you think
you're being too nonchalant?

517
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,001
I'll call you back.

518
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,176
Si-an's agency wants to wait
until this passes by

519
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,053
instead of confronting it.

520
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,349
I feel like they should handle it better.
What do you think?

521
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,812
People already found out that they lied,

522
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,189
so nothing will work as of now.

523
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,609
It might be best to leave it
and hope that it'll fade with time.

524
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,781
I should've told them to correct
the first article they sent out.

525
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,868
I'm sorry. I should've been more careful.

526
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,369
It's not your fault.

527
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,246
Things would not have gotten out
of hand like this

528
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,957
if it weren't for that groupie.

529
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,460
Groupie?

530
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,006
I'm not very familiar
with stuff like this,

531
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,593
but a groupie is a fan
who always follows their idols around.

532
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,513
A groupie is more like a stalker
than a fan.

533
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,640
Anyway, I heard it got out of hand

534
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,934
because that groupie
uploaded a photo of me.

535
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,359
I have to get going because I need
to attend an auction and lecture

536
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,361
for Sejong Bank's VIP clients.

537
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,613
You should go.

538
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,864
Okay.

539
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,180
My gosh. Hey.

540
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,975
Why are you doing this? Gosh, that stings.

541
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,601
You bitch!

542
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,228
-You cow!
-How dare you!

543
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,689
-Die!
-Not my Si-an!

544
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,649
How dare you date my Si-an!

545
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,151
You bitch!

546
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,154
-Please.
-Take that!

547
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,114
-You!
-Take this!

548
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,993
Get off me!

549
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,328
Duk-mi, it's me. It's Eun-gi.

550
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,746
Oh, gosh.

551
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,540
Are they insane?

552
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,041
Eun-gi.

553
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,720
-Stop!
-Get them!

554
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,972
-Stop! Stop right there.
-Hey!

555
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,267
Hey!

556
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,519
Stop!

557
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,271
You!

558
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,816
Get them!

559
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,151
Over there!

560
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,406
Are you all right?

561
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,620
Let's go.

562
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,888
Eggs are expensive these days.

563
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,642
Why not spend the money
to buy Si-an's album instead?

564
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,030
Sure. Thank you.

565
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,121
The assailants are all at the precinct.

566
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,207
We meet again for an unfortunate event.

567
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,377
The day you went to the ER.

568
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,589
I see you don't remember.

569
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,884
Ms. Sung didn't mention a friend of hers.

570
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,594
Others normally think I'm her boyfriend.

571
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,514
I apologize for the late introduction.

572
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,141
I'm Ryan Gold, Director of Cheum Museum.

573
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,644
"Gold,

574
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,479
Ryan."

575
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,733
I'm a director too, you know.

576
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,569
Here.

577
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,282
CHOIKANG JUDO

578
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,617
So you manage a judo studio.

579
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,119
Duk-mi and I...

580
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,374
Well, I'm her brother.
It's nice to meet you.

581
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,886
Director Gold, I'm now off to Sejong Bank.

582
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,973
You must still be in shock,
so call it a day.

583
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,474
I'll go in your place.

584
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,019
It's all right.
Being busy is actually better.

585
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,521
Besides, I need to stop
by the precinct anyway.

586
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,814
I'll go with you, then.

587
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,277
I'm sure she'll be more comfortable
with me.

588
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,903
I'll go with Eun-gi.

589
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,573
Head straight home afterward then.

590
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,741
Sure.

591
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,078
Let's go.

592
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,042
The coast is clear.
The police arrested them all.

593
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,295
You seemed intimidated
in front of the director

594
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,921
and even shy.

595
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,257
Do you act rudely to your coach, then?

596
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,092
You know my coach can be scary.

597
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,053
Well, my boss can fire me.

598
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,518
Are you really all right?

599
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,145
No, I'm not all right.

600
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,730
It hurt like crazy.

601
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,815
We should head to a pharmacy
before it leaves a scar.

602
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,942
No, I'm going to the precinct first.

603
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,488
As fans, they should hope
for the scandal to dial down.

604
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,989
They shouldn't add fuel to the flame.

605
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,700
I'm giving them an earful!

606
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,452
Follow me.

607
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,412
As if.

608
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,292
What is it?

609
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,339
Ms. Sung has been caught up
in a romantic scandal with a K-pop idol.

610
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,345
Sung Duk-mi and a K-pop idol?

611
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,015
Are you kidding me?

612
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,143
I've confined myself to this hospital

613
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,604
to save Cheum's reputation,

614
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,773
but she does this in my absence?

615
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,066
What's your take on this?

616
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,653
Well, this rumor--

617
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,196
What's your take on it?

618
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,823
Well...

619
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,785
So this was all for a celebrity you like?

620
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:13,377
Call this the Cheum Museum Assault Case.

621
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,508
Unbelievable.

622
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,343
Look at what you did to her.

623
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,720
This qualifies as an assault.

624
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,681
Do you know how severe the charges are?

625
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,350
I am Sung Duk-mi, the victim.

626
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,689
No one's going home tonight.
Who led the assault?

627
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,859
Weren't you mouthing off just until now?

628
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,445
Who led the assault? Was it you?

629
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:46,076
She took off with the jacket
that we bought for Si-an.

630
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,995
You gave him the gift,
and so it ends there.

631
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,913
That doesn't give you any right
to do this.

632
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,957
You've never liked anyone, have you?

633
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,461
What we gave him wasn't
just some expensive jacket.

634
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,171
We like him so much

635
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,007
that we wanted to see him
in a pretty jacket.

636
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,925
What we gave him out of love,

637
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,677
she...

638
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,395
Detective.

639
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,190
It was no big deal, so please let them go.

640
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,316
Duk-mi!

641
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,569
How is this not a big deal?

642
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,654
You're covered in bandages like a mummy.

643
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
Oh, this?

644
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,868
I was just putting on a show.

645
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,745
See? I'm fine.

646
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,955
How can it be an assault when I'm fine?

647
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,624
Are you sure you're all right?

648
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,625
Yes.

649
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,630
Don't cry. I won't forgive you if you do.

650
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,759
Hold on.

651
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,638
Are you really dating Si-an?

652
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,889
Are you serious right now?

653
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,851
No, I met Mr. Cha
for the first time that day.

654
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,895
Then why were you wearing his jacket?

655
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,482
Well, actually,

656
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,150
it's not his jacket.

657
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,529
What? Sindy said
that there's only one of it in Korea.

658
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,948
Right, that's why his agency
got it mixed up.

659
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,533
It belongs to someone else.

660
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,909
Is that the truth?

661
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,203
Are you sure there is nothing
between you and Si-an?

662
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,288
Nothing. I promise you that.

663
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,543
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

664
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,753
-Gosh, we're sorry!
-We're sorry!

665
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,925
What a saint.

666
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,718
You should change your name
to Saint Duk-mi.

667
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,097
I'm furious

668
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,808
and the girls should be punished,

669
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,101
but

670
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,397
I understand why they had to take
such action.

671
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,484
Why can't you show me some
of that grace and tolerance as well?

672
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,571
Why do you think you're still alive?

673
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,406
Right.

674
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,243
You can't tell Mom
about what happened today.

675
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,494
I'm not an idiot, you know.

676
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,414
I know what not to eat
and what I shouldn't say.

677
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,543
Good boy. I'm off then.

678
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,172
Be safe out there.

679
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,813
Director, how about lunch?

680
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,898
You guys go ahead. I'll eat later.

681
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,693
Did Ms. Sung go to the precinct alone?

682
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,069
She should've asked me to tag along.

683
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,904
Her brother went with her,

684
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,323
and I heard they settled.

685
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,907
She has a brother?

686
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,952
I heard that she's an only child.

687
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,416
-I'm home.
-Hey.

688
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,337
Editor Nam, you're here.

689
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:46,923
What brings you here?

690
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,927
Am I your friend?

691
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,096
"Editor Nam. What brings you here?"

692
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,727
Editor Nam. Welcome.

693
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,859
At least act like you're glad
to see your mom after a while.

694
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,945
-Hi, Mom.
-Gosh.

695
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,073
CHOIKANG JUDO

696
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,701
"Men's silver medalist in judo,

00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,254
-Do you want more rice?
-Yes.

699
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,174
Give me. Oh, boy.

700
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:33,178
Yeong-suk, I told you not
to feed him anymore.

701
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,514
Until when are you going
to take care of him?

702
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,891
How could I not
when my child says he's hungry?

703
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,393
Editor Nam doesn't get it.

704
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,437
Parents feel full
just by watching their children eat.

705
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,859
Someone might think Yeong-suk
is your real mom and I'm a stepmom.

706
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,445
Your name is Nam Eun-gi,
which follows my last name.

707
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,822
It isn't Sung Eun-gi.

708
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,325
Let's be honest, Editor Nam.

709
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,828
All you did was give birth to me,
but Mom raised me.

710
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,287
She raised me all on her own.

711
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,123
You have no right.

712
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,668
Mom raised me for 20 years,
and the country has raised me since.

713
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,378
I made money.

714
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,296
-Do you think making money is easy?
-Right.

715
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,508
Your mom worked hard
to feed you and clothe you.

716
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,136
We raised you together.

717
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,346
Yeong-suk raised you with love,
and I raised you with money.

718
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,265
A person should do that at least.

719
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,559
You're like a cuckoo
that laid an egg in another bird's nest.

720
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,811
Gosh, Eun-gi, have some of this.

721
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,355
Just watching you eat makes me feel full.

722
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,317
I'm probably the only person
in this world paying for a nanny

723
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,694
for a child this big.

724
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,322
-Use this for food.
-You don't have to give me this.

725
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,741
No, you must take it.

726
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,243
If I don't do this much,
he'd kill me with his nagging.

727
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,663
His mouth is stronger than his muscles.

728
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,837
Well, then. I have no choice
but to accept this gratefully.

729
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,842
I wonder how our lives got tied up
like this

730
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,969
ever since we met
at the maternity ward until now.

731
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,971
You saved a single mother.

732
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,474
Life is about giving and taking.

733
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,059
I got through a hard time, thanks to you.

734
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,313
You're the only one
who brings me money regularly.

735
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,650
If my husband did that,
I would've been such a devoted wife.

736
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,073
Officially, I should be lying
in a hospital right now,

737
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,741
so I'll make it short.

738
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,372
Ms. Sung Duk-mi

739
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,333
has been caught in a love scandal
with an idol.

740
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,586
I really, really hate it.

741
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,797
Fire Ms. Sung right away.

742
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,967
It was just a scandal
that wasn't even true,

743
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,553
and I won't fire her
over something like that.

744
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,764
Whether it's true or not doesn't matter.

745
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,768
What matters is
that rumors have been spread.

746
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,687
I can't stand her

747
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,399
ruining my reputation anymore.

748
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:36,528
A curator should maintain the dignity
and class of the museum.

749
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,865
How could she get caught up
in such a cheap scandal?

750
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,616
Fire her immediately.

751
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,869
Fire her now.

752
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,957
What right do you have?

753
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,751
Sorry?

754
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,128
What right do you have

755
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,715
to order me to fire my staff?

756
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,843
I'm Eom So-hye.

757
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:06,141
I had one condition when I accepted
the director position of this museum.

758
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,352
"Give up all your rights to this place."

759
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,646
Even if you want to judge
or make decisions

760
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,315
regarding the employees of Cheum Museum,

761
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,566
just don't.

762
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,867
Due to my family matters,
I had no choice but to--

763
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,537
Is your husband's embezzlement
and malpractice a family matter?

764
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,916
The class and dignity of the museum?

765
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,837
Cheum Museum's name was tainted
in the newspapers because of you.

766
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,758
Yet, you're acting like this
over some gossip about a celebrity?

767
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,593
It's amusing.

768
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:43,929
"Amusing"?

769
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,599
You're upset.

770
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,477
Oh, you don't want to fire her?

771
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,689
Then will you accept a letter
of resignation that she submits

772
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,815
on her own will?

773
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,445
It's not like there's only one way
to get rid of someone.

774
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:01,905
Oh, my right?

775
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,700
Since I'm the one
who put you in this position,

776
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,454
I came to you out of courtesy
to discuss it with you first.

777
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,539
But I guess I'll just have to take care
of it myself.

778
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,254
Former Director Eom So-hye.

779
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,215
Yes?

780
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,011
I want to ask you something.

781
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,728
Where is Ivanoff's painting?

782
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,774
What painting?

783
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,152
The Ivanoff art piece
that you won at a Chinese auction.

784
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,862
Where is it?

785
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,116
How come there isn't a single piece
of a document about it?

786
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,076
And why can't I find it
in the storage room either?

787
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,622
I don't know what you're talking about.

788
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,625
Will it jog your memory
if a prosecutor asks you?

789
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,503
You still have a trial coming up, right?

790
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,675
Did Ms. Sung Duk-mi

791
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,136
tell you that?

792
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,639
No, I found out by chance at the auction.

793
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,765
That's enough.

794
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,687
Mr. Kim.

795
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,523
Mr. Kim!

796
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,778
She's more naive than I thought.

797
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,649
Stop right there.

798
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,068
Director Eom, what brings you--

799
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,794
-Director Eom.
-Ms. Sung.

800
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,714
I really trusted you.

801
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,801
But how could you do that to me?

802
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,100
-That scandal with the idol--
-I am not...

803
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,521
I'm not talking about that right now.

804
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,483
I'll have my eyes on you.

805
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,319
Okay?

806
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,571
You better watch it.

807
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,238
-Ms. Sung.
-Yes, Director Gold.

808
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,995
I told you to go straight home.

809
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,538
Why did you come back?

810
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,582
I had some documents to send out.

811
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,378
I don't think this is something
you should be so angry about.

812
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,214
Go in then.

813
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,341
Okay.

814
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,736
Where do you sleep? Do you still sleep
in a tent at the judo studio?

815
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,739
I sleep at the studio
and also in Duk-mi's room.

816
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,157
Duk-mi moved out.

817
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,579
I'll pay back the money you lent me
by next month.

818
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,122
Use it to rent a studio apartment.

819
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,000
Don't worry about it. I'm doing fine.

820
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,462
Still, you should sleep
at the same place at least.

821
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,800
Am I too shameless to be worried
about something like this now?

822
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,011
No.

823
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,598
Why did you open the judo studio?

824
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,809
Who learns judo these days?
You should've become a coach.

825
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,353
Mom.

826
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,356
Judo is really fun.
I can't just do it by myself.

827
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,026
I, the Olympic silver medalist,
must step up and take the lead

828
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,073
until everyone in our country learns judo.

829
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,950
That's what I think.

830
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,493
Goodness.

831
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,995
You talk so eloquently.
Why don't you become a narrator?

832
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,622
By the way,

833
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,875
I couldn't say anything earlier
because Yeong-suk was there.

834
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,877
But I heard something weird today.

835
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,548
I heard an art museum curator
is dating an idol star.

836
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,758
And I think they were talking
about Duk-mi.

837
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,593
That's just a bunch of nonsense.
You know Duk-mi.

838
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,053
Even if it's nonsense,

839
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,097
it's not great to be involved
in a rumor like that.

840
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,433
What's that? What happened?
It's really red.

841
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,352
-I think a bug bit me.
-Let me see.

842
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,813
Gosh, you should go now.
Drive safely. It's dark.

843
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,190
My goodness.

844
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,110
Are you still worried
even though your mom is like a cuckoo?

845
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,950
It's nice to have a cuckoo as a mom
than having none.

846
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,789
-You should get going.
-I'll go now.

847
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,374
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

848
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,322
-Director Gold, I'm--
-Quiet.

849
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,489
Pardon?

850
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,012
Why are you still here?

851
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,056
I'm sure it was a long day for you.

852
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,892
That's why.

853
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,812
I enjoy looking at artworks
whenever I'm having a hard time.

854
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,316
Do they console you?

855
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,237
They console me in a weird way.

856
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,245
On days like this,
I tend to blame myself a little.

857
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:11,334
"You have to go through so much,
you're always exhausted,

858
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,961
and you don't even get
properly acknowledged.

859
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,339
But must you continue to do this job?

860
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,761
Are those artworks really worth it?"

861
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:22,970
That's what I ask myself.

862
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,142
Are they worth it?

863
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:29,936
No.

864
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,690
Art may be great,

865
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,025
but it can't be greater
than a living human being.

866
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,614
Regardless of
how insignificant I may seem,

867
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,909
I'm still greater
than those condescending paintings

868
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,869
that are hung on that wall.

869
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,957
Because I'm a living being,
and I will continue to live.

870
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,763
That must have sounded
quite inappropriate.

871
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,933
I'm just trying to overcome my hardships.

872
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,728
But of course,

873
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:15,982
I think your artworks are a lot greater
than me.

874
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,320
That's what I also thought.

875
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,742
"My artworks are magnificent.

876
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,579
A lot more magnificent than myself."

877
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,170
You know
that I got adopted overseas, right?

878
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,922
Yes.

879
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,759
I was the kid that got abandoned
by his birth parents,

880
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,428
who couldn't even talk properly.

881
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,891
And because of that,
I was used to getting teased at,

882
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,436
and people always looked down on me.

883
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,942
But on the other hand,
the paintings created by that kid

884
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,446
always received compliments.

885
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,620
I don't paint now,

886
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,289
and I've never considered myself
greater than my paintings

887
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,293
just because of the fact
that I'm a living being.

888
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,468
Thank you for teaching me that.

889
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,729
And...

890
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,273
I'm sorry.

891
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,692
Pardon? For what?

892
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,571
I talked to Director Eom about Ivanoff.

893
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,532
I asked her where the painting was.

894
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,950
That's why she slapped you.

895
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,287
No wonder.

896
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,211
I shouldn't have acted all fine.
I'm embarrassed now.

897
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,966
-Ms. Sung.
-Please forget about it.

898
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,467
I'll do the same.

899
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:10,972
Let's go now.

900
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,407
Director Gold, you're very good
at apologizing.

901
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,452
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was a compliment.

902
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,499
Even just now,
I wouldn't have known about it

903
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,710
if you didn't apologize.

904
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,547
It's not easy to admit and be honest

905
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,800
about what you did wrong and apologize.

906
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,387
Even harder when you're the boss.

907
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,725
I may be insensitive,
but I don't want to be a coward.

908
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,060
Did you hear that?

909
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:03,566
I don't want to become irresponsible
like my birth parents who abandoned me.

910
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,068
I'll drive you home.
I'm sure it was a long day.

911
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,613
-And...
-And because you feel sorry?

912
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,410
Have you not forgotten about it yet?
I told you to put it behind you.

913
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,916
I'm going to go home now.
I want to take a walk by myself.

914
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,043
I'll see you tomorrow.

915
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,554
What brings you--

916
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,562
Regardless of
how insignificant I may seem,

917
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,399
I'm still greater
than those condescending paintings

918
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,109
that are hung on that wall.

919
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,530
Because I'm a living being,
and I will continue to live.

920
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:31,922
Ms. Sung.

921
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,510
Are you okay?

922
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,265
Wait here.

923
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,654
Who are you?

924
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,490
She is

925
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,575
my girlfriend.

926
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,497
She's my girlfriend!

927
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,539
He's my boyfriend.

928
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,707
Why does it have to be that director?
It could have been me.

929
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,252
I have something to return
to Cha Si-an's fanpage master.

930
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,420
-Who is it?
-It's all my fault.

931
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:57,007
I can't wait to see and learn
new things at Cheum Museum of Art.

932
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,260
Then are you saying
she could be Si-an's fan?

933
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,637
The Road to Si-an must be a special fan.

934
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,722
Can you keep this a secret?

935
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,182
All it takes is one lie.

936
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,518
I'm embarrassed to say this
in front of you, but...

937
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,937
You can have me all to yourself.
You're my girlfriend.

938
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,441
