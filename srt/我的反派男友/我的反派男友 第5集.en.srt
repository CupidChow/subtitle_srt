174
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,919
that you met a perfect guy like me.

175
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,870
I don't like

176
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,309
materialistic girls.

177
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,870
Luckily,

178
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,190
we have a common goal.

179
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,890
Mister, may I know what goal it is?

180
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,600
Just like you,

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,030
I wish to have three children.

182
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,710
I don't wish to give birth.

183
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,640
We don't need

184
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,450
to form a good relationship.

185
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,250
You just need

186
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,480
to form a good relationship
with my parents.

187
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Although I'm jobless now,

188
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,210
I think

189
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,010
I have huge potential.

190
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm a diamond in the rough.

191
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,960
No problem.

192
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,310
I'm only 34 years older than you.

193
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,460
I'm sure we'll lead a happy life.

194
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,560
[Xiao Wudi, you're too much.]

195
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,370
[Even if I've never been
in a relationship before,]

196
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,540
[that doesn't mean that
I'm desperate to get a boyfriend.]

197
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,380
[Nan Xing]

198
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,280
I'll send you home

199
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,420
after dinner.

200
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,850
I need to finish up my contract later.

201
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,710
I need to use it tomorrow morning.

202
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,650
Actually, you didn't have to come here.

203
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,710
I could've grabbed a bite somewhere.

204
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,670
That won't do.

205
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,890
No matter how busy we are,

206
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,690
we need to take our meals on time.

207
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,440
[Lu Zichen]

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,390
[Lu Zichen]

209
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,800
[I completed the current issue.]

210
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,860
[Come and take it.]

211
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,990
It's fine. You can return first.

212
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,730
[Lu Zichen]

213
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,560
[Nan Xing]

214
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,440
[Miss Ye]

215
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,580
I need to answer a call.

216
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,040
Hello, Miss Ye?

217
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,160
[Hello, Nan Xing?]

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,330
Head to Mr. Lu's house

219
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,840
and bring the completed manuscript
to the company.

220
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,570
I'll send you

221
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,770
the address immediately.

222
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,100
Bring it to the company?

223
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,880
I was the one doing it in the past.

224
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,740
But now, I think

225
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,020
you should take over the job.

226
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,650
Alright!

227
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,400
I'll be there immediately.

228
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,930
I'll be there immediately.

229
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,640
Please open the door for me.

230
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,180
Thanks.

231
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,290
Taxi!

232
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,020
Where are you going?

233
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,970
I need to retrieve the completed
manuscript from my boss's house.

234
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,470
When will you come back?

235
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,660
You expect me to come back?

236
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,210
You didn't even

237
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,810
filter out

238
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,180
the people you chose for me.

239
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,780
You're being too picky here.

240
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,540
I'm too picky?

241
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,800
Who will be responsible

242
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,400
for my life

243
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,110
if I'm not picky?

244
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,820
Will you be responsible for it?

245
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,150
Why should I be responsible for your life?

246
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,030
She's pretty picky.

247
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,580
[Connecting.]

248
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,140

[8825252.]

252
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,040
Boss,

253
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,890
I'm Nan Xing.

254
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,540
I'm here to retrieve the manuscript.

255
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,780
Are you at home?

256
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,940
I'll come in now.

257
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,340
Boss?

258
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,920
Boss?

259
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,800
So, this is where

260
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,180
our boss does his work.

261
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,280
He's very serious.

262
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm the first person

263
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,000
in the world

264
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,140
to get my hands on this manuscript.

265
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,200
If the forum hears about it,

266
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,380
the fans

267
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,830
will be so jealous of me.

268
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,150
Help! Xiao Wudi!

269
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,460
[Help! Xiao Wudi!]

270
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,070
Help!

271
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,640
Xiao Wudi,

272
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,500
check out the bathroom.

273
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,550
Don't panic.

274
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,850
I'll take a look.

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,850
How was it?

276
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,570
Is he dead or alive?

277
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
What a shame.

278
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,660
What do you mean? Is he dead?

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,930
It's a shame that he's still alive.

280
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,390
What the heck?

281
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,110
It's just rose bath salt.

282
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,850
Can't he pick a different colour?

283
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,940
He made it as if he committed suicide.

284
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,670
Enough.

285
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,430
Is he your boss?

286
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,260
Is he truly just unconscious?

287
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,090
Judging from his pulse,

288
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,020
he's been overexerting himself
for a long time.

289
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,490
He was experiencing qi and
blood deficiency for the past few days.

290
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,040
However, this isn't a big deal.

291
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,770
He'll be fine after some
acupuncture treatment.

292
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,950
If that's the case,

293
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,120
do I need to make him

294
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,840
some chicken soup

295
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,010
or buy some ginseng for him?

296
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,140
Or do I need to send him to the hospital?

297
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,550
Who are you?

298
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,560
Who is he?

299
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,660
Surprise! It's me!

300
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,349
It's you?

301
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,270
What are you guys doing at my house?

302
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm here to retrieve the manuscript.

303
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,170
Did Ye Qing tell you to come?

304
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,210
Isn't it obvious?

305
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,520
Look at how weak you are.

306
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,720
You fell unconscious during your bath.

307
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,630
What's wrong with you?

308
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,990
Deficiency of qi and blood, huh?

309
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,520
It's an old ailment of mine.

310
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,020
There's food in the fridge.

311
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,230
Bring it here for me.

312
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,090
You can go.

313
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,850
My legs are numb.

314
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,070
I cannot walk.

315
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,080
Who is he?

316
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,250
I'm her neighbour.

317
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,160
I was the one who sent her here.

318
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,870
Sorry about this.

319
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,470
That was embarrassing of me.

320
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,030
If there's nothing else,

321
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,360
we'll make a move first.

322
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,040
Okay.

323
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,570
Wait,

324
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,790
did I just

325
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
say all those things in front of him?

326
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,380
Why don't I

327
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,640
resign tomorrow?

328
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,000
You're treating him

329
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,590
in a special way, huh?

330
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,320
Isn't it obvious?

331
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,500
He's my boss.

332
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,050
Do you like him?

333
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,850
Yeah.

334
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,510
I'm an avid reader of his works
for many years.

335
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,600
Of course I like him.

336
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,870
I'm not referring to that kind of liking.

337
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,010
Which kind were you referring to then?

338
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,270
It's the kind of liking

339
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,450
where you want

340
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,170
to have an unforgettable relationship

341
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,930
with him.

342
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,200
What are you saying?

343
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,930
I only admire him...

344
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,820
You should've told me earlier.

345
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,710
I could've

346
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,210
given you a push.

347
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,930
You would've succeeded by then.

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,480
I would've gotten into
a relationship long ago,

okay?

355
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,170
It's very simple.

356
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,440
You just don't have the guts to do it.

357

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
and suppress him!

687
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,840
This has nothing

688
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,390
to do with him.

689
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,880
Think about it.

690
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,580
I'm a retired athlete.

691
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,260
I didn't take any courses
related to my current profession,

692
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,390
and I didn't have any work experience.

693
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,600
I have no choice

694
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,140
but to tuck my tail
and start from the bottom.

695
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,800
You want me to be domineering?

696
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,970
If you're not doing well in your career,

697
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,170
you must do well in your relationships.

698
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,950
And, I have a feeling

699
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,150
that you're going
to get into a relationship soon.

700
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,370
Real soon.

701
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:42,990
Really?

702
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,810
Come on. I'll buy you a meal.

703
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,070
I want a feast!

704
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,420
It has to be a feast!

705
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,510
Spicy hot pot.

706
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,070
Spicy hot pot again?

707
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,040
I thought you just
received a lot of money?

708
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,600
That belongs to Xiao Wudi.

709
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,900
It has nothing to do with me.

710
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,490
The key is...

711
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,950
I'm craving spicy hot pot.

712
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,440
Where should I start?

713
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,050
Xiong, are you home?

714
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,700
Aunt An, give me a second.

715
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,570
Xiong.

716
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,750
Hello, Aunt An.

717
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,410
You haven't eaten yet, right?

718
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,320
I made extras.

719
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,200
I brought them here

720
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
so that you wouldn't need
to call for food deliveries.

721
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,360
It's delicious.

722
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,330
Xiong,

723
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,300
you said

724
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,770
you were a blind date consultant, right?

725
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,850
Yes, Aunt An.

726
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
That's what I've been doing lately.

727
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,750
If so, what do you think about

728
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,550
Nan Xing?

729
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,240
Aunt An, don't worry.

730
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,880
I've been looking for
a suitable candidate for her.

731
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,930
I'm sure I'll find

732
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,250
someone you'll like.

733
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,230
[Seems like there was
nothing between them.]

734
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,219
It's pretty hard to get it.

735
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,440
It's easier if you use a spoon.

736
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,580
My son did the same thing in the past.

737
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,380
He always scooped quail eggs for me.

738
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,310
You're just like

739
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,440
Xiaojun.

740
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,870
You enjoy my cooking

741
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,790
no matter

742
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,300
how terrible it is.

743
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,070
Aunt An,

744
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,150
when you referred to your son,

745
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,159
were you saying that
Nan Xing had an elder brother?

746
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,520
Didn't Nan Xing tell you

747
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,130
about our family before?

748
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,630
She did say something

749
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,440
about a car accident

750
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,239
that caused her

751
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,920
to lose someone important to her.

752
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,449
When I was in middle school,

753
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,780
I was trapped in a fire.

754
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,120
Since then,

755
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,590
I've been traumatized.

756
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,650
However, those people
who can relieve me of my trauma

757
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,910
are already gone.

758
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,620
Actually,

759
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,030
I'm not her biological mother.

760
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,080
Back then,

761
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,170
her family and our family

762
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,100
were neighbours for over a decade.

763
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,950
My son and I

764
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,540
were living opposite their house.

765
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,550
Nan Xing and her father

766
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,850
were staying here.

767
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,250
We had a great relationship.

768
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,970
After that,

769
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,280
Nan Xing's father and I...

770
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,440
But the three of them

771
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,970
were trapped in a fire

772
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,250
before our relationship was confirmed.

773
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,740
Since then,

774
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,880
I became her mother.

775
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,780
I guess

776
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,210
it was our silver lining.

777
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,470
God left behind

778
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
a daughter for me.

779
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,210
This house had been vacant

780
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,100
since then.

781
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,690
Nan Xing never let anyone

782
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,910
lived here.

783
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,230
Since she's allowing you to stay here,

784
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
that means you're important to her.

785
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,560
Look.

786
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,640
The atmosphere is getting too heavy here.

787
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,740
It's been so many years ago.

788
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,740
Let's drop the topic.

789
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,340
By the way,

790
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,220
I also brought some fruits for you.

791
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,780
I remember you said

792
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,670
you don't like oranges, right?

793
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,430
Aunt An, you actually remember that?

794
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,030
Thank you.

795
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,890
It's delicious.

796
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,860
[Nan Xing never let anyone]

797
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,910
[live here.]

798
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,550
[So,]

799
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,070
[since she's allowing you to stay here,]

800
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,200
[that means you're important to her.]

801
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
What do you think?

802
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,000
Mr. Xiao,

803
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,810
did you fall for me?

804
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,700
This girl is such a nuisance.

805
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,870
I've refunded the skirt.

806
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,860
This is the 2,000 yuan I've received.

807
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,140
Why am I so scared?

808
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,380
I just need to act normally.

809
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,900
I've refunded the skirt.

810
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,410
This is the 2,000 yuan I've received.

811
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,080
Take it.

812
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,230
Should I be more polite?

813
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,450
I've refunded the skirt.

814
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,740
This is the 2,000 yuan

815
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,620
I received.

816
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,800
Thank you.

817
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,120
Why should I thank him?

818
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,020
I should throw the money to his face.

819
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,160
Take your stupid money

820
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,820
and return to your stupid era!

821
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,600
I...

822
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,400
I...

823
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,810
You're done already?

824
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,070
[I guess my rehearsals were in vain.]

825
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,340
[Am I]

826
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,890
[important to her?]

827
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,590
[Is this guy still trying]

828
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,050
[to help me court my boss?]

829
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,540
[How can I make him give up?]

830
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,570
Don't tell me

831
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,550
you still want me to court my boss?

832
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,890
I will never court him

833
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,270
no matter what.

834
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,320
But why?

835
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,210
Could it be

836
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,030
that you've fallen for someone else?

837
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,900
[This seems like a good idea.]

838
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,520
Yeah.

839
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,120
I've fallen for someone else.

840
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,930
Who is it?

841
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,280
You...

842
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm too shy to tell you

843
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,270
about it.

844
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,620
Anyway,

845
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,240
you should stop

846
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,690
being my matchmaker.

847
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,300
So, she did fall for me.

848
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,440
I have to give this
some serious thought then.

849
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,320
Nan Xing,

850
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,880
do you want coffee?

851
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,020
Are you serious? Who can drink coffee
in the middle of the night?

852
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,030
Me.

853
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,270
I can sleep no matter what I drink.

854
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,890
You?

855
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
I'll get the door.

856
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,550
Coming.

857
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,700
Who is it?
