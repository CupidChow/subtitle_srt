Why did you run?

124

What were you trying to do?

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,330
What do you mean?

126
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,040
If I didn't save you in time,

127
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,570
Lu Zichen would've got you.

128
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,210
I said you misunderstood us!

He doesn't like me.

130
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,040
He likes someone else.

131
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,080
That's good to hear.

132
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
You can't like him too.

133
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,580
Why should I

134
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,570
get your permission to like someone?

135
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,170
He's not good enough for you!

136
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,770
What do you mean
he's not good enough for me?

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,020
He's just not good enough!

138
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,490
There's no reason at all!

139
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,760
You're talking nonsense.

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
He's so handsome.

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,210
Rich and famous.

142
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,130
How is he not good enough

143
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,130
for a nobody like me?

144
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,760
How are you a nobody?

145
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,290
Even if he's more famous

146
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,330
or richer than you,

147
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,370
it doesn't mean that

148
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,890
he's more worthy to be loved.

149
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,960
You're a good person.

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,420
You're not lower than him.

151
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,850
Look at you.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,730
Your looks

153
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,200
surpass him way more.

154
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,680
You...

155
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,440
You mean I'm beautiful?

156
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,890
I'm not saying that you're beautiful.

157
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,890
But you...

158
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm Young Master Hehuan.

159
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,850
I've seen countless beauties.

160
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,810
You look way below average face scores.

161
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,200
If you come to Hehuan Palace,

162
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,970
you can't even bathe me.

163
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,250
You said that I'm beautiful.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,610
That's because I meant

165
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,400
Lu Zichen prefers your type

166
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
because I've turned you

167
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
into his preference.

168
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
That's why he took the bait.

169
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,179
Do you think it's just you?

170
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,700
You look gorgeous!

171
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,200
So graceful and charming!

172
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,520
Perform well in front of Lu Zichen.

173
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,440
Trust yourself and trust me!

174
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,360
Xiao Wudi!

175
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I really thought that

176
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
you're sincerely helping me!

177
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
So you were just

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,380
helping yourself!

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,840
Besides, I've told you

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,360
so many times

181
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,160
that I don't feel for him that way!

182
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,890
You said you wouldn't lie to me.

185

I'll never

186
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,640
trust you anymore!

187
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
Why isn't she back yet?

188
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,120
Her coming back or not

189
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,380
is none of my business.

190
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,890

191
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,850
Is it you, Nan Xing?

192
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
Sorry for waking you up, mum.

193
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,810
Why are you so late tonight?

194
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,130
Hungry? I'll cook something for you.

195
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,590
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

196
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,010
Your high heels and dress...

197
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Doesn't look like me?

198
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,960
It doesn't feel right for you.

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
You're not used to it too, right?

200
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,080
Mum,

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,820
do you think I look beautiful?

202
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,050
Do you have to ask?

203
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,890
Of course you're beautiful.

204
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
My daughter

205
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,480
is the second most
beautiful woman in the world.

206
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,880
The most beautiful of all

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,640
is me, your mother.

208
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,560
I think

209
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,120
I look beautiful too.

210
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,890
But why

211
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,840
no boys

212
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,120
ever tell me so?

213
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,720
Not one at all?

214
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,980
How could it be?

215
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,480
No one at all?

216
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,400
Look at you.

217
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,360
Your looks

218
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,840
surpass him way more.

219
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,320
You...

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,040
You mean I'm beautiful?

221
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,920
There was one.

222
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,730
But he's a liar.

223
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,250
Don't mind if he's a liar.

224
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,120
At least there is one.

225
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,380
Alright.

226
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,780
Wash up and go to bed.

227
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,150
I'm going to take my beauty sleep.

Have you thought about
those who care about you?

Did I really fall in love with her?

00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,080
Come on.

347
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,400
Let out your steam.

348
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,900
You'll be fine by then.

349
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,840
I actually thought that

350
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,280
you were a kind person.

351
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,880
Turns out I was wrong about you.

352
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,260
That's it, stop thinking.

353
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,360
He's just a villain.

354
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
I was too dumb

355
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,360
to realise it.

356
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,570
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

357
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,210
Good morning.

358
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,920
You first.

359
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,250
Go ahead.

360
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,490
Hello?

361
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,730
You can go first.

362
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm coming.

363
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
Sorry, excuse me.

364
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,330
Okay, bye.

365
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,070
Are you guys coming in?

366
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,840
Yes, we are.

367
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,080
What floor?

368
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,090
24, thank you.

369
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,560
You?

370
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,970
24.

371
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,900
[What to do?]

372
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,530
[Does he remember]

373
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,130
[what happened yesterday?]

374
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,170
[I hope he went blank.]

375
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,410
[Lu Zichen]

376
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,850
[Nothing happened]

377
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,840
[yesterday.]

378
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,240
[Don't tell anyone.]

379
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,950
[Nan Xing]

380
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,880
[Okay.]

381
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,450
[Especially Miss Ye.]

382
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,470
[Lu Zichen]

383
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,530
[Nan Xing]

384
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,450
[Yes, Mr. Lu.]

385
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,530
[Remember, it's a secret.]

386
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,100
[Lu Zichen]

387
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,610
How long have you two been together?

388
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,650
Marriage proposal?

389
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,250
I've spent time with Ye Qing.

390
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,330
I really think that

391
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,460
she's the one I want.

392
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,960
I want to propose to her
as soon as possible.

393
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,850
Song Jiaming.

394
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,010
You didn't ask her, did you?

395
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,840
Ye Qing.

396
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,970
I have an idea.

397
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,250
You know that

398
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,200
my company focuses on

399
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,290
suspense and mystery novels.

400
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,950
If we add some sci-fi elements

401
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,440
in Zichen's novels...

402
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,650
Were you...

403
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,800
Were you about to say something to me?

404
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,970
It's fine, carry on.

405
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,130
Or you've said it?

406
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,920
Were you...

407
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,130
Were you about to say something to me?

408
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,680
Ye Qing.

409
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Will you marry me?

410
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,590
Let me take care of you.

411
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,330
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,170
I'm not ready.

413
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,530
Or did she say yes?

414
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Will you marry me?

415
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,780
Let me take care of you.

416
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,360
Did you pop up the question or not?

417
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,210
[Let the essence from the seaweed]

418
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,170
[moisturise your skin.]

419
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,930
I actually thought that

420
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,410
you were a kind person.

421
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,820
Turns out I was wrong about you.

422
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,570
I'm Xiao Wudi.

423
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,450
I know

424
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,600
my character.

425
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,420
There's nothing you can say about it.

426
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,730
Why am I not a kind person?

427
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,090
What are you looking at?

428
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,580
You want to say something?

429
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,650
Let me tell you.

430
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,600
I'm doing this for her own good.

431
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,320
How did I lie to her?

432
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,760
Even if I lied to her,

433
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:15,890
so what?

434
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,920
Should I, Young Master Hehuan,

435
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,290
apologise to her?

436
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,480
That's impossible!

437
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,840
[Keep it a secret.]

438
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,400
[What if I fail to do so?]

439
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,160
[Will he silence me?]

440
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,960
[What if I accidentally]

441
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,180
[spill the beans?]

442
00:23:59,410 --> 00:23:59,940
[I guess]

443
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,940
[I'll keep my mouth shut at work.]

444
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,000
Men are so troublesome.

445
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,770
Men?

446
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,810
What is it?

447
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,920
Are men difficult?

448
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,720
What's wrong?

449
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,560
What's wrong?

450
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,370
What's the matter?

451
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,170
What's the situation?

452
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,920
Are you guys not busy today?

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,970
No, we're not.

454
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm bored by work these days.

455
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,290
Which man troubled you?

456
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,930
Nan Xing.

457
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,370
Tell us.

458
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,680
Let me have a laugh.

459
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,560
No.

460
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,320
I was talking nonsense.

461
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,410
You have a boyfriend?

462
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,960
Who is it? How did you know him?

463
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,370
Be honest.

464
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,610
It's impossible.

465
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,490
Nan Xing has been slogging off.

466
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,020
How did she get time to date?

467
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,160
That's right.

468
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,490
Mr. Lu worked overtime yesterday.

469
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,810
Nan Xing was with him.

470
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,090
So it's Mr Lu?

471
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,080
Did something happen

472
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,210
between you and Mr. Lu?

473
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,440
No!

474
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,120
-That's right!
-There's no way.

475
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,530
Don't spout nonsense, Yufan.

476
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,410
What if Miss Ye hears you?

477
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,340
You'll be fired.

478
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
Nan Xing, is it really Mr. Lu?

479
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,740
It is Mr. Lu!

480
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,290
Oh my God! This is such a big news!

481
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,090
Oh my gosh!

482
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,010
I have a call.

483
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,730
Hello?

484
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,610
[Come on out.]

485
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,360
[I'm by the reception.]

486
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,330
Come on out? Why you...

487
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,800
Come on out?

488
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,610
Okay, wait for me.

489
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm going out.

490
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,170
What is it, Nan Xing?

491
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,290
I bet a hundred on Mr. Lu!

492
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,760
Why are you here?

493
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,460
I walked past by coincidence.

494
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,010
Let's go eat.

495
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,170
Who wants to eat with you?

496
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,210
I told you.

497
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,140
I won't believe

498
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,620
anything you say anymore.

499
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,280
It's just a meal.

500
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,920
I won't sell you away.

501
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,370
Who knows?

502
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,090
What if you do?

503
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,680
I might still need to
count the money for you.

504
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,880
Don't think too much.

505
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,610
Follow me.

506
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,760
I'm not going.

507
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,530
Wait.

508
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
What should I do with this?

509
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,120
What is it?

510
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,920
Last night.

511
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,530
The surveillance footage of
you and Lu Zichen.

512
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,810
[Mr. Lu worked overtime yesterday.]

513
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,090
Nan Xing was with him.

514
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,370
So it's Mr. Lu?

515
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,360
Did something happen

516
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,450
between you and Mr. Lu?

517
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,000
No!

518
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,960
-That's right!
-There's no way.

519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,600
Let's go!

520
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,720
Hello.

521
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,680
Please have a look at what you want.

522
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,280
Thank you.

523
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,170
Thank you.

524
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,770
Let me know when you're done.

525
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,520
Take a look at what you want to eat.

526
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,810
Alright.

527
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,650
I'll give this back to you.

528
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,600
I don't need it anyway.

529
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,890
You must've left a copy.

530
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,850
This is the only one.

531
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,600
Impossible.

532
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
I won't believe you.

533
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,880
[What is he trying to do?]

534
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,050
I, Xiao Wudi, swear.

535
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,040
If I lie to you again today,

536
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,660
I'll never return to
Hehuan Palace forever.

537
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,570
[Is this counted as an apology?]

538
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
[Ancient men are troublesome as well.]

539
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,870
You really didn't keep a copy?

540
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,810
I, Xiao Wudi, swear.

541
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,760
If I kept a copy...

542
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,730
That's enough.

543
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,570
I'll trust you one more time.

544
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,360
Sit down.

545
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
[I didn't lie this time.]

546
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,530
[But how can you trust my oath?]

547
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,050
[As expected from the stupid bear.]

548
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,600
I'm so hungry.

549
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,210
Hurry and take a look.

550
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,170
Order whatever you want.

551
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,920
Pizza.

552
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,410
No way.

553
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,600
The prices are unreasonable.

554
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,160
Waiter!

555
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,400
Hello, may I take your order?

556
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,720
I'll have a Margherita pizza.

557
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,360
Okay.

558
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,880
A sausage platter.

559
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,410
Okay.

560
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,530
Mushroom and cheese risotto.

561
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay.

562
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,260
And one chicken Caesar salad.

563
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,610
Okay.

564
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,930
Do you want some dessert?

565
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,130
Sure.

566
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,040
How about ice cream?

567
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,280
I've never had ice cream before.

568
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,690
You've never had one?

569
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,240
So pitiful.

570
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,850
Ice creams are so delicious.

571
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,800
Since I came here,

572
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,880
there are many things I haven't tried.

573
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Ice cream.

574
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,240
And the newly released

575
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,690
escape room.

576
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,120
That looks interesting too.

577
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,650
Give it to me, I'll order it.

578
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,530
This is so expensive.

579
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,980
Let's get it at the convenience store.

580
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,600
It's cheaper and delicious.

581
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:46,810
Wait.

582
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,090
Hello? Sisi.

583
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,080
[Senior, I need your help.]

584
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,760
[Are you occupied tonight?]

585
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,290
Tonight?

586
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,640
No, why?

587
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,370
[Let's have dinner.]

588
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,540
[Someone's treat.]

589
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,610
[Hao's brother came back from overseas.]

590
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,120
[He asked us out for dinner.]

591
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,650
[So I said I'll ask you too.]

592
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,770
He's just asking you out.

593
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,200
I don't want to be a third wheel.

594
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
[Don't say that.]

595
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,170
[But his brother is really handsome.]

596
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,570
Handsome?

597
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,690
How handsome? Can you guarantee?

598
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,480
Alright. I'll be there tonight.

599
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,120
[Okay.]

600
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,920
[We'll go to the]

601
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,760
[barbecue restaurant.]

602
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,560
[7pm tonight.]

603
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,090
Okay, see you tonight. Bye!

604
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,360
Who's handsome?

605
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,200
Hao's brother.

606
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,090
So you guys are going

607
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,360
on a blind date?

608
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,590
How can this count as a blind date?

609
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,130
I'm just meeting a new friend.

610
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,520
Two boys and two girls.

611
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,810
That's a blind date.

612
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,620
What do you want again?

613
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,890
If you're going on a blind date,

614
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,570
then I'll wish you good luck.

615
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,010
When you're done,

616
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,640
I can go back sooner.

617
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,090
As if.

618
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,720
Almost time to work.

619
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,330
I have to go now.

620
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,100
I'm warning you.

621
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Stop causing me

622
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,840
any trouble.

623
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,570
Especially not

624
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,770
implicating my boss.

625
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,400
We'll eat ice cream next time.

626
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,850
Bye!

627
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,930
A blind date?

628
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,700
[The Great Lu]

629
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,040
Nan Xing, come here.

630
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,410
Mr...

631
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,840
Come in.

632
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,400
Mr. Lu.

633
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,520
May I help you with anything?

634
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,210
Go

635
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,690
and check something for me.

636
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,320
Okay.

637
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,600
What is it?

638
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,200
Find out for me

639
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,450
if Miss Ye was being proposed.

640
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,330
See if she said yes.

641
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,240
This is my job scope too?

642
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,930
You are my personal assistant.

643
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,040
Solving my problems

644
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
is your job scope.

645
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,160
Okay, I'll check it out.

646
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,280
But, Mr. Lu.

647
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,180
I don't think

648
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,490
this is the problem.

649
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,750
Just send her a text

650
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,680
if you want to know.

651
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,410
That will do.

652
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,250
Why should you

653
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,330
take such a turn?

654
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,120
I might not have experience in love,

655
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,250
but I do know about this.

656
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,170
If you like someone,

657
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,930
you must be brave to

658
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,130
face your affection.

659
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,400
If you're a coward,

660
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,040
you should just give up.

661
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,920
I wasn't referring to you.

662
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,040
I was referring to your friend.

663
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,890
I know.

664
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,500
What do you normally play?

665
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,970
Sisi.

666
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,850
Let's go and watch a movie

667
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,620
after our training tomorrow.

668
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,720
Your brother is 25 years old?

669
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,170
That's great.

670
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,850
It's a romantic movie.

671
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,930
I heard about the reviews.

672
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,060
So I bought the tickets right away.

673
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,330
Will your brother leave the country?

674
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,120
How long will he stay this time?

675
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,330
He will, why?

676
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,520
Sisi, we can grab some pizza

677
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,360
after the movies too.

678
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,620
Didn't you say that

679
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,610
you like pizza?

680
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,960
I found a restaurant

681
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,840
and tried it out myself.

682
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,770
It's delicious.

683
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,600
Not bad at all.

684
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,450
Ask your brother along then.

685
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,440
Let him join us.

686
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,700
We'll go together.

687
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,400
My brother is busy.

688
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,400
Why did you put it back?

689
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,640
It is my favourite.

690
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,320
Why did you keep placing it back?

691
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,330
Sisi, this...

692
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,810
This is really fat.

693
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,010
You shouldn't eat it.

694
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,890
It's not good for you.

695
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,000
I like it.

696
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,610
You keep throwing it back in.

697
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,450
What do I eat then?

698
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,090
That's all.

699
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,840
The coach will...

700
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,440
That's it.

701
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,410
Cook them up.

702
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,360
Hurry along!

703
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,890
Okay.

704
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,000
Since we just got to know each other,

705
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,120
let's have some alcohol.

706
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,380
Sure, let's have some.

707
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
I'll go and grab some.

708
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,010
Nan Xing.

709
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
I heard from Hao

710
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,240
that you work for a publishing house.

711
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,500
What is your position?

712
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm the President's assistant.

713
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,720
President's assistant?

714
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Then you must

715
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,450
have to entertain a lot.

716
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,050
Not much.

717
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,930
Your skewers are ready.

718
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,860
Thank you, Boss.

719
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,940
Enjoy yourselves.

720
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,170
Your boss must be really popular.

721
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,679
Does he have many interviews?

722
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,210
Not much.

723
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,840
May I help you?

724
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,370
Not much.

725
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,239
Will you join him

726
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,500
on various functions?

727
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,690
Not much.

728
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,179
What do you actually do?

729
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,770
[He is asking such detailed questions.]

730
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,770
[And she said it's not a blind date?]

731
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,400
Boss.

732
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,639
I'll help you out.

733
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,600
Thank you.

734
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,820
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

735
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,010
You're really drinking?

736
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,610
You're goners.

737
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,530
She's our team's master drinker.

738
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,400
Really?

739
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,650
Don't listen to him.

740
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,560
Come, I shall

741
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,980
accompany you tonight.

742
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,639
Cheers.

743
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,719
Thank you, seniors.

744
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,489
Cheers!

745
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,640
[What is a blind date if this is not?]

746
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,620
[They're drinking alcohol.]

747
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,080
What do you work as?

748
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,960
I was a sportsman before.

749
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,620
However,

750
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,060
I'm now a photographer.

751
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,650
That's amazing.

752
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,530
[What's amazing about it?]

753
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,240
[I'll show you what's amazing.]

754
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,210
The photo has great effect.

755
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,640
Boss, their skewers are ready.

756
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,040
Okay.

757
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,490
Boss, are our skewers done?

758
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,080
Right away!

759
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,450
Okay.

760
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,270
These ones?

761
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,200
Okay, thanks.

762
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,290
Come on, stop looking.

763
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,290
Help yourselves.

764
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,280
What is this? Pigskin?

765
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,330
What's wrong?

766
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,490
Hao.

767
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,160
Brother, Nan Xing.

768
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,600
There's a pool table.

769
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,050
Shall we play?

770
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,690
Pool?

771
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,440
Sure! I'm good at playing pool.

772
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,880
Let's go.

773
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,560
But I'm not that good.

774
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,620
I'll teach you.

775
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,280
Sure.

776
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,560
Pool is really easy.

777
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,420
You can do it if you have hands.

778
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,450
How do we play?

779
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,240
Why not we split teams?

780
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,160
I'll be with Sisi.

781
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,840
I'll be with Shenghao.

782
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:20,810
Okay.

783
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,370
You're our new friend, Shenghao.

784
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,160
You can start the match.

785
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
But I'm not good at it.

786
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,830
I'll teach you.

787
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,320
Okay.

788
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,690
First,

789
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,480
you place your left hand like this.

790
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,160
Form it into a rack.

791
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,160
Here, place it here.

792
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,120
Lighter.

793
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,770
Not bad.

794
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,200
You're good.

795
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,440
I'll continue then.

796
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,170
Please.

797
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,720
It's fine.

798
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,170
We'll let them take a turn.

799
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:53,700
Go ahead.

800
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
[If you like someone,]

801
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,160
[you must be brave to]

802
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,290
[face your affection.]

803
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,440
If you're a coward,

804
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,050
you should just give up.

805
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,500
Why are you still here?

806
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,050
Have you eaten?

807
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,480
No.

808
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,850
Join me.

809
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,730
Come.

810
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,410
Something's up?

811
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,880
Yes.

812
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,810
What is it?

813
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,290
I have a question.

814
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,810
What is it?

815
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,530
I...

816
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,360
Where's your necklace?

817
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,800
I gave it back.

818
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,880
Gave it back?

819
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,690
Why?

820
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,920
I have to give it back after the breakup.

821
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,000
Breakup?

822
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,500
You broke up with Song Jiaming?

823
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,250
Yes.

824
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,990
He's a nice person.

825
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,800
But we're not suitable for each other.

826
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,120
That's such a pity.

827
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,930
Hello?

828
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Okay, no problem.

829
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,300
What were you trying to say?

830
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,490
It's nothing.

831
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:37,880
Eat up.

832
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,920
I'll pass.

833
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,920
Chocolate.

834
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,900
You scared me!

835
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,940
You can't hide from what's coming.

836
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,210
Just face it!

837
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:15,920
I can just

838
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,930
look for a new job.

839
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,730
Hello? Mr. Lu?

840
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,480
They broke up.

841
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,650
What did you say?

842
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,790
[Who broke up?]

843
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,530
Miss Ye broke up with her boyfriend.

844
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,690
[Thank you.]

845
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,800
Why do you thank me?

846
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,730
I... I mean my friend.

847
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,610
He has never dated anyone.

848
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,520
So he doesn't

849
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,890
understand girls at all.

850
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,570
He's clueless about many things too.

851
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,450
But your words encouraged him.

852
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,730
[So, thank you.]

853
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,400
He's counting on you.

854
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,560
Mr. Lu!

855
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,760
I'm clueless as well.

856
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,490
You can't...

857
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,520
What kind of work is this?

858
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,440
Our boss

859
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,560
is nothing like his book.

860
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,720
He's not cool at all.

861
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,920
He's shy to confess to the girl he likes.

862
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,600
He's so thrilled when they break up too.

863
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,090
He can be happy for all he wants.

864
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,120
Why must he tell me?

865
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,640
Mister.

866
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,770
I'm your assistant.

867
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,320
Not your bosom friend.

868
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,520
[Look at the time, she's not back yet.]

869
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,120
[Why isn't she back at this hour?]

870
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,050
[Is she coming back or not?]

871
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,250
Xiao Wudi!

872
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,810
Xiao Wudi!

873
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,760
Xiao Wudi!

874
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,000
[Must I open the door]

875
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
[whenever you ask me to?]

876
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,680
Xiao Wudi!

877
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,330
Xiao Wudi!

878
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,020
Xiao Wudi!

879
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,650
[Fine.]

880
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,810
[I'll see]

881
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,950
[what you're up to.]

882
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,720
What is it?

883
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,960
Didn't you go on

884
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,240
an enjoyable blind date?

885
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,170
Why are you here?

886
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,410
I bought ice cream for you.

887
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm telling you.

888
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,730
Buying you ice cream

889
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,690
doesn't mean that I've forgiven you.

890
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,960
I'm just

891
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,890
pitying someone

892
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,970
who have never tried ice cream before.

893
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,090
Besides, I promised

894
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,200
to buy ice cream

895
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,220
for you at the convenience store.

896
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,250
In addition

897
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,840
to the expensive lunch we had

898
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
at the restaurant in the afternoon.

899
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,040
You are rich.

900
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,250
But you shouldn't be extravagant.

901
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,200
You can't

902
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,090
spend all you have.

903
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,530
Understand?

904
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,950
I'll open it up for you.

905
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:11,690
Eat up.

906
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,120
This ice cream

907
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,490
has melted so much.

908
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,530
How can I eat it?

909
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,120
You can still eat it even if it melts.

910
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,160
Fine.

911
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,530
I'll do it myself.

912
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,480
Delicious?

913
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,280
♫ Waiting for someone's expectation ♫

914
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,170
Yes.

915
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,650
You should take a bigger bite
if it's delicious.

916
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,060
♫ I guess right now
your heart flutters too ♫

917
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,720
If not, it'll melt away.

918
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,400
Look.

919
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,210
I'll eat it for you.

920
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,700
♫ Still uneasy as we inch closer ♫

921
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,520
I've eaten it just now.

922
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,390
♫ This scenario is not what I expected ♫

923
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,730
But I want to eat it too.

924
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,160
♫ Waiting to make a wish ♫

925
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,540
♫ I guess right now you're willing too ♫

926
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:20,270
♫ Everyday with more
getting used to and reliance ♫

927
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,860
♫ I hear heartbeats racing ♫

928
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,000
♫ Tell me why ♫
