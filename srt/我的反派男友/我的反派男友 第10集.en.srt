[Mr. Bad]

3
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,250
Did I summon you again?

5
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,580
I...

6
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,259
I know.

7
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,479
I know you don't like being summoned.

8
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,060
Your actions will be interrupted

9
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,660
whenever I summon you.

10
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,220
I know I'm being too much.

11
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,700
But this time,

12
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,090
I want to ask you out.

13
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,979
Before this, you said

14
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,380
you wanted to play room escape games,

15
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,530
right?

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,810
I didn't expect you to be this angry.

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,810
I wouldn't have asked you out
if I knew this would happen.

18
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,820
I'm not angry.

19
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,620
Do I look like

20
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,150
someone easily irritable?

21
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,169
You've been angry

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,660
since yesterday.

23
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,530
I wasn't angry.

24
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,130
I...

25
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,620
Forget it. You won't understand me anyway.

26
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,090
Let's go then.

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,820
I thought we were going to
play room escape games?

28
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,410
Everyone is here.

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,900
Hello.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,270
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,030
Let's go.

32
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,060
Go on.

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,910
In front of us. The door is open.

34
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,500
There's no one here.

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,020
Come on.

36
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,040
Hush

37
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,230
Hush

38
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,400
Close the door.

39
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,710
Close the door.

40
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
Let's look for clues.

41
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,300
Let's look for some clues.

42
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,650
There's a box over there.

43
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,740
Hold the door!

44
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm holding it!

45
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,030
We're done!

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,220
Is it open?

47
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,040
We're done.

48
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,930
Split into teams.

49
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,170
Split into teams?

50
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,340
I'll form a team with Sisi.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,180
Xiao Wudi and I will form a team then.

52
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,710
Let's go.

53
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,190
Let's go.

54
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,780
Xiao Wudi, let's go.

55
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,470
Let's go.

56
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,550
Why is it so dark over here?

57
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,260
Are you okay?

58
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,520
Is it over here?

59
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,100
Please follow the clues in the picture

60
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,490
and prove that you aren't infected

61
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,140
within the time limit.

62
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,940
If you can prove yourself

63
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,100
within the time limit,

64
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,170
you will be released.

65
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,300
If you fail,

66
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,780
you will be shot.

67
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,880
Let's learn that move.

68
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,340
The first one. Come on.

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,070
We need to press the button.

70
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,140
We passed.

71
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,270
The second one.

72
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,180
It's fine. Let's do it again.

73
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,590
The third one is simple.

74
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,110
You need to bend your knees.

75
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,190
Alright.

76
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,790
The last one.

77
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,520
We just need to hug each other.

78
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,860
What's wrong?

79
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,500
Are we hugging just like that?

80
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,390
What's wrong with a hug?

81
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,130
Let's do it.

82
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,980
Are we really doing it like this?

83
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,140
How else will you do it?

84
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,340
Do you want me to sing while hugging you?

85
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,460
That's not it.

86
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,140
You see, I'm a guy, and you're a girl.

87
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,180
How could we

88
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,820
hug each other so casually?

89
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,140
I thought

90
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,580
you were a shy girl?

91
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,780
We're great friends, aren't we?

92
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,909
What's wrong with hugging each other?

93
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,460
Do you wish to get out or not?

94
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,530
That's not it.

95
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,909
What's the matter with you?

96
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,980
Why do I feel like

97
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
you've been weird lately?

98
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,580
How am I weird?

99
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,690
You were acting weird.

100
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,460
You were

101
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,850
very awkward.

102
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,530
Sometimes,

103
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,390
I feel like you're angry at me.

104
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,360
But sometimes,

105
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,650
I don't feel that way.

106
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,140
You're completely different

107
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,210
from the past you.

108
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,430
If it was in the past,

109
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,740
you would've said something like this.

110
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,860
I, Young Master Hehuan,

111
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,820
is not someone

112
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,580
who cares about red tape.

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
It is improper for men and women
to touch each other, huh?

114
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,210
I will kiss her anyway.

115
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,260
That's the past you.

116
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,770
You're making it as if

117
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,940
I was a lecher.

118
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,930
That's not what I mean.

119
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,780
You were straightforward last time.

120
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,570
But now,

121
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,050
you're acting like a middle school student

122
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,180
who has a crush on someone else.

123
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,730
Do you actually have a crush on someone?

124
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,740
This can't be.

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,940
Don't tell me I was right?

126
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,620
Who is it? Do I know her?

127
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,650
Which area is she living in? What unit?

128
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,780
Which house is she living at?
Is she good-looking?

129
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,060
Hey, stop it.

130
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
I understand now.

131
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,540
You don't dare to hug me

132
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,860
because you're afraid
that she'll be jealous.

133
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,980
What a joke.

134
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,050
I am Xiao Wudi.

135
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,620
Why would I be afraid of a woman?

136
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,370
I was right!

137
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,230
You do have a crush on someone.

138
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,300
Am I right?

139
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I was just saying.

140
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,620
I didn't expect

141
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,280
to hit the nail on the head.

142
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,230
[That's right.]

143
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,750
[I do have a crush on someone.]

144
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,780
[I have a crush]

145
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,820
[on you.]

146
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,260
The door is open!

147
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,820
That was exciting.

148
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,460
Listen,

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,380
I've never played

150
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,420
such an exciting game before.

151
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,860
Listen,

152
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,170
I was almost scared to death.

153
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,570
Yeah.

154
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,580
The corner

155
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,540
was terrifying.

156
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,140
You two are so slow.

157
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,610
You two only reached the ending

158
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,860
after such a long time.

159
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,170
It was too difficult.

160
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,700
I don't want to play this again.

161
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,250
It's all your fault.

162
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,460
Senior, it's not difficult at all.

163
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,220
Next time, we...

164
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,500
[She didn't find out?]

165
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,250
[She actually didn't find out.]

166
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,870
[It's no wonder she was single
for such a long time.]

167
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,620
It's beautiful!

168
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,970
Look over there!

169
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,700
That one.

170
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,140
Xiao Wudi,

171
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,200
do you feel happier today?

172
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,930
I guess.

173
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,690
Great.

174
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,610
I knew I was smart.

175
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,770

Xiao Wudi, let's see who gets home first!

177
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,210
Mum, I'm back.

178
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,500
You're back?

179
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,610
Mum.

180
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,340
What's the good news?
Why are you smiling to yourself?

181
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,700
Do I need a reason to smile?

182
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,450
I was planning to ask you

183
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,980
why you stopped writing

184
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,110
that novel of yours.

185
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,780
I've been busy with work lately.

186
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,090
I don't have time to write it.

187
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,130
I loved it.

188
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,500
Are you sure you're going to stop?

189
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,540
Yeah.

190
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,420
And, I found out

191
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,940
that once I've gotten
more familiar with my boss,

192
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,050
I could no longer write

193
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,130
my fantasies about him.

194
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,340
If you can't fantasize about him,

195
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,380
you can fantasize about someone else.

196
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,370
Who else can I fantasize about?

197
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,090
What about Xiong?

198
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,480
He's right over there.

199
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,410
No way.

200

Why not?

201
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,410
It won't work.

203
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,570
I think he's fine.

204

please stop asking me that.

382
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,100
I know nothing.

383
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,370
If I knew what to do,

384
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:50,940
I wouldn't have stayed single

385

386
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,520
At the very least, you're a woman.

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,160
You understand her better
than a man like me.

What about this?

389
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,740
You should persist

and create more chances.

391
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,050

eventually.

393

I don't know about ordinary people.

But that's what they do in novels.

I know.

398
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,290
I won't tell anyone about it.

his answers slightly.

A village? That's great!

500

The government is promoting
rural construction nowadays.

And,

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,900
are still normal neighbours?

516
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,740
The relationship

517
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,220
is still the same, right?

518
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,700
Of course.

519
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,150
He's just my neighbour.

520
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,620
He was just passing by.

521
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,740
That's great.

522
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,780
If that's the case,

523
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,500
that means other people
still have a chance, right?

524
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,220
Miss Jiao, have some shrimp.

525
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,120
What nonsense are you saying?

526
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,980
Am I

527
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,980
overthinking it?

528
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,300
You see, Nan Xing

529
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,000
has improved a lot lately.

530
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,020
Our boss

531
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,210
even asked me about Nan Xing

532
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,490
when I delivered some documents

533
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,940
to him.

534
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,210
The boss is actually
concerned about someone?

535
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,140
That's pretty rare.

536
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,940
That's right.

537
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,570
I was dumbfounded back then.

538
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,820
Nan Xing, you're amazing.

539
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,130
It's only been a few days,

540
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,220
but your relationship with our boss

541
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,700
has changed drastically.

542
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,900
Miss Jiao, be careful.

543
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,620
Were you hurt?

544
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,190
-I spilled the drink.
-Don't get it on your shirt.

545
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,390
It's okay no problem.

546
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,290
Your leg.

547
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,620
It's soaked.

548
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,450
Did you choke?

549
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,500
Come here.

550
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,560
Hurry, wipe it off.

551
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,530
Over here.

552
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,210
My leg.

553
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,180
It's on my leg.

554
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,890
Chu, get us more tissues.

555
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,100
Okay.

556
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,300
Be careful. It's very hot.

557
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,420
Is your shirt dirty?

558
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,260
My shirt is fine.

559
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,720
Goodness, it's dripping.

560
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,430
They came out

561
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,260
to interfere with their colleague's lunch

562
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,210
during lunch break

563
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,070
instead of staying at the office.

564
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,170
Is our society even governed by the law?

565
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,850
If this was Hehuan Palace,

566
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,980
I would've burned her to death.

567
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,770
What's with the rage?

568
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,700
What rage?

569
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,700
I'm a generous person.

570
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,390
How could I rage at someone?

571
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,860
Mr. Xiao,

572
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,570
we'll return to work now.

573
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,540
See you next time.

574
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,910
Goodbye.

575
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,540
Goodbye.

576
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,270
Goodbye.

577
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,900
Goodbye.

578
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,090
Goodbye. See you.

579
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,390
I'll also head back now.

580
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,060
Wait.

581
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,620
I'm free tonight.

582
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,210
Let's go and play

583
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,910
the escape room game again.

584
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,860
Tonight?

585
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,740
Initially,

586
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,300
I had something to do in the afternoon.

587
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,940
In the end, I ended up
having lunch with you.

588
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,060
That's why I plan

589
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,020
to take my time and do it tonight.

590
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,340
Did you forget

591
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,930
what you said last night?

592
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,600
[Nan Xing]

593
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,210
[Sure.]

594
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,370
[Your wishes will be fulfilled.]

595
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,590
Can you please let me off this time?

596
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,980
Fine, I promise you.

597
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,820
You would've pestered me until I said yes

598
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,420
even if I rejected you.

599
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,820
However, this time,

600
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,570
don't bring Xiong Sisi
and her boyfriend along.

601
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,940
They're too dumb.

602
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,930
We're not on the same level.

603
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,650
The two of us will go there by ourselves.

604
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,450
Alright.

605
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,590
I'll return to work now.

606
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,220
[You should create more chances.]

607
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,010
[She'll realize it eventually.]

608
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,940

609
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,690
we've come up with.

610
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,090
Okay.

611
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,210
We'll talk about this later.

612
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,690
Boss, take a look at this.

613
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,540
Boss.

614
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,760
Great timing. This is...

615
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,540
We'll talk about this later.

616
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,020
Boss?

617
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,840
Boss, can I discuss

618
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,230
this document with you?

619
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,580
Morning, Miss Ye.

620
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,110
Morning.

621
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,290
Why are you out of breath?

622
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,620
By the way,

623
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,980
I have something to ask you.

624
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,500
The artist you mentioned last time,

625
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,360
he told me that he didn't know you.

626
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,170
He only appeared at the pop-up shop

627
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,100
because his flight was cancelled.

628
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,870
I thought you were going

629
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,140
to introduce us to each other?

630
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,940
That's not it.

631
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,270
If so, why did you ask me out?

632
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,630
We're just there to view the paintings,

633
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,260
since you like them so much.

634
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,570
Is that all?

635
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,740
Yeah.

636
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,390
If you're interested in it,

637
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,210
I'll update you

638

639
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,420

Hi, handsome hunk.

642
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,100
What a coincidence.

643
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,020
Not at all.

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,300
[This isn't it, right?]

689
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,570
[How did it end up like this?]

690
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,610
Where's the lock?

691
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,330
It's over there.

692
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,820
Chicken, goat, rat, monkey, pig.

693
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,650
It's correct.

694
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,370
You can unlock it.

695
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,330
It's unlocked.

696
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,699
[Here's my chance.]

697
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,699
It's fine.

698
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,670
Don't be scared. It's fake.

699
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,830
Don't be scared.

700
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,940
It's fake.

701
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,860
Everything is fake.

702
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,170
The sign.

703
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,830
Do we put it here?

704
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,410
[Female player, please wear a blindfold.]

705
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,580
[The male player shall direct her]

706
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,220
[in conquering the stage.]

707
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,610
[A huge reward]

708
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,490
[will be waiting for you two
after the mission is completed.]

709
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,500
[A huge reward?]

710
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,780
[Could it be]

711
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,930
[that we need to hug each other again
to complete the mission?]

712
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,180
[Here's another chance.]

713
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,840
Let's do it.

714
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,180
Mister, you're so anxious.

715
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,180
Let me play

716
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,460
a game with you.

717
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,060
Xiao Wudi, where am I going?

718
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
She's going back.

719
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,990
I'll catch you!

720
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,540
It's a different person now.

721
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,450
Xiao Wudi, where should I go?

722
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,510
Toward your right.

723
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,300
He's in front of you.

724
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,180
He's behind you.

725
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,850
Bottom!

726
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,780
Kick him!

727
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,170
Turn around!

728
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,850
I caught you!

729
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,020
I caught him!

730
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,680
You passed.

731
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,300
Mister, you're amazing.

732
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,330
You caught me within seconds.

733
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,220
I'm going

734
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,970
to give you a special reward.

735
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,580
Please accept my flying kiss.

736
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,410
Kiss my foot!

737
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,340
Let's go!

738
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,860
Xiao Wudi,

739
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,450
what's wrong?

740
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,130
Wasn't it pretty fun?

741
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,300
You think it's fun?

742
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,940
This room escape game is boring.

743
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,380
It's not as fun as the previous one.

744
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,710
Let's play another one.

745
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,460
Another one?

746
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,010
I have something to do today.

747
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,740
Why don't we play it some other day?

748
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,270
Why don't you play it alone?

749
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,380
Play it alone?

750
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,980
What's the point of that?

751
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,940
But it was boring

752
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,600
even when we played together.

753
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,860
[This is boring]

754
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,430
[because it doesn't
have a hugging segment.]

755
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:28,860
Enough.

756
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,010
You can play it by yourself.

757
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,820
I'll pay for it.

758
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,780
It's my treat.

759
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,450
Original

760
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,660
and not published before?

761
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,730
Can I actually do it?

762
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,910
All those comments below my post

763
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,300
were negative ones.

764
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,300
Don't be so quick

765
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,560
in doubting yourself.

766
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,140
Although Hero Lu

767
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,920
has

768
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,180
no lofty ambitions,

769
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,020
his relationship with Nan Xiaoxing

770
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,950
is very genuine.

771
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,940
I love

772
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,530
their interactions.

773
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,380
I do expect great things

774
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,910
from your

775
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,290
new stories.

776
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,510
I think you should participate in it.

777
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,620
Alright then. I'll give it a try.

778
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,540
But what should I write?

779
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,460
What should I write about?

780
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,070
I should go and take a walk.

781
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,920
Maybe I'll be inspired

782
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,900
during my walk.

783
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,700
[What other stories can I write?]

784
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,360
[The only things I've written before
are fan fictions.]

785
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,620
[It's all your fault.]

786
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,070
[It's all because of your stupid summon.]

787
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,620
[An unforgettable relationship?]

788
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,170
[This is]

789
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,650
[unforgettable for me.]

790
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,630
[But she's nonchalant about it.]

791
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,840
[What kind of relationship is this?]

792
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,940
I have to listen to her demands

793
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
while she can

794
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,460
ignore mine?

795
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Is this even fair?

796
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,630
Is this even fair?

797
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,100
What gives?

798
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,770
Xiao Wudi?

799
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,750
What are you doing here?

800
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,240
What's unfair?

801
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,920
What were you talking about?

802
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,860
Didn't you say

803
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,040
you were busy?

804
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,880
I'm busy.

805
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,400
I'm racking my brain right now.

806
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,610
With your intellect,

807
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,310
I guess you can never figure it out.

808
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,110
Just tell me

809
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,540
what's on your mind.

810
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,850
What's the point?

811
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,530
I should be able to figure it out

812
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,500
after taking a walk in the cold weather.

813
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,360
What do you mean

814
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,730
by that?

815
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,370
Just tell me. What's the matter?

816
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,560
What's wrong with you today?

817
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,870
You met me by coincidence,

818
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,300
and you passed by my company.

819
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,230
You sent me message after message.

820
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,250
After that, you took me
to the escape room game,

821
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,640
and even bought me a meal.

822
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,850
And now, you're...

823
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,250
Is everything just a coincidence?

824
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,410
Of course.

825
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,040
Do you think I'm a fool?

826
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,850
What exactly are you up to?

827
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,190
Tell me.

828
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,030
Stop

829
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,520
keeping secrets from me.

830
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,530
Just tell me.

831
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,390
Tell me

832
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,610
and I'll cooperate with you.

833
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,030
Okay?

834
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,680
What are you doing?

835
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,290
It started yesterday, right?

836
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,940
It started since yesterday morning.

837
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,540
Am I right?

838
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,080
[What's going on?]

839
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,380
[How did she]

840
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,290
[become so smart all of a sudden?]

841
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,160
Why aren't you

842
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,360
looking into my eyes?

843
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,910
Look into my eyes when you speak.

844
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,580
What's going on?

845
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,380
What exactly are you up to?

846
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,380
Xiao Wudi,

847
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,820
why are you sweating so much?

848
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,510
Do you have a fever?

849
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,620
Why is your heart

850
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,630
beating so fast?

851
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,530
What's wrong? Are you sick?

852
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,330
Nan Xing.

853
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,710
Actually, I...

854
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,350
You what?

855
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,240
Xiao Wudi!

856
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,320
Xiao Wudi!

857
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,790
Xiao Wudi, what's wrong with you?

858
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,590
You...
