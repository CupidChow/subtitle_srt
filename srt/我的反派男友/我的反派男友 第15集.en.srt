[Mr. Bad]

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,780
She just had a first love.

5
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,140
But he didn't like her.

6
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,220
She had a first love?

7
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,259
I thought that she had always been single.

8
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,180
She failed in her first love.

9
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,380
That's why she has been staying single.

10
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,900
Who was her first love?

11
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,259
Who else?

12
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,810
Nan Xing

13
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,220
has always been a high-spirited

14
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,970
and warm-hearted person since young.

15
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,300
This brat of mine

16
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,620
is smart.

17
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,350
But he likes to act cool.

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,580
So, the two of them

19
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,180
fought a lot because of that.

20
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,150
It's okay, Nan Xing.

21
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,890
Later,

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,180
you can pretend
to accidentally bump into him.

23
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,100
Then, you can

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,380
greet him naturally.

25
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,510
What a coincidence.

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,270
What a coincidence.

27
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,750
What a coincidence.

28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,980
Why are you here?

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,579
I'm wearing earphones,

30
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,540
not a blindfold.

31
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,740
Do you think I won't see you

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,579
running after me all the way

33
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,780
from the bus station?

34
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,740
I was not running after you.

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,420
It was just

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,180
training myself.

37
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,620
Let me tell you again.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,700
Don't pretend to know me

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,980
at school after this.

40
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,460
Don't talk to me too.

41
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,710
I'm not pretending to know you.

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,860
I do know you.

43
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,580
If you don't know me,

44
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,530
why do you give me your exercise book?

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,900
I have my own principle.

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,780
I won't copy from a stranger.

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,630
This is your exercise book.

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,870
[Name: Nan Xing]

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Why did you take my exercise book?

50
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,910
You should've told me earlier.

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,860
Three-point! Beautiful!

52
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,720
Xiaojun, go and open the door!

53
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,750
Mao Xiaojun.

54
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,579
The door is not locked.

55
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,780
So, I've let myself in.

56
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,460
Aunt An.

57
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,820
Nan Xing.

58
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,370
I'm here to ask Mao Xiaojun

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,579
some Mathematics questions.

60
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,540
Xiaojun, teach her patiently.

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,460
He'll teach me patiently.

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,990
Teach me.

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,500
Are you asking me to teach you

64
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,430
or are you asking me to do it for you?

65
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,050
I've become dumb because

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,650
you hit my head every day.

67
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,210
You can start

68
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,620
from the first question.

69
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,340
Fine.

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,899
You can just hand in your homework
like this tomorrow.

71
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,980
Please teach me.

72
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,900
I can teach you.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,900
But

74
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
you need to stay for dinner.

75
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,170
Mum, do you have enough food for Nan Xing?

76
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,380
This will take us a while.

77
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
Of course I have enough food for her.

78
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
I've even cooked

79
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,780
an extra dish for you.

80
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,909
Study hard. Dinner will be ready soon.

81
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,500
Aunt.

82
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,900
Actually, I'm almost done.

83
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,940
I can go back now!

84
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,820
Did he dislike her so much?

85
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Yes.

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,330
Did your son

87
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,580
do that on purpose to make her give up

88
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,940
because he knew that Nan Xing liked him?

89
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,580
We don't know.

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,940
They were still young.

91
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,670
We thought that it was cute.

92
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,580
So, we didn't want to interfere.

93
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,780
Nan Xing didn't say anything.

94
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,540
And Xiaojun had never mentioned it.

95
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,300
In the end,

96
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,500
after the accident,

97
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,760
we knew nothing at all.

98
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,500
After that fire,

99
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,540
Nan Xing developed a panic disorder.

100
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,670
And she has never fallen in love again.

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,960
She had only loved once

102
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,180
during her youth.

103
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,260
And it failed.

104
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,380
How can she be inspired

105
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,710
to write about love?

106
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,220
[She doesn't have any experience
in a relationship.]

107
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,500
[She just had a first love.]

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,900
[But he didn't like her.]

109
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,060
This year

110
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,620
is Sujiang High School's

111
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,180
fiftieth anniversary.

112
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,580
At this very moment, I believe

113
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:38,610
[Annual Alumni Banquet]

114
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,540
that you have a lot

115
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,670
to share with us.

116
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,420
Can you give

117
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,700
Sujiang High School

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,980
some words of blessing

119
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,620
on behalf of all the alumni here?

120
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,280
I'll pass the stage to you now.

121
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm grateful to all the teachers

122
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,290
and alumni

123
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,260
for giving me a chance to stand here

124
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,620
and give our blessing

125
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,740
to our alma mater

126
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,540
on behalf of all the alumni here.

127
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,659
For me, Sujiang High School

128
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,020
is a special place.

129
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,940
Because the school doesn't only

130
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,220
focus on the marks that you get

131
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,500
in the college entrance examination.

132
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,770
The school encourages us

133
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,900
to have our own dream

134
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,060
and work for it.

135
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,060
Many years ago,

136
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,820
my partner and I

137
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,020
started from here

138
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,860
because of

139
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,220
a small dream of ours.

140
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,020
We went to the university

141
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,220
and we marched into the world.

142
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,940
So, in the future,

143
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,500
X-Culture

144
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,940
will continue to unlock more achievements

145
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,420
with a thankful heart

146
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
towards our beloved school.

147
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,380
Lastly,

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,770
let us welcome our headmaster

149
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,180
to come up to the stage again.

150
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,780
She has become so beautiful.

151
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,159
And her twin daughters

152
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,420
are so cute.

153
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,930
I want twin daughters too.

154
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,380
They are really cute.

155
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,860
You should head over there first.

156
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,500
I want to visit the equipment room.

157
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,540
Okay. Bye.

158
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Bye.

159
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,780
Bye.

160
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,710
Mao Xiaojun.

161
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,860
Do you have something to tell me?

162
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,500
I like...

163
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,260
Why are you so careless?

164
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,060
[Mao Xiaojun, do you know]

165
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,510
[that I have someone I like again?]

166
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,410
[But I don't dare to tell him that yet.]

167
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,430
[I'm afraid that I'm not good enough.]

168
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,290
[I'm afraid that he'll dislike me.]

169
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,020
Why are you here?

170
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,180
Your mum

171
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,860
asked me to deliver something to you.

172
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,750
[Mao Xiaojun]

173
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,010
How do you know

174
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,080
that I'm here?

175
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,480
I've never thought that you are dumb.

176
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,700
What?

177
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,340
I don't know how to say it.

178
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,030
But I've never thought that you are dumb.

179
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,740
Maybe I did in the past.

180
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,500
But not now.

181
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Besides, so what

182
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,500
if you are a little bit dumb?

183
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,420
It's not like everyone

184
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,460
has to be smart.

185
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,020
I've already delivered the thing to you.

186
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,820
You should

187
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
be careful.

188
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,040
I'll get going now.

189
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,020
[Nan Xing, be brave.]

190
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,460
[Don't miss this chance again.]

191
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,460
Xiao Wudi!

192
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,220
Come to the PEN congress with me.

193
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,850
We are going to publish the next novel.

194
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,980
And Zichen will increase the number

195
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,500
of the scholarship programmes.

196
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
That sounds good.

197
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,980
It seems like your company

198
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,100
will have more things to do this year.

199
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,460
Yes.

200
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,340
Here. Drink some water.

201
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,060
I can do it myself.

202
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,660
Thank you.

203
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,660
Why are you here?

204
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,890
Because I remember.

205
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,380
Zichen.

206
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,220
Ye Qing, continue with your chat.

207
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,290
I'll go and talk to them.

208
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,620
Okay.

209
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,020
Junior, not bad.

210
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,260
-Zichen, see you later.
-Great.

211
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,060
See you later.

212
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,020
Who are they?

213
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,580
They are our seniors.

214
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,580
You've seen them before.

215
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,500
Then,

216
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,180
why did they

217
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,710
compliment me?

218
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,910
You said that you remembered, didn't you?

219
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Ye Qing.

220
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,750
Headmaster.

221
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,560
Zichen is here too.

222
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,670
I thought you were working.

223
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,940
I made some time to come here.

224
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,580
Zichen,

225
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,060
I have to thank you
on behalf of the school.

226
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,540
You've helped us a lot.

227
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,660
Let's just talk

228
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,580
about the renovation of the old library.

229
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,500
If it wasn't for X-Culture,

230
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,760
we wouldn't be able

231
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,600
to raise enough funds to do it.

232
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,460
Yes.

233
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Headmaster Zhao.

234
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,260
Stop complimenting him.

235
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,400
Or else, he's going to get so smug.

236
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,980
Mr. Lu, I was talking about a fact.

237
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,460
Although our school

238
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,420
has brought up a lot of

239
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,460
talents from all walks of life,

240
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,620
we don't have many like Zichen

241
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,820
who not only repay the community,

242
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
but also be the ones

243
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,940
to get the ball rolling.

244
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,780
Our school

245
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,100
doesn't need the money.

246
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,430
We need someone like him

247
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,910
who can get things done.

248
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,580
If Zichen

249
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,180
didn't send Ye Qing to help,

250
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,040
it wouldn't go so smoothly for us.

251
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,820
If you like to help so much,

252
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
come home and help me.

253
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,660
I'm old now.

254
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,220
I want to retire already.

255
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,980
X-Culture

256
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,580
is also one of your investments, right?

257
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,380
In the end,

258
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,700
it still belongs to your family.

259
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,380
Hopefully.

260
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,100
Mr. Lu, let's go and drink some tea.

261
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,180
Sure. After you.

262
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,380
Okay now.

263
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,040
This is not the first time.

264
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,460
If he dislikes

265
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,500
what we do so much,

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,030
why did he

267
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,940
invest in us?

268
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,460
Your dad has always been like that, right?

269
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,560
But no matter what,

270
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,750
he's still your dad.

271
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,860
Thank you

272
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,630
for doing so much for me.

273
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,980
In the past, I thought

274
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,140
that I just needed to donate the money.

275
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,260
I never thought that there would be

276
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,390
so many things to do.

277
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,610
Both of us

278
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,150
have our own strengths.

279
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,860
I just need to do what I'm good at

280
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,900
while you do

281
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,150
what you are good at.

282
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,420
You always say that.

283
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,340
But I know

284
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,340
that you are just sharing

285
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,470
the burdens with me.

286
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,910
Especially when we have to face my dad.

287
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,380
What is it?

288
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,420
Did I say something wrong?

289
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,340
No.

290
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,180
But I hope

291
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,670
you can think

292
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,730
before you make make decisions

293
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,460
about things unrelated to work.

294
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,340
There are things

295
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,140
that I can't take care of for you.

296
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,900
For example...

297
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,450
Senior.

298
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,540
My girlfriend is your fan.

299
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,500
She likes you a lot.

300
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,860
Can she take a photo with you?

301
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,330
Yes.

302
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Can we take a photo

303
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,820
at the conference hall?

304
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,580
Sure.

305
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,660
Thank you, senior.

306
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,540
Thank you, senior.

307
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,980
Go.

308
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,260
I heard that the school

309
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,380
has a school history exhibition, right?

310
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,040
Yes. It's a great exhibition.

311
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,440
Care to show me?

312
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,100
Sure.

313
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,510
They've put a lot of effort into it.

314
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,500
I've already given you

315
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,740
my answer, right?

316
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,640
Why are you here again?

317
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,090
This is the business proposal

318
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,750
that I wrote after I went back.

319
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,180
I think

320
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,500
that if you can understand

321
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,760
this industry better,

322
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,250
you may change your mind.

323
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,740
Even my son can't change my mind.

324
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,810
Why do you think

325
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,540
that I'll invest in you?

326
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,420
Because of this proposal?

327
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,820
Zichen's original novel

328
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,490
has brought him

329
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,020
a large number of first-generation fans.

330
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,010
In the future,

331
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,140
we can turn the IP

332
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
into money.

333
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,860
Besides, I believe
that three years from now,

334
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
the cultural IP industry

335
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,900
will bloom.

336
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,700
Uncle.

337
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm sure you know that.

338
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,040
Do you think that I'll say yes?

339
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,820
That's because

340
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,740
you don't believe in your son.

341
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,260
Last time,

342
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,560
you said that he was too naive.

343
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,540
I agreed.

344
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,220
But I think

345
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,700
that this naivety

346
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,360
is the most precious thing

347
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,420
to a creator.

348
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
I will work by his side

all the risks.

352

I hope that you can consider
investing in us.

353
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,340
Why do you

354
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,540
want me to invest in you?

355
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,500
Haven't you discussed this

356
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,760
with other investors?

357
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,740
Because I hope

358
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,640
that both of you
can give each other a chance.

359
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,940
Is it important for my son

360
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,840
to give me a chance?

361
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,660
You always hope

362
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,990
that he can take over your company, right?

363
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,340
But if you

364
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,940
force him to do that,

365
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,380
with his temper,

366
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,460
do you think

367
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,720
he will willingly manage

368
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
the company well?

369
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,090
What can you get out of this?

370
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,130
That dream of his

371

is my dream too.

Okay then.

373
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,380
I'll invest in this project.

374
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,700
But don't be too happy first.

375

You can't be together with Lu Zichen.

one day

that you are in a relationship with him,

380
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,060

Go ahead and tell me.

Yes. For the PEN congress. //

The PEN congress is next week, right?

396

Yes.

Am I too excited about it?

398

You are right.

399
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,620
You need to wear a nice outfit
for the PEN congress.

Let me see.

401
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,860
You can't wear this.

402
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,620
The jeans are too casual.

403
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,340
You are an author now.

404
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,160
You need to wear something
with better quality.

405
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,500
You can't wear this.

406
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,820
This is a man's shirt.

407
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,930
It's too neutral.

408
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,860
No.

What about this?

410
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,540
This can work.
You have to pair it with a skirt.

411
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,300
Let me see.

412
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,060
Look at your hair.

413
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,600
What's wrong with my hair?

414
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,220
Our hair is like our face.

415
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,620
It's very important.

416

417
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,940
My hair has always been like this.

418
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,270
There will be a lot of men

419
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,740
at the PEN congress.

420
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,590
Xiong will be there too, right?

421
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,100
Let's see. Let's style it differently.

422
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,500
Let's do something different.

423

What about this?

424
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,180
Will I look nice with that hair?

425
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,900

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,810
What do you need me to do?

520
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,070
It was just a greeting.

521
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,330
You don't have to be so nervous.

522
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:38,740
You

523
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,580
are our

524
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,460
most important author today.

525
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,740
Relax.

526
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,860
Hi, handsome hunk.

527
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,210
You are here too.

528
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,260
Do you remember me?

529
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,500
Of course.

530
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
You are Miss Jiao.

531
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,060
[You interrupted]

532
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,020
[my lunch with Nan Xing last time.]

533
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,460
[I haven't even held you
accountable for that yet.]

534
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,340
Not only you are handsome,

535
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,900
you have a good memory too.

536
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,360
I don't have a good memory.

537
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,560
But I can hold my grudges pretty well.

538
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,740
He's not so good with words.

539
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,380
Let's keep our luggage.

540
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,180
See you later, handsome hunk.

541
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,640
Miss Ye.

542
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,020
How is it? Is everyone here?

543
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,660
Yes.

544
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,110
Okay.

545
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,660
Miss Ye.

546
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,140
Let's go.

547
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,940
Are you ready?

548
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,780
Let's go then.

549
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,660
Let me keep your luggage for you.

550
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:19,990
Okay.

551
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,180
Hello. You are here too.

552
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,460
Miss Ye.

553
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,250
Miss Ye, why isn't the boss here?

554
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,180
He doesn't attend

555
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,240
this kind of event.

556
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,660
He's here.

557
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,940
-Boss.
-Boss?

558
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,420
Boss, why are you here?

559
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,100
Let's go together.

560
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,070
Let's go.

561
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,260
This way, please.

562
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,150
Let's go.

563
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,820
Why didn't you tell us

564
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,740
about it earlier?

565
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,000
They need to be mentally prepared for it.

566
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
Why do they

567
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,330
need to be mentally prepared for it?

568
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,220
You don't like

569
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,070
to be around strangers, right?

570
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,700
Discovering new talents

571
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,340
is the most important thing

572
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,460
to us.

573
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,300
Okay then.

574
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,420
You should talk more to everyone

575
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,880
for the next two days then.

576
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,420
Next, it's Chu.

577
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,340
You'll room up with Mr. Shi.

578
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,780
Okay.

579
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,490
Yufan.

580
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,820
You'll room up with Qianqian.

581
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,140
Okay.

582
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,200
Take the key first.

583
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,860
Nan Xing.

584
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,600
You'll room up with me.

585
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,460
Okay.

586
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,300
Well, boss.

587
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,660
I'm sorry.

588
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,860
This homestay has limited room.

589
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,300
So, you may have to room up with...
Xiao Wudi!

590
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,620
You may have to room up

591
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,580
with Xiao Wudi.

592
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,420
I can look for another hotel

593
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,260
to stay in.

594
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,380
Yes. He can do that.

595
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,150
Okay.

596
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,060
I'll help you search

597
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,120
for a hotel nearby.

598
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,770
You don't have to do that.

599
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,860
Remember who you are.

600
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,180
You are an author.

601
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,380
Not an assistant.

602
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,490
Don't think of Mr. Lu

603
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,840
as someone so shallow.

604
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,470
He's not a three-year-old.

605
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,490
There are many things

606
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,020
that he can do by himself.

607
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,380
Right?

608
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
I can do it myself.

609
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,140
It's okay. It's no trouble.

610
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,050
I can help you look for it.

611
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,580
Just room up with Xiao Wudi.

612
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,100
You are going to work together after this.

613
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,260
You should get to know each other better.

614
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,020
I don't mind.

615
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,340
So, all of you

616
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,060
have your own room now.

617
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,550
Let's go back to our room

618
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,580
to unpack.

619
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,340
Later,

620
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,260
let's meet up at the entrance
of the old town

621
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,020
so that we can have lunch together.

622
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,100
We'll tour around
the old town this afternoon.

623
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,660
A round of applause.

624
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,940
Great!

625
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,830
Okay now.

626
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
You can go to your room now

627
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,300
to unpack.

628
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,900
Let's go.

629
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,700
See you later.

630
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,760
It's your fault for coming

631
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,700
without telling us beforehand.

632
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,500
Enjoy the result of your action.

633
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,460
Come. Let's find our room.

634
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,620
What are we going?

635
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,910
We are waiting for the boss.

636
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,860
Boss.

637
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,580
-Boss.
-Boss.

638
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,450
Everyone,

639
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,160
our boss is here.

640
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,010
We can depart now

641
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,100
to tour around the place.

642
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,590
Okay. Let's go.

643
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,690
Let's go.

644
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,700
Are you sure you want to join us

645
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,260
instead of resting in your room?

646
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,860
I...

647
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,340
I want to...

648
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,740
I want to join.

649
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,540
Actually, I

650
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,620
know a century-old shop

651
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,700
that sells mung bean jelly.

652
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,830
Do you want to try it?

653
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,100
Sure.

654
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,430
We can have an appetiser before lunch.

655
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
What do you think?

656
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,610
It's delicious.

657
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,020
I told you, right?

658
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,780
How do you know about this place?

659
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,460
Well...

660
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,020
I researched online

661
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,060
about this place.

662
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,060
I want another serving.

663
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,500
You want another serving?

664
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,660
What about lunch?

665
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,490
Fine.

666
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,380
Boss.

667
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,780
Another serving, please.

668
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,420
Okay.

669
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,180
Add this one.

670
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,540
Okay.

671
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,380
Here.

672
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,180
Thank you.

673
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,660
Today, you...

674
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,220
-Hello.
-Nan Xing.

675
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,580
Handsome hunk.

676
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,980
What are you eating here?

677
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,860
Mung bean jelly? I want to eat it too.

678
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,790
How about I treat all of you to this?

679
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,780
You are the best!

680
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,750
I want more osmanthus.

681
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,230
Okay.

682
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,930
Boss. Five servings, please.

683
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:47,660
Okay.

684
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,500
I want the osmanthus one.

685
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,020
Nan Xing.

686
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,860
Mr. Shi,

687
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,580
what flavour do you want?

688
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,440
I want a double.

689
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,460
Let's eat ice cream.

690
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,180
Sure.

691
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,540
Boss.

692
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,700
Hello.

693
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,310
This one.

694
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,580
I want this egg waffle

695
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,440
with the chocolate ice cream.

696
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,510
Where's the ice cream?

697
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,700
Boss.

698
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,500
It's cold.

699
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,780
This is interesting.

700
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,740
Here.

701
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,780
Let me buy one for you.

702
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,460
There's still a lot of fun ahead.

703
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,050
Peanut candy.

704
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,140
What is this?

705
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,660
Look.

706
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,540
We can make pottery here.

707
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,710
Do you want to try it?

708
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,870
So, she is...

709
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,300
Do you want to play it?

710
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm good at this.

711
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,260
Come. Let me teach you.

712
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,060
Come. Come in.

713
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,490
What do you want to make?

714
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,500
I'm going to make

715
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,020
the Eiffel Tower.

716
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,700
This is your first time.

717
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,760
And you are going
to challenge something so difficult?

718
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
You can't do that.

719
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,780
It'll break if you do that.

720
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,260
Let me teach you. See?

721
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,100
See?

722
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,320
Add some water. It's a little bit dry.

723
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,820
You have to start from the bottom
and go towards the middle.

724
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,680
Is this enough?

725
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,870
Okay. It's about right now.

726
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,680
You can stop adding water.

727
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,650
Did you

728
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,620
step on the switch?

729
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,380
Slow it down.

730
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,780
This is...

731
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,420
What are you going to do?

732
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,660
I want to make

733
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,900
a gift

734
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,780
that can remind us

735
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,660
of us today.

736
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,660
What does it mean?

737
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,460
You'll know after I make it.

738
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,820
Since it's about us,

739
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,460
let's do it together.

740
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,220
Sure.

741
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,580
Just don't ruin it.

742
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,700
What do you need me to do?

743
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,780
You can roughly shape it first.

744
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,360
I'll add the water for you.

745
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:56,820
Okay.

746
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,080
Make sure that it's not too thin
at the sides.

747
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,460
You can't do this.

748
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,660
Or else, it'll crack.

749
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,060

Let's continue.

792
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
We are discussing

793
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,180
about the theme

794
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,180
of our next creation.

795
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,060
We have suspense and romance so far.

796
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,970
What do you think?

797
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,540
We have time travel
from ancient times too.

798
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,940
You don't have to do this.

799
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,500
You are right.

800
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,900
Are you talking to me?

801
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,520
What's popular now

802
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,100
is for the male lead to...

803
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,780
I'm starting to pity you.

804
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,620
Getting into a relationship

805
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,260
is indeed difficult for you.

806
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,620
But after reading your novel,

807
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,350
something has dawned on me.

808
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,700
What is it?

809
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,660
The male lead

810
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,980
can't even

811
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
bring happiness to the female lead.

812
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,010
But he's still brave enough
to chase after love.

813
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,420
So,

814
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,280
I have nothing to be afraid of.

815
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,260
Wait.

816
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,740
What do you mean

817
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,230
by he can't even bring happiness

818
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,290
to the female lead?

819
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:19,940
I...

820
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,900
What's wrong with the male lead?

821
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,300
He's striking,

822
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,100
he's talented,

823
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,960
and he's good at martial arts.

824
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,900
Why can't he bring happiness

825
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,960
to the female lead?

826
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,270
Based on the logic of the novel,

827
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,330
after the male lead

828
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,420
gets into a relationship
with the female lead,

829
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
it means

830
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,740
that her dream of falling in love

831
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,870
has been fulfilled.

832
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,490
Then,

833
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,700
the wish that she made towards the fairy

834
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,560
will come true.

835
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,900
After completing the mission,

836
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,180
the male lead will return
to his original world.

837
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,420
Then, the female lead

838
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,300
will be left alone in the real world.

839
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,760
It means
that they'll be separated forever.

840
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,740
But I think it'll be

841
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,180
a nice tragic ending.

842
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,380
Tragic?

843
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,120
Don't you think so?

844
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,780
Besides, don't you think
that the male lead

845
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,640
is too reckless with his actions?

846
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,220
He came out of nowhere.

847
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,020
And he can disappear at any time.

848
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,370
But he still dares
to court after the female lead.

849
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,300
Don't you think that he's selfish?

850
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,340
But he has always

851
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,500
been selfish.

852
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,480
So, it's in line

853
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,700
with his character.

854
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,420
Don't think too much.

855
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,780
Personally, I prefer

856
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,900
a tragic love story.

857
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,430
You don't have to change it.

858
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,130
As I said,

859
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,140
you've inspired me.

860
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,620
I want to thank you.

861
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,010
Look. Even a male lead like him

862
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,320
can confess his love.

863
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,620
What should I be afraid of,

864
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,220
right?

865
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,230
Nan Xing, I'll go and buy some food.

866
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,380
Why are you sitting here

867
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,380
by yourself?

868
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,140
Is this for me?

869
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,600
Give it a taste.

870
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,100
Aren't you going to sit with them?

871
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,630
Let's go.

872
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,020
Okay.

873
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,740
Everyone.

874
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,580
After this trip to the old town,

875
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,660
we've gotten closer to each other.

876
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,860
Don't be shy around each other after this.

877
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,700
Let's communicate more

878
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,820
in our future creations, okay?

879
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,620
As the editor-in-chief,
I'll drink the first glass.

880
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:18,980
Here.

881
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,380
-Okay.
-Thank you, Editor-in-Chief.

882
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,040
Thank you, Editor-in-Chief.

883
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,990
You are amazing.

884
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,700
By the way,

885
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,380
after dinner,

886
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,610
let's take a walk
and enjoy the fireworks, okay?

887
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,380
-Yes!
-Great!

888
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,520
Handsome hunk.

889
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,540
Why do you look so down?

890
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,300
I'm not.

891
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,020
I'm just a bit tired.

892
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,780
I'll pass for the fireworks.

893
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,460
I can't watch the fireworks.

894
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,820
So, I'll pass too.

895
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,020
Since both of you are not going,

896
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,500
do you

897
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,900
want to tour around the place again later?

898
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Miss Jiao, let's eat.

899
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,140
Later,

900
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,360
let's watch the fireworks together.

901
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,940
Sure.

902
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,620
I'm really looking forward

903
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,740
to tonight's

904
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,580
fireworks.

905
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,420
Me too.

906
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,140
We have to take photos
for each other later.

907
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,470
Sure.

908
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
You need to take

909
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,620
those kinds of trendy photos

910
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,480
that we always see in our Moments.

911
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,780
Nan Xing, handsome hunk.

912
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,180
You can do your own activities then.

913
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,140
We'll go and watch the fireworks now.

914
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,820
-Bye.
-Bye.

915
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,550
Let's go.

916
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,010
-Bye.
-Bye.

917
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,060
Where are you going later?

918
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm a little bit tired.

919
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,780
I want to take a rest.

920
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,000
Then, I'll go back and take a rest too.

921
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:48,780
Okay.
