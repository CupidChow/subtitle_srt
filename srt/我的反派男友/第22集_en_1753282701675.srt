1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,760
You are destined to be with me

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,640
in this vast space.

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Come to me.

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,040
Stay with me.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
You are the past and the present.

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Our lives will never change.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,480
Come for me.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
Stay by me.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,440
Your look fills my heart.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,520
I'll be with me.

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,120
Episode 18

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,680
You are still worrying about Miss An?

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,480
What era is this?

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,040
She just said it casually.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
I won't really disappear.

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,920
That's right.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,280
Then why are you worrying?

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,520
Why?

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,600
It's just...

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,360
That's why.

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Go.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,120
I was just think,

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
how much do you like Mao Xiaojun,

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,080
during all these years,

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,480
he was still giving his all in this disease?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Are you jealous?

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm here.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm serious.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
Didn't I tell you

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm close to his sister?

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,240
Actually, when I was close to him,

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I only knew him when he was a kid.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,040
Then we grew up.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
He suddenly stopped telling me about his feelings.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,760
And he always didn't notice me.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
I'm knocking.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm knocking.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm knocking. You didn't hear me.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Get out.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Get out.

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,920
What are you doing?

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Writing a diary?

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,800
Get out.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm just curious about what you do in your room every day.

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,560
Okay, I got it. I'll go out.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,760
Wang Xiaojun, wait for me.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
It's the same when he was in school.

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
He didn't let me talk to him.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,440
What a coincidence.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,480
Why are you here?

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
I'll say it again.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,160
Don't pretend to know me in school.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,720
Don't talk to me.

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,920
I didn't pretend to know you.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,120
I knew you.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
Then he aroused my curiosity.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,920
I thought maybe he would talk to me

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
after I confessed.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
Wang Xiaojun.

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,840
Wang Xiaojun.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
You have something to say to me.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,120
I...

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,320
I told you to go home after school.

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,960
Don't follow me and don't look for me.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,840
But I still didn't tell him.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,960
Miss An knew my little mind.

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
She knew I was stupid.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,160
So she always deliberately

69
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,040
gave me some chances.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,800
Nanxing, hurry up.

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm going to be late.

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,520
Don't forget to get your homework.

73
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,160
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm late.

75
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm going to get my homework.

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,560
Are you going out?

78
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,680
Nanxing.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Work overtime?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,960
It's night shift today.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,920
You put Nanxing in our house at night shift?

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
She can't sleep well in the lab.

83
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,080
I can't trouble you every day.

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
It's okay.

85
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,520
I was thinking of buying more food.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,520
I'll ask you to eat together after I finish cooking.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,920
Thank you.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,240
We've already eaten.

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,880
Then I'll ask Xiaojun to send you a supper

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,880
after I'm done cooking later.

91
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,520
Okay.

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,280
I can eat more after I'm done.

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,880
Xiaojun is so good at studying.

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
Don't always affect him.

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't say that.

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
If you don't want to eat,

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,360
Nanxing wants to eat, right?

98
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
It was that day

99
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,320
that the lab caught fire.

100
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,200
I'll put it in here.

101
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,520
Nanxing, are you okay?

102
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,360
It's still in there.

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
Wang Xiaojun.

105
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,760
Don't worry. Wait for me.

106
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,660
Gong Hon.

107
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm sure you'll be all right.

108
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,920
Here.

109
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,480
What happened?

110
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,640
Were you done Cuzheng?

111
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,120
Someone'sm here.

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Tropical heavy rain.

113
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,960
Hold on, Ge変得看君的彼龜

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Let me go.

115
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Dad!

116
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Dad! Dad!

117
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Wang Youjin!

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Dad!

119
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Wang Youjin!

120
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm so good, so smart, so excellent.

121
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I can do anything I want.

122
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Unlike me, I have no other advantages other than physical fitness.

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
I have no other advantages.

124
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Sometimes I even think that if the person who survived is him,

125
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
he might be better than our boss.

126
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,960
And Ms. An won't be so sad.

127
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
He is such a good person.

128
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
He is such a good person.

129
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
He died for me.

130
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
He died for me.

131
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,960
He died for someone he hates so much.

132
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
He doesn't hate you.

133
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Actually, he has always liked you.

134
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
How is that possible?

135
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
If he were alive, he would be angry at me.

136
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
He hates me the most.

137
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm telling you the truth.

138
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
After I came back from the Red Palace,

139
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
I dreamed of him.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
You might think he hates you,

141
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
but he likes you in a way.

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
How is that possible?

143
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
You don't even know him.

144
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
How could you dream of him?

145
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't worry about me.

146
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
After I finish handling the company,

147
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I will have a two-day break with the boss.

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I will take a break.

149
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I will take a break for two days.

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
I will take a break for two days.

151
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
How about I play with you for two days?

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Okay, let's go home.

153
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Let's go.

154
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
He is such a good person.

155
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
He died for me.

156
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
He died for someone he hates so much.

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Sometimes I even think

158
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
it would be great if he were alive.

159
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
The doctor said

160
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
the spirit of separation needs to be controlled.

161
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
But the one who can break my knot

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
is not me.

163
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
They are gone.

164
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
As a replacement for you

165
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
to save Nanxing,

166
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
help me complete a task.

167
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
So this is the task.

168
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
I have a question.

169
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
What is it?

170
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
If the hero in the novel

171
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
finds out that the woman he loves is in pain,

172
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
he can help the other person to break the knot.

173
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
But the consequence is

174
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
he will disappear from this world.

175
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
If it were you, what would you do?

176
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Of course I would cure him.

177
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
But you will die.

178
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
I would do the same.

179
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Su Yu, you love this world.

180
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
You should hug it

181
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
and walk around it.

182
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
This is our last case.

183
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
You have done so much for me.

184
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
It's time to rest.

185
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I like you.

186
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
But I want to give you

187
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
real freedom.

188
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
I want to be with you.

189
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I want to be with you.

190
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I want to be with you.

191
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I want to be with you.

192
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
And you should spend your time

193
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
on doing what you really like.

194
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
That's good.

195
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
You have time to do what you like.

196
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
You don't have to worry about the company.

197
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Go.

198
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Go do what you really like.

199
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Go do what you really like.

200
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
How long are you going to stay?

201
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Boss, you are going to kick me out?

202
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm talking about your job.

203
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Or you like to make wontons

204
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
and you are going to take my class?

205
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
I...

206
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
I don't know what's the use of reading so many books.

207
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
One is not afraid of danger.

208
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
One is afraid of danger.

209
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
My heart is broken.

210
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
So cruel.

211
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Why do two people like each other

212
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
and push each other apart?

213
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Ma Lang doesn't know how to understand Su Yu.

214
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
If it were me,

215
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I would have hesitated.

216
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

217
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Do you know how many things

218
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
they have experienced together?

219
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
They are already

220
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
the most important people

221
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
in each other's lives.

222
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
I don't know what to do.

223
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
They are already

224
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
the most important people

225
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
in each other's lives.

226
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
And Ma Lang

227
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
has to grow up for Su Yu.

228
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Two independent and

229
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
one-sided souls

230
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
have to walk together.

231
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
What do you have to pay for?

232
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
As long as you love each other,

233
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
it's a little dangerous.

234
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
What does it count?

235
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Morning.

236
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Did you sleep well?

237
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Wait for me after work today.

238
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I'll pick you up.

239
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Morning.

240
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm awake.

241
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Did you sleep well?

242
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Come in.

243
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm here.

244
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm here.

245
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm here.

246
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm here.

247
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Come in.

248
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Boss.

249
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
This is the contract you asked me to read.

250
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
I have marked all the

251
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
questions about the golden fish

252
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
with a label.

253
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
You learn these things

254
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
faster than me.

255
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I picked up a good textbook.

256
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
By the way, boss.

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Can I apply for a

258
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
correction these two days?

259
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I have a look.

260
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
We don't have

261
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
any important arrangements this week.

262
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
The sales follow-up of the killing

263
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
all the contact information

264
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
and the time table

265
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
I have arranged all.

266
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
I think you should resign.

267
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Boss.

268
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
I just want to apply for a correction.

269
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Our company's rules are fine.

270
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
You are a good assistant.

271
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
I have been watching your works

272
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
and readers' feedback these two days.

273
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
I think your writing talent

274
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
can't be wasted on this position.

275
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
So I asked them to do this yesterday.

276
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Sign it.

277
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
You are the full-time writer

278
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
of our company.

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
This also means

280
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
you have to resign

281
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
from the job of an assistant.

282
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Can I really do this?

283
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
This is your own business.

284
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Think about it.

285
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
You can do it.

286
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Boss.

287
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
I have made up my mind.

288
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I will sign it.

289
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
So fast?

290
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I think some things

291
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
don't need to be thought too much.

292
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
You should believe in your intuition.

293
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I think you should think it over.

294
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I have thought it over.

295
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
You should go out and think about it.

296
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Calm down.

297
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
I am calm.

298
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Go out.

299
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I am not calm.

300
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Why do you say I am not calm?

301
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
I am not calm.

302
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
You are so calm.

303
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Right?

304
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
The sleeves on the right

305
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
should be on the sleeves on the left.

306
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Okay.

307
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Shake it down.

308
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Shake it down.

309
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Xiao Xiong.

310
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Wait a minute.

311
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
You practice it yourself.

312
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I will be back soon.

313
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Xiao Xiong.

314
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Why are you here?

315
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Auntie.

316
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I need to talk to you.

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Just put it behind.

318
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Here.

319
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Give it to me.

320
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Sit down.

321
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Auntie.

322
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
How about

323
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
we talk somewhere else?

324
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Just sit here and talk.

325
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I have to rehearse later.

326
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Okay.

327
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Well.

328
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Xiao Xiong.

329
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Actually, I know

330
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
why you came to me.

331
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I don't object

332
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
you and Nanxing to date.

333
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
You see, I have never asked

334
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
about your family, right?

335
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
I asked that day

336
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,960
what you two were going to do in the future.

337
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
You said you hadn't decided yet.

338
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
So I just

339
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
worried

340
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
what happened between you two.

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
What can't be solved?

342
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Auntie.

343
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Actually, I am not

344
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
a human in this world.

345
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
I am Xiao Wu Di

346
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
in the novel Nanxing.

347
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
So I can't stay in this world.

348
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
So cool.

349
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Dad, when did you come back?

350
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I came back after work.

351
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
You wrote Xiao Wu Di

352
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
is more attractive

353
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
than your hero, Lu Zichen.

354
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
I see.

355
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
You two must have

356
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
taken me as a three-year-old child,

357
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
right?

358
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
How can I believe

359
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
that you lied to me

360
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
with this kind of story?

361
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I am sorry.

362
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Auntie.

363
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
So how did you come

364
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
to this world?

365
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
I just figured out yesterday

366
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
what my mission

367
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
was in this world.

368
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Mission?

369
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Actually, I came to cure Nanxing.

370
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
This is my mission.

371
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
You mean her panic disorder?

372
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Yes.

373
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
The doctor said that

374
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
her treatment was not very successful.

375
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
But

376
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
the cure still needs to be done by the person in the coffin.

377
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Whether it's her father

378
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
or my son,

379
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
they are all gone.

380
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
You may have misunderstood

381
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
this matter.

382
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
In fact, the person in the coffin

383
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
has always been Nanxing herself.

384
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
She has hit this knot

385
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
in her heart.

386
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
If she doesn't say something,

387
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
she will never be able to solve it.

388
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
What do you want to do?

389
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
I need you to do me a favor.

390
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
What?

391
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Yes.

392
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Come in.

393
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Besides those conditions,

394
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
you need to adjust it.

395
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
The rest is OK.

396
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Thank you.

397
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
If you have any questions,

398
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
we can talk at any time.

399
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Boss, are you looking for me?

400
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I have already signed

401
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
the divorce report.

402
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
You can focus on creating in the future.

403
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
OK. Thank you, boss.

404
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Being a writer

405
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
is not easy at all.

406
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I have high requirements for my work.

407
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
But...

408
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
I know.

409
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
I will leave after

410
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
the new assistant is appointed.

411
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Then go to the HR department

412
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
to check

413
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
if there are any

414
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
suitable new candidates.

415
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
When the new assistant is interviewed,

416
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
you can come and have a look.

417
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
No need.

418
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
I trust you.

419
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I will send you

420
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
the rest of the information

421
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
when I sort it out tomorrow.

422
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
OK.

423
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
We are leaving.

424
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Bye.

425
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Why are you here?

426
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
I am here to celebrate Nan Xiaoxin

427
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
becoming a full-time writer.

428
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Didn't I tell you

429
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
I would have dinner with Mr. Ye today?

430
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I told you not to come and find me.

431
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
I know.

432
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
So I am here to help you.

433
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
I want to be the first person

434
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
to share my happiness with you.

435
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I thought you would think

436
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I was too impulsive.

437
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
How could it be?

438
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
You are talented.

439
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Of course you should use it well.

440
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
And now I think

441
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
you don't need to

442
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
be Lu Zichen's assistant anymore.

443
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I agree with you with both hands and feet.

444
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
But in this way,

445
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
I have a lot of things to deal with.

446
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I have a lot of work to do.

447
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
I can't be with you.

448
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
What's the big deal?

449
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I can be with you

450
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
as much as I want.

451
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
If you want to have dinner with Mr. Ye,

452
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
I will send you there.

453
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I will pick you up

454
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
after you finish your dinner.

455
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Why are you so nice?

456
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Of course.

457
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
It's my first day.

458
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Let's go.

459
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I can't have dinner with you today.

460
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I will treat you to a big meal tomorrow.

461
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Is that okay?

462
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Okay.

463
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Let me think

464
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
what Xiao Wu Di likes to eat.

465
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
He said

466
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
breakfast is not enough.

467
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Ten dishes are not enough.

468
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
It's not a normal life.

469
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Let's go for breakfast.

470
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
We can order egg tart.

471
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I don't have much time left.

472
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Goodbye.

473
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Fried beef and lotus.

474
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
I will do whatever you want.

475
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
I will do it.

476
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Here you are.

477
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
I made it.

478
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
That's too much.

479
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Nanxing,

480
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
there are no guests in the restaurant now.

481
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Let Qin Qian eat with you.

482
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Okay.

483
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Here.

484
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
They are all from the restaurant.

485
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Try them and give your opinions.

486
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Okay.

487
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Thank you, aunt.

488
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
There is another dish.

489
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
You two can eat first.

490
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Okay.

491
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Don't bother.

492
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Hurry up.

493
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Eat.

494
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Try these.

495
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
My mom's craft.

496
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Congratulations on becoming

497
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
a author of the contract.

498
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Nanxing.

499
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
What Nanxing?

500
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Actually, when I went to the company

501
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
for an interview,

502
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I was just thinking

503
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
it would be nice if I could stay.

504
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
So I can work with idols.

505
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
I didn't expect you

506
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
to give me this opportunity.

507
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
What's more,

508
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
you encouraged me to write.

509
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
You made me believe

510
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I could become a writer.

511
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
I have to thank you for all this.

512
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
You have to thank me

513
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
and thank yourself for your efforts.

514
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
I used to be

515
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
a person with no dreams.

516
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
But now I found it.

517
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
My dream is to become

518
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
a good writer.

519
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
It's a happy thing

520
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
to have a dream to work hard.

521
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
You should cherish it.

522
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Keep going.

523
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
What about you?

524
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
What's your dream?

525
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
To open a company,

526
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
make it a listed company,

527
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
and make a lot of money.

528
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
What else?

529
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Your dream must be great.

530
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
My dream is

531
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
to realize a dream

532
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
with a boy.

533
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
So,

534
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
don't you want to

535
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
realize it with him now?

536
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Actually,

537
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
I used to be afraid

538
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
of losing someone.

539
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
But now I think

540
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
as long as we can be happy together,

541
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
face difficulties together,

542
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
and look forward to the future,

543
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
even if the ending

544
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
may not be so good,

545
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
at least

546
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I won't be so regretful.

547
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
I don't think

548
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I'm afraid of losing someone now.

549
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Here it comes.

550
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
So much more?

551
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
What else do you want to eat?

552
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Tell me.

553
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
No, aunt.

554
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
It's enough.

555
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Mom, you've worked hard.

556
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Then you two eat.

557
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
I won't bother you.

558
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Okay.

559
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Thank you, aunt.

560
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
You're welcome.

561
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Try it.

562
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Which one?

563
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Fried fish.

564
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
I've eaten it since I was a kid.

565
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Sorry.

566
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
It's delicious.

567
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
It's delicious.

568
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
It's delicious.

569
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
It's delicious.

570
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
It's delicious.

571
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
It's delicious.

572
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
It's delicious.

573
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Try this one.

574
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Boss,

575
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,960
the platform will come to talk about copyright issues on Thursday.

576
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
I need to talk to you about the content.

577
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Remind me then.

578
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
This is something

579
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
that needs to be reminded.

580
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Do you want to talk about our work?

581
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
I think you two are quite close.

582
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
What's wrong, boss?

583
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
I don't think

584
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
love is related to me.

585
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
But I'm still quite rich.

586
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
But I'm still quite rich.

587
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
So I don't think

588
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I have that much money these days.

589
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
But I'm still talented.

590
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,960
You've made great progress.

591
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
You even joke around.

592
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Joke around?

593
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Do you think I'm joking?

594
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Do you think I'm not talented?

595
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
That was a joke just now.

596
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
It's funny.

597
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Okay.

598
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
I'm looking for a house recently.

599
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I'll move out when I find a suitable one.

600
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
It's okay, boss.

601
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Really?

602
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
When?

603
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Xiao Di.

604
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm just concerned about him.

605
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm afraid to disturb your creation.

606
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Don't think it's easy

607
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
to sign a contract with our company.

608
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Okay, boss.

609
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
I got it.

610
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I'll go to rest first.

611
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Okay.

612
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Boss.

613
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm having dinner

614
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
with Mr. Ye tonight.

615
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
I think he cares about you.

616
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Do you want to

617
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
talk to him?

618
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
It's not the time yet.

619
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
When I'm not so childish,

620
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
I have the right to get close to him.

621
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,960
But what if he doesn't wait for you?

622
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
As long as he really wants it,

623
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
he can have other choices.

624
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Anyway, you can't have other choices.

625
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm the only one you can choose.

626
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I got it.

627
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
I'll brush my teeth.

628
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
You can continue.

629
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
You can continue.

630
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
You had a good talk

631
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
with Nanxin today.

632
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Yes.

633
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
She's a formal

634
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
contract holder now.

635
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm very happy for her.

636
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Yes.

637
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
It's good to do

638
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
what you like.

639
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
You should do the same.

640
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
I'll go to rest first.

641
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Okay.

642
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
What about you?

643
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
What's your dream?

644
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
My dream

645
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
is to realize a dream

646
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
with a boy.

647
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
I used to

648
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
think

649
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
as long as we can be happy together,

650
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
face the difficulties together,

651
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
and look forward to the future,

652
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
even if the ending

653
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
may not be so good,

654
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
at least we won't be so regretful.

655
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Boss,

656
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
are you done?

657
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
The car has stopped

658
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
at the gate of the community.

659
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Boss.

660
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
You're in such a hurry to go to work?

661
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
What else?

662
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Breakfast.

663
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I made it for you alone.

664
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Don't eat it for others.

665
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I'm sorry.

666
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
I'm sorry.

667
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
I'm sorry.

668
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
I'm sorry.

669
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm sorry.

670
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm sorry.

671
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm sorry.

672
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Before you go to work,

673
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
did you forget

674
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
something else?

675
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
What?

676
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
My lips are a little dry.

677
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Why are you so sticky recently?

678
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Really?

679
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Maybe

680
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm afraid that if I don't stick it now,

681
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
I won't have a chance to stick it in the future.

682
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Don't talk nonsense.

683
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
The car has arrived.

684
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Yes.

685
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
I'm leaving first.

686
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Go ahead.

687
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Come back early.

688
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
Yes.

689
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Little brother.

690
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Dad.

691
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
Why don't you answer it?

692
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I'll give you a heart.

693
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Oh, right.

694
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I'll keep it.

695
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
I'll give you a heart too.

696
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm leaving.

697
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Bye bye.

698
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Bye bye.

699
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
For love,

700
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I should be open.

701
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Maybe I'm a little bit sad.

702
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Just be with the time

703
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,960
to deal with my own sadness.

704
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Why don't you call her in?

705
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Do you think she is suitable?

706
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Yes.

707
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I think she is very suitable.

708
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
I don't know what to ask

709
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
when I see her resume.

710
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
She has already

711
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
handed over the resume.

712
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Let's meet first.

713
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,960
May I start the interview?

714
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Mr. Ye.

715
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Or you can just be like this.

716
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Miss.

717
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
I'll do it.

718
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Ye...

719
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Miss Ye.

720
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
The position you want to apply for

721
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
is the assistant of the president.

722
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
What is the reason

723
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
for you to apply for this position?

724
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
This is the highest

725
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
elimination rate in the department.

726
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
The assistant of the president

727
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
is the highest elimination rate

728
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
in this company.

729
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Even if it fails,

730
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
it's not a big deal.

731
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Because

732
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
I want to do

733
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
what I really like.

734
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,960
What do you really like?

735
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
Every book of Mr. Lu

736
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
is like a real book.

737
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Working with him,

738
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
growing up together,

739
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
is my biggest dream.

740
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
I've never changed it.

741
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
This belief will support me

742
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
to face bigger challenges

743
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
after I get into the job.

744
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Don't give up.

745
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
The athlete's teeth teach me

746
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
not to win, never give up.

747
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Don't give up.

748
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Don't give up.

749
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Okay.

750
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Welcome to join X Culture.

751
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Thank you, interviewers.

752
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I'll do my best.

753
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Miss Ye,

754
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
it's great that you can come back.

755
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Miss Ye.

756
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Sister Nan Qing,

757
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
your wings are hard.

758
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I've resigned.

759
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
No one can control me.

760
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
What about the boss?

761
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Don't tell him.

762
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I'll take him there.

763
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay.

764
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Come in.

765
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Boss,

766
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
