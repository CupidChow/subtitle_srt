5
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,280
So nice.

6
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:40,940
Enough, mum.

7
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,780
You've looked at them so many times.

8
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,120
They are the same.

9
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,970
I haven't looked my fill yet.

10
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,160
By the way,

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,000
this is for you.

12
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,140
This is

13
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,110
a four-piece bedding set.

14
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,340
It's for your bed.

15
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
Now, for the important part.

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,160
Have

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,540
a

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,400
baby

19
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,130
soon.

20
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,830
Put these on the bed

21
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,240
when you make the bed.

22
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,270
These are for you too.

23
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,380
May you be sweet

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,930
and happy forever.

25
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,880
Thank you, mum.

26
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,380
Thank you, aunt.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,860
Why are you still calling me aunt?

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,100
Don't you want the money
for the change of status anymore?

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,380
Thank you, mum.

30
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,530
Although this is for you,

31
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,200
Nan Xing will the one who's in charge

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,329
of the money at home.

33
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,640
No problem.

34
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,040
Where are you going

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,210
to put these?

36
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,220
Here or...

37
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,920
We don't

38
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,820
plan to buy a new house anymore.

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,520
We want to use this place
as our wedding room.

40
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,400
After

41
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,040
we get married on Friday,

42
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,970
he'll bring me

43
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,180
here right away.

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,680
Congratulations.

45
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,420
That's it?

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
You want the red packet?

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,980
I'll give it to you on that day.

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm a bit rich already.

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,940
Are you done now?

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,450
I'll get going then.

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,100
His Chinese is so bad.

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,650
How did he become an author?

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,060
Doesn't he know what a wedding room

54
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,780
means?

55
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,430
Looks like I have to make a call

56
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,829
to get some outside help.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,280
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,410
He has always been obtuse

59
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,170
in this kind of thing.

60
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,930
I should've taken him away earlier.

61
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,990
We are the ones who spring this on you.

62
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,180
Where are you going to take him?

63
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,010
My house.

64
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,240
Okay now. We are going to get going now.

65
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,880
See you at the wedding.

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,430
Okay.

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,630
Enjoy your alone time with him.

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,340
You too.

69
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,680
Bye.

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,020
Bye.

71
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,380
Enjoy your alone time with me.

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,890
Likewise.

73
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,180
Are you at the wrong place?

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,440
No.

75
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,130
I've sold the house.

76
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,220
Although there were some twists and turns,

77
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,810
I managed

78
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,950
to buy it back.

79
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,880
How can I let you sell off

80
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,890
a house that you cherish so much?

81
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,230
Why is this here?

82
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,470
If

83
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,570
there's a very challenging job for you

84
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,340
but you won't get paid for it,

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,720
will you accept it?

86
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
What kind of a job is it

87
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,010
to be so unattractive?

88
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,740
Do you want to make a bet with me?

89
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,750
If I can catch it

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,180
within three times,

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,990
accept the job, okay?

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,670
Okay.

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,010
Go forward a little bit.

94
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,400
Come over here a little bit.

95
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,010
I admit defeat. Let's go.

96
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,909
I want to start a company.

97
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,460
I want to create our own reading platform

98
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,930
so that I can publish the books

99
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,570
of those unrecognised authors
who are like me in the past.

100
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,080
Even if you can start a company,

101
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,140
who will manage it?

102
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,990
I will.

103
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,600
Am I going

104
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,950
to lose the chance to say yes to you?

105
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,990
[You've done too much for me.]

106
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,940
[It's time for you to rest.]

107
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,800
[I like you.]

108
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,130
[But I want to set you free.]

109
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,180
[This time, let me lead the way]

110
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,740
[to do the things that we like together.]

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,790
I chose

112
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,150
the style that I like.

113
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,290
You are fine with that, right?

114
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,670
Ye Qing.

115
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,980
Thank you

116
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,700
for showing up in my youth

117
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,970
and sticking to my side

118
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,030
without wavering.

119
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,670
Thank you for realising my dream

120
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,680
together with me.

121
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,970
To become mature
and grow up together with me.

122
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
The happiest thing in my life

123
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,120
is when you

124
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,750
choose me without a doubt.

125
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,080
So, can you

126
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,390
choose me again?

127
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,380
Will you marry me?

128
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,600
Yes, I do.

129
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,070
This is during their graduation, right?

130
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,750
They are so fortunate.

131
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,020
Can the three of you control yourself

132
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,700
from being so envious?

133
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,790
We are just happy

134
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,180
for Nan Xing.

135
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,860
That's right.

136
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,650
Moreover,

137
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,490
can't you let us

138
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,500
swoon over love?

139
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,300
You can.

140
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,310
After all, the three of us

141
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,640
will be single forever.

142
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,290
I'm totally

143
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,720
different from you two.

144
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,100
I can get married

145
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,660
at any time.

146
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,960
Who will believe you?

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,720
What are you chatting about so happily?

148
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,690
-Boss.
-Miss Ye.

149
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,440
Boss.

150
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,040
We are talking

151
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,850
about whom will get married next

152
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,530
in our company.

153
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,210
It'll depend on

154
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,190
who can catch

155
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,640
the bridal bouquet later, right?

156
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,730
I'll fight for it.

157
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,700
Don't fight me for it.

158
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,460
Don't fight me for it.

159
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,800
Okay now. I'll check on Nan Xing first.

160
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,180
Okay.

161
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,130
Why are you following me?

162
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,020
I'll go in with you.

163
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,160
Men

164
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,750
can't enter the bride's room.

165
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,930
Not even the groom is allowed to enter.

166
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,230
You can just wait outside.

167
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,080
Where should I wait for you?

168
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,390
What I mean is,

169
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,820
you can do whatever you want.

170
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,990
Take photos with them.

171
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,850
Chat with them.

172
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,310
Boss, let's take a photo together.

173
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,400
Come.

174
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,910
Okay.

175
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,130
Come.

176
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,710

Come.

178
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,280
-Don't go.
-Okay, why did you go?

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm sure you can tell, right?

180
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,900
It's obvious

181
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,210
who will be the next couple

182
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,800
to get married.

[I'm really lucky.]

203
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,740
This girl

204
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,780
is a little bit silly,

205
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,010
a little bit dumb,

206
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,000
a little bit cute.

207
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,700
But

208
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,470
she's the simplest person

209
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,630
and the purest person I know.

210
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm not her real mother.

211
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,250
Mum.

212
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,370
But

213
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,380
she's the most exceptional person to me

214
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,230
in my life.

215
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,300
Now,

216
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,660
I'm going to hand her over to you.

217
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,430
For the rest of your life,

218
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,680
love her well

219
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,910
and protect her well.

220
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,180
Don't worry, mum.

221
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,620
I'll do that.

222
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,600
Okay. Now,

223
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,870
please exchange your wedding vows.

224
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,070
Xiao Wudi.

225
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,120
I feel

226
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,890
like I'm dreaming now.

227
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,950
Just like...

228
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,510
Just like the first time

229
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,480
I saw you.

230
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,140
I thought that I was dreaming too.

231
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,260
You were so annoying.

232
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,890
You suddenly

233
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,530
barged into my world

234
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,510
and messed up my life.

235
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,880
Well. You didn't make it that messy.

236
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,319
It's just that...

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,119
I don't know

238
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
when it happened. But suddenly,

239
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,960
I start to care a lot about you.

240
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,410
I always think

241
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,340
about what you are doing

242
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,770
at all times.

243
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,240
I always want to be by your side

244
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,490
to accompany you

245
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,460
and to be with you all the time.

246
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,030
This is your fault.

247
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,640
You turn me into this.

248
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,720
You have to take responsibility for that.

249
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,470
You dummy.

250
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,540
You won't look pretty if you have
make-up running down your face.

251
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,660
Are you done now?

252
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,410
Yes.

253
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,330
Nan Xing.

254
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,350
From today onward,

255
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,750
I'll be your husband.

256
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,760
Please allow me

257
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,990
to call you my wife

258
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,460
at this moment.

259
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,660
This is my first time

260
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,920
calling you that.

261
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,100
From today onward,

262
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,120
I'll call you that every day.

263
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,720
Thank you, my wife.

264
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,550
I want to thank you.

265
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,740
I have experienced

266
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,580
a lot of firsts in my life

267
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,180
because of you.

268
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,040
We went to the movie theatre
for the first time.

269
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,190
We played on the trampoline
for the first time.

270
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,290
We ate ice cream for the first time.

271
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,430
And there are

272
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,630
many firsts that I can't say here.

273
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,140
Nan Xing.

274
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,790
You know

275
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,720
that

276
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm not

277
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,510
a very good man.

278
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,690
I am

279
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,930
extremely selfish,

280
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,110
arrogant,

281
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,790
and most of the time,

282
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm very childish.

283
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,070
I...

284
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,460
I know that if it wasn't for you...

285
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,410
I forgot my script.

286
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,460
If

287
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,110
it wasn't for your kindness and tolerance,

288
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,720
I wouldn't be a better man

289
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,810
like I am now.

290
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,710
Nan Xing.

291
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,420
No matter it's in the future

292
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,000
or forever after this,

293
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,610
whether it's smooth sailing

294
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,080
or full of obstacles in the future,

295
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll love you without reserve.

296
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,120
I'll accompany you

297
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,460
for the rest of my life.

298
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,820
My wife.

299
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,090
I love you.

300
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,670
Bride and groom,

301
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,590
please tie the knot

302
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,450

692
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,810
after reading the book.

693
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,910
Even if you don't have

694
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,910
a fairy to help you out in this world,

695
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,730
you'll still be able

696
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,230
to find your other half.

697
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,130
That person will appear by your side

698
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,130
to accompany you.

699
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,440
Together,

700
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,870
you'll find the warmth

701
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,930
in your daily life.

702
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,430
Next question.

703
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,730
Nan Xing, hello.

704
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,780
Have you met

705
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,870
your own Xiao Wudi

706
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,800
in real life?

707
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,620
This is a fantasy.

708
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,460
Of course it won't happen.

709
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,810
Until now,

710
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,280
time travel is still not possible

711
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,090
in our life.

712
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,810
But I'm luckier than the Nan Xing

713
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,730
in my book.

714
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,330
Those tragic stories

715
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,630
did not happen to me.

716
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,610
Besides,

717
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,700
I have a childhood friend

718
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,430
who grew up with me since young.

719
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,430
He's the youngest professor

720
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,760
in Sujiang University.

721
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,810
And he's the love of my life.

722
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,720
Mao Xiaojun.

723
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Miss Nan Xing, is your husband here?

724
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,040
He has a seminar today.

725
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,020
He won't be here.

726
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,230
He's so handsome.

727
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,690
He's so handsome.

728
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,630
Nan Xing.

729
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,970
Who is he?

730
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,650
He's so handsome.

731
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,720
So sweet.

732
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,650
They are so well-matched.

733
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,720
Yes. They are so well-matched.

734
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,300
Thank you

735
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,110
for attending my wife's

736
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,370
sharing session.

737
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,720
I hope

738
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,570
that after you read this story,

739
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,830
you can find

740
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,300
your own happiness.

741
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,640
Although

742
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,290
this story is just a fiction

743
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,790
and a fantasy

744
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,510
if you can

745
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,110
find the courage

746
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,130
to face the obstacles in your life

747
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,720
through this story,

748
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,520
the goal

749
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,950
of creating this novel

750
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,500
will be fulfilled.

751
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,480
Am I right?

752
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,910
Yes.

753
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,160
[The novel has ended.]

754
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,100
[But the story between
Nan Xing and Xiao Wudi]

755
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,480
[will continue.]

756
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:49,260
[Mr. Bad, Nan Xing]

757
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
[What about you?]

758
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,060
[Have you started]

759
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,360
[your own story?]
