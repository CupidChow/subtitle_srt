1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,960
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,660
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,340
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,960
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

41
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,020
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

42
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
I'm so sorry.

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,260
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

47
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,320
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

50
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

51
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,220
You're theひèààèèèèèpg this morning,

52
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,920
and let me buy the turban

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,320
for myself today.

54
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,620
In the meantime,

55
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,120
I hope you like it.

56
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,920
No matter how bright this light is,

57
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,820
it's not so dazzling.

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,620
Come on.

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,620
Come and sit.

60
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,580
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,780
Thank you, aunt.

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,820
Is there anything you want to drink?

63
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,380
I want to drink...

64
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,740
I know.

65
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,580
You want me to drink the bottle of wine?

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,340
It's getting cold at night.

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,660
You must keep warm.

68
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,980
Do you want coffee or tea?

69
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,300
It's too late.

70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,380
Hot milk is better.

71
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,380
Here, I prepared some snacks for you.

72
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,900
I'm sorry, your drink is ready now.

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,460
Young Master,

74
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,340
Just tell me. Don't be polite.

75
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,860
How can I be polite?

76
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,620
You work so hard.

77
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,620
I should do all these.

78
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,580
Let me do it.

79
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,780
No need.

80
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,300
Listen to me.

81
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,060
Go sit on the chair.

82
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,660
The chair is heated.

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,300
I'll go.

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,460
What's going on?

85
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,060
Let's get on with the DAMS half-baked cake.

86
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,460
Insane.

87
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,100
You are not done yet?

88
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:51,440
Wasn't she Spain

89
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,820
I should have called her Romano.

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,520
We are doingauerje 🙆🏻‍🛂

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,760
I think I should respect your freedom of creation.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
Write it down yourself.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
Did I do something wrong?

94
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,840
What's the plot?

95
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,760
Can you just say it?

96
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
Is there any problem?

97
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,400
No.

98
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm hungry. I want to eat something.

99
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,480
I'll take you to drink water,

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,640
wouldn't you ask me?

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, should I drink?

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
I'll take you to drink water.

103
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,200
What?

104
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,600
Is there a plot?

105
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,560
I think you should say it.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
What's wrong with you?

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm not tired.

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm just thinking.

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
Thinking how to make your image

110
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,520
more satisfying.

111
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,720
Actually, as long as you write it,

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm satisfied.

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,920
You didn't say that before.

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,520
I was a little shallow before.

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
I thought about it.

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
You're right.

117
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
You do have the right

118
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,720
to write your true feelings honestly.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
You have the freedom to

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,320
make your own works.

121
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,720
Really?

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,520
Yes.

123
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,120
I still have the freedom.

124
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,120
Then,

125
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,320
if I don't want to write here now,

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,720
I can leave.

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
Of course.

128
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
Then I'll leave.

129
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
Okay.

130
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm really leaving.

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,320
Okay.

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,320
I won't come tomorrow either.

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,720
As long as you want to.

134
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,520
Then I'm leaving, Xiao Mi!

135
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
You're so happy

136
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
after returning home.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,120
I can't be angry.

138
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm Nana.

139
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm Nana.

140
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,120
You...

141
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Happiness came so suddenly.

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,120
The first episode ended in a big way.

143
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
My evil neighbor became a Buddha.

144
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,120
She's friendly and thoughtful.

145
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,720
She's going to be a warm man.

146
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
No.

147
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,920
Why did she suddenly become a warm man?

148
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,520
Could it be another conspiracy?

149
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
Forget it.

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
What conspiracy?

151
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,920
I don't care.

152
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,520
I'll talk to her happily first.

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm leaving.

154
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,920
This won't do.

155
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
What's the big ending

156
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
for the evil neighbor?

157
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,920
The devil is changing the evil to good.

158
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
This is so boring.

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
No.

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,120
I have to add a love line to it.

161
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,520
I'll add a boyfriend to the heroine.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,720
I'll add a type that I like.

163
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
The male star walked home.

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,720
The familiar road has become so unfamiliar.

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Her heart is shaking like leaves in the wind.

166
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,920
She's so anxious.

167
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,320
She doesn't want to face the evil neighbor.

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,920
She hopes that

169
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,120
a warm man will appear at this moment.

170
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,520
She's looking at the hero to save her beauty.

171
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,920
When she's praying,

172
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,720
a warm voice comes from behind.

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Miss, are you okay?

174
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm fine.

175
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm just tired from walking.

176
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,920
I want to sit down and rest for a while.

177
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Remember not to squat for too long.

178
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,320
If you squat for too long, you'll feel dizzy.

179
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,720
This boyfriend

180
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,520
is still the same as Lu Da Xia.

181
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
But he's handsome.

182
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,320
He's obviously a warm man.

183
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,120
He's just being polite.

184
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,120
This is my ideal type.

185
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,520
But why

186
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,320
is he not handsome and not married yet?

187
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,120
Why do I suddenly seem to not know how to write?

188
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,720
Has my ideal type changed?

189
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,720
Or am I too young to get married?

190
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
No, no.

191
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,720
Nan Xing, you're just too tired now.

192
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,920
It's too late. You need to sleep.

193
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,720
When you wake up, your boyfriend will become handsome.

194
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,920
Scholar

195
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,120
That's so handsome.

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
I can't finish anymore!

197
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm not someone who can't write it out

198
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I really can't write it out

199
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm a wolf in the cage

200
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,720
I knew you wouldn't give me real freedom

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
It's too late now

202
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I really can't write it out

203
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
Something's wrong here

204
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,800
Come here

205
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,760
You come here and save me

206
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,000
Si Si, what's wrong with you

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,160
Come here

208
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
Come here

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
slow down

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,160
Hurry up

211
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:12,640
It was yesterday, he led the argument machen to fight again.

212
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,840
It's sogasby.

213
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,660
Look, they are so scared.

214
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,760
Of course.

215
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,600
Wicked kids have their own стен.

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,740
I told you to choose one Blue ini

217
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,280
Don't change

218
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,680
Choose

219
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,520
weさか

220
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,920
Don't hold back

221
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,160
Wow

222
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,440
Red

223
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,480
Something about Yeah

224
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,560
The best

225
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,840
See

226
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,500
It must be

227
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,540
You

228
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
You took so much money from me.

229
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
You know, you're lying.

230
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay, okay.

231
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
The sound is so loud.

232
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
It must be the manager.

233
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
That's right.

234
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Hello, hello.

235
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Come, let's have a talk.

236
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Don't be shy.

237
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
If you have anything to say, just say it here.

238
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Okay, no problem.

239
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
It's like this.

240
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
As the saying goes,

241
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Don't do things without good intentions.

242
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Don't do things without evil intentions.

243
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Look,

244
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
this student,

245
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
since you don't want to take him,

246
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
then should you

247
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
return the management fee and tuition fee to him?

248
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Do you have any evidence?

249
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Evidence?

250
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Justice is in the heart.

251
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
You should

252
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
take the initiative to admit it.

253
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Take the initiative to admit it.

254
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Senior,

255
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
is he here to make sense?

256
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Xiao Lu Di, what are you doing here?

257
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
What are you doing here?

258
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
I'm not.

259
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
This thing,

260
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
although they were wrong,

261
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
but I believe that

262
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
as long as we search for

263
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
justice,

264
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
we will eventually get it.

265
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I want justice, why do I need you?

266
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
I've decided.

267
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
From now on, I'll only use justice.

268
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Okay, fine.

269
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
I think you're quite polite.

270
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Besides, he hit my employee.

271
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
I haven't settled the score with him.

272
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
I won't return the money today.

273
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
You can go back.

274
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Go back.

275
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I can't go back.

277
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
I haven't made it clear yet.

278
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
How can I go back?

279
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Xiao Huo's mouth is quite big.

280
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Use justice?

281
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
You have to have this strength.

282
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Xiao Lu Di,

283
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
if you have any opinions, tell me.

284
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Don't tease me.

285
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Anxin, it's dangerous here.

286
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
You should step back.

287
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
May I ask

288
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
what you want to say?

289
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
What does this mean?

290
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Nothing.

291
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
It's just that we're close.

292
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Xiao Lu Di!

293
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Little girl,

294
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
don't talk nonsense.

295
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
I'm recording the video.

296
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Whoever does it first will make a mistake.

297
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
We can't wrong the good people.

298
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Forget it. I don't want the money.

299
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Don't get into trouble.

300
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I don't want the money.

301
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Don't get into trouble?

302
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
You're not going to make a scene if you affect my business?

303
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Whoever does it first will make a mistake.

304
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Did you say that?

305
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Yes.

306
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Anxin, take out your phone.

307
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
You're on your way.

308
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Don't do this, Xiao Lu Di.

309
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Xiao Lu Di, forget it.

310
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Let's go. We don't want the money.

311
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Xiao Lu Di!

312
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Xiao Lu Di, are you okay?

313
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
What's wrong with you?

314
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
I didn't ask you to do it.

315
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Give me your phone.

316
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
How is it? Did you record it?

317
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I did.

318
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
You're handsome.

319
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
But you're okay.

320
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
You!

321
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Did you see it?

322
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Evidence.

323
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Give it back!

324
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Evidence.

325
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:43,960
Franky Suāi,

326
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,280
You will be in the investigation.

327
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,760
By then, the medical and mental costs

328
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,320
will be paid by you.

329
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
You can calculate how long it will take

330
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,360
and how much time it will take.

331
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,920
Talk.

332
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,000
Pay or not?

333
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Okay.

334
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,000
Pay.

335
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,320
Pay.

336
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,840
Song Qi.

337
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,720
Pay.

338
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,400
Song Qi.

339
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,640
Pay.

340
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,040
Pay.

341
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,360
After that,

342
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,560
we reported to the police station

343
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,120
about the black star gym.

344
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
The money of Xiong Si Si

345
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,480
was also returned.

346
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,480
Great.

347
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,760
Who is the hero today?

348
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Xia Wu Di.

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
What is Xia Wu Di?

350
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,560
Hero.

351
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,080
Hero.

352
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Hero.

353
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,040
Hero.

354
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,360
Hero.

355
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,000
Hero.

356
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
Hero.

357
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Sister.

358
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm really touched.

359
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Thank you so much.

360
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,680
If it wasn't for you,

361
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,440
I wouldn't be able to get the money back.

362
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,960
I will never forget this day.

363
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,440
It's nothing.

364
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Take it.

365
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,080
I will throw it away.

366
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,240
Hero.

367
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,680
Hero.

368
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,480
Hero.

369
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,800
Hero.

370
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,240
You don't even know how handsome you are.

371
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,960
Did you see it?

372
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,560
You are so handsome.

373
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,200
You are really handsome.

374
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,080
I must write this scene in the novel

375
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,320
and keep it in my memory forever.

376
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,880
Those people are

377
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,920
always happy to see the yellow star.

378
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,080
They are

379
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
so good to Xiong Si Si.

380
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,120
They are not good to me.

381
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,920
Exactly.

382
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,000
How can they be good to you, Mr. Xiao?

383
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,560
How is it?

384
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
Do you think I

385
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,040
have returned

386
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
the image in your heart?

387
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,040
No.

388
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,200
You are still the same.

389
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,840
I did

390
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
such a great thing.

391
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,720
I am still the same.

392
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,920
Yes, you are still the same.

393
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,040
You are always

394
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,720
trying to fool me.

395
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,000
You are always lying.

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
You are still the same.

397
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,720
I have been

398
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
so busy these days.

399
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
Yes.

400
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,200
You have been so weird these days.

401
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,680
You did something

402
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,520
so strange.

403
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,360
You are so talkative.

404
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,120
And when we were fighting,

405
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,360
you pretended to be a gentleman.

406
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,640
You are so bad.

407
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,960
You don't need to do this.

408
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,200
I pretended to be a gentleman because of you.

409
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,120
Because of me?

410
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,880
You, Mr. Xiao,

411
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,640
will do things for me?

412
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,400
I did it to make you like me.

413
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,320
You told me

414
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,880
you were afraid of me.

415
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,480
You said

416
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
if it wasn't true,

417
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
you couldn't write it in the novel.

418
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,640
So I deliberately

419
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,880
did a better job these days

420
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
and gave you some material.

421
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,640
Why is it unnecessary?

422
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,720
I didn't mean that.

423
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,200
That's what you mean.

424
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,080
You are deliberately

425
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,360
discrediting my salary.

426
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,200
You are deliberately

427
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,960
hinting at me.

428
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,360
You hate me.

429
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,320
I am not.

430
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,360
I am not.

431
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,200
I am not.

432
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,280
I am not.

433
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,200
I am not.

434
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
I just want to write

435
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
a little bit exaggerated.

436
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,160
I mean it.

437
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
I don't hate you.

438
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,480
Really?

439
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,960
Yes.

440
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,720
I will write it for you

441
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,800
when I go back today.

442
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
That's more like it.

443
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,280
Then you won't be angry.

444
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,360
If you write it well,

445
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,560
I can consider it.

446
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,640
I will write it well.

447
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I will write it well.

448
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,160
I will write it when I go back today.

449
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,720
I will write it after I stay up late.

450
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,120
Is that okay?

451
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,400
It seems to be

452
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,120
a little too much.

453
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,400
Is it because

454
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
in my heart,

455
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
he has always been

456
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,880
the devil in the original book?

457
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
I promised to write it well for him.

458
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,360
I will try it first.

459
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,720
Do you need help?

460
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Are you okay?

461
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,800
Don't talk.

462
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,480
You want a love

463
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,920
that is unforgettable.

464
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,080
I will give it to you.

465
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
I will give it to you.

466
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
I will give it to you.

467
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Get up.

468
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Xiao Mu, don't.

469
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,280
It's okay.

470
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,480
I may not be able to be with you in the future.

471
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,720
Or I can thank you.

472
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,280
Thank you.

473
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Don't worry.

474
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
It's dangerous here.

475
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
You can go back.

476
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
I really wrote it well.

477
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
I really wrote it well.

478
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,280
It seems to be

479
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,280
different from the original big ink head.

480
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,320
Actually, it's not that bad.

481
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Senior,

482
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,640
let me show you

483
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,440
what a beautiful girl is.

484
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
What a beautiful girl?

485
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,320
She is already handsome today.

486
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
As the next step

487
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
of our company,

488
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
I need you to

489
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,920
organize the current IP situation

490
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
and the future direction

491
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,160
of the future IP

492
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,080
in my email.

493
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm going to the airport soon.

494
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,080
So if there are any problems

495
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,160
in the next few days,

496
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
you can call me anytime.

497
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay, Senior.

498
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,680
Okay, that's it.

499
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,280
See you.

500
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,880
Nanxing.

501
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
You heard

502
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
the meeting just now.

503
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Do you have any ideas?

504
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,440
I only know that

505
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,480
our company will train new authors

506
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,960
to publish physical books.

507
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,680
I didn't expect there would be such a complete

508
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,280
IP authorization plan.

509
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,280
If I have a related job,

510
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
would you like to do it?

511
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Of course.

512
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,280
You agreed so quickly.

513
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,880
Why don't you ask me what it is?

514
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,680
In fact, after our company

515
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,680
trains a new author,

516
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,560
it's not just

517
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,080
publishing IP authorization business.

518
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,320
There are also film,

519
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,080
animation, games, etc.

520
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
They are all important

521
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
financial income of our company.

522
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
So this time,

523
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
I hope you are responsible for

524
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,960
your boss's full authorization business.

525
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
I think

526
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,960
based on your understanding of him,

527
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,160
you should be able to bear it.

528
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,760
But I've never

529
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,960
touched it before.

530
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,920
I don't even know

531
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,080
where to start.

532
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,960
It doesn't matter.

533
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,840
Then let's start with

534
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,480
the simplest life-long book.

535
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
I'll come back from a business trip in a few days.

536
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm going to test you.

537
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,960
Study hard.

538
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,680
Okay.

539
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,000
By the way,

540
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
how's your new plan?

541
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Have you finished writing the novel?

542
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,440
Not yet.

543
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,280
I'm writing it.

544
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,240
I haven't submitted it yet.

545
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,480
The deadline for the submission of the draft is coming.

546
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,600
You have to hurry up.

547
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,640
After I come back from a meeting,

548
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,600
I'll decide in a few days.

549
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,600
And you must balance your work

550
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,680
and writing novels.

551
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
I know.

552
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
Remember to keep an eye on

553
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
your boss's schedule.

554
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,480
He said he wouldn't come to the company these two days.

555
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,680
He seems a little depressed.

556
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
I'll go to work first, Mr. Ye.

557
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Okay.

558
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
Maybe no problem.

559
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,720
Is Mr. Lu trying to go after you?

560
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,240
What?

561
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,280
A test for used language?

562
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,000
Didn't you go to the police station a few days ago?

563
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,520
He's so brave

564
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Don't you want to know?

565
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,000
Hello.

566
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,080
Hello, Zichen.

567
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
Where are you?

568
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Nothing. Tell me.

569
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,280
What's up?

570
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,880
Nothing serious.

571
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
I just want to remind you

572
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,600
to check the new writer's draft.

573
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,800
Okay.

574
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,760
What's that sound?

575
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,720
You're not home?

576
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,640
Nothing.

577
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,200
I...

578
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
I just came out to take a breath.

579
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,920
I knew it.

580
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,720
You should have gone out for a walk.

581
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,920
By the way,

582
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,720
how was your climbing yesterday?

583
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,600
I think the doctor

584
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,600
seems to be interested in you.

585
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,080
You seem to gossip a lot recently, Boss Lu.

586
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,840
We've been friends for more than ten years.

587
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,200
It's normal to care about each other.

588
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
And I think

589
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,160
she's a nice person.

590
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,680
I heard that she has a boyfriend.

591
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,440
What a pity.

592
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,080
Zichen.

593
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
I...

594
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,280
What?

595
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Tell me.

596
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,680
Forget it.

597
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,800
I can't make it clear on the phone.

598
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,080
You can go back to work.

599
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,720
We'll talk again when I come back from the trip.

600
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,520
Okay.

601
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,920
I'll hang up now.

602
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,880
Remember to check the draft.

603
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,400
Okay.

604
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,200
Bye.

605
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,320
Bye.

606
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,160
Yes!

607
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,440
I got it!

608
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,440
ZHUGE

609
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
What's going on?

610
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,740
For you and Li Cheng exhausting me

611
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,560
Do not leave me

612
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,880
longer than invite you in this程度

613
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,120
I will always be there for you

614
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,620
for이

615
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,400
Two X

616
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,320
That's more than enough

617
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,480
Just go

618
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:48,960
Let's go

619
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,280
You!

620
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,200
I am madam

621
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Xiao Zi, are you asleep?

622
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Why did you call me?

623
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Why do you need so much money?

624
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I want to start a company

625
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
and create my own reading platform.

626
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I want to create more opportunities

627
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
like I used to.

628
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
You only have one book.

629
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
You want to save the entire industry.

630
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
You're too naive.

631
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Maybe I am naive.

632
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
But I really believe

633
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
that those who like to write like me

634
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
need an opportunity

635
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
to focus on their creation.

636
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
The purpose of starting a company

637
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
is to make money.

638
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,200
You don't need to be an idealist.

639
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Besides,

640
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
do you know the risks

641
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
you will face in your career?

642
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
If the risk is high and the profit is low,

643
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I might as well go to the bank

644
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
and buy financial products.

645
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
This is not fake.

646
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
If the company really starts,

647
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
who will run it?

648
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
I will run it.

649
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Kids nowadays

650
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
are so casual.

651
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
You don't need to be responsible.

652
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Uncle,

653
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Zi Chi's inner novel

654
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
was not a coincidence.

655
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
As long as he keeps writing,

656
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
our platform

657
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
will have enough readers.

658
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
We can also raise more

659
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
outstanding authors.

660
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
With Zichen's talent,

661
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I believe in the future,

662
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
we will have more

663
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
outstanding authors and high-quality works.

664
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
And this industry will also

665
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
grow in the future.

666
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Our company

667
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
will definitely become the center.

668
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
He usually makes you happy.

669
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Then you believe him,

670
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
like him.

671
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Then you come to me

672
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
and cheat me.

673
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Uncle, we are not...

674
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
I am talking to my son.

675
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
We are not the kind of relationship

676
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
you think.

677
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Don't you like him?

678
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
You can't answer me, can you?

679
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,200
I only have a cooperation relationship with Ye Qing.

680
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
I won't like him.

681
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Are you telling the truth?

682
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Come on.

683
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Come on.

684
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Cheers, Wu Ni.

685
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Drink well and eat well.

686
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Okay.

687
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Thank you, Wu Ni.

688
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Brother, I actually envy you.

689
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
If I can be like you,

690
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I can protect Si Si

691
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
and solve problems for her.

692
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
It's nothing.

693
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
I'll teach you

694
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
one or two tricks one day.

695
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Really?

696
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
No, I mean...

697
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
It's okay.

698
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
I'll teach you.

699
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
I'll teach you.

700
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
What do you mean?

701
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
You take me as your apprentice?

702
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Master is above.

703
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Take me as your apprentice.

704
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Get up.

705
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I don't take apprentices.

706
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I'm not the person

707
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,200
you want to protect.

708
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I'll teach you one or two tricks one day.

709
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Maybe you can use it in the future.

710
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Thank you, master.

711
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll take you.

712
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Thank you, Wu Di.

713
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Cheers.

714
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Cheers.

715
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Come on, Wu Di.

716
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Come on, eat well and drink well.

717
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Drink well.

718
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Come on.

719
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Wu Di, you're so good.

720
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Why don't you move your hand?

721
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Okay.

722
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Let's be sweet and gentle.

723
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Don't be ashamed.

724
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Come on.

725
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Why are you laughing?

726
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I think you're a fool.

727
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
What's wrong with me?

728
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
You start.

729
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
What do you think of Xiao Hao?

730
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Xiao Hao is a good person.

731
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
He's got a good personality.

732
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Every time we go out,

733
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
he helps us get things.

734
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
And he always makes us happy.

735
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
As long as we go to eat, drink,

736
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
he always sets a place for us.

737
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Very good.

738
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Don't always say we.

739
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
When you were away,

740
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I didn't see him first.

741
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Come on.

742
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Really?

743
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Come on.

744
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Really?

745
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Come on.

746
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Look at this time.

747
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
He fought with someone for you.

748
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
His hand is hurt.

749
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Now he's drinking with Xiao Wu Di.

750
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Just to help you.

751
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Three, two, go.

752
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Anyway, it's good.

753
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
What's good?

754
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
He's taking you to see his brother.

755
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
You should walk around.

756
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Come on.

757
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Come on.

758
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Who else?

759
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Senior.

760
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
It's time for senior.

761
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Senior.

762
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Xiao Hao.

763
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I'm good, too.

764
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Come on.

765
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Come on.

766
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Three, two, one.

767
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Go.

768
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Come on.

769
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Come on.

770
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Come on.

771
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Come on.

772
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Come on.

773
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Come on.

774
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Xiao Wu Di,

775
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
are you using too much strength?

776
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I'm out of strength.

777
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Come on.

778
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Come on.

779
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Come on.

780
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Be strong, Master.

781
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,200
What are you doing?

782
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
What?

783
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Drink.

784
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Why do you lose, Master?

785
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Drink.

786
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I want to drink, too.

787
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
You're the one.

788
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
You're the one.

789
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm so sorry.

790
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
I'm sorry.

791
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Senior, I've told you so much. Did you hear me?

792
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
I didn't hear you. I didn't tell you.

793
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Do you want to drink?

794
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,200
If you want to drink, you must drink.

795
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Just because you're so handsome and nice,

796
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
I must drink again.

797
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Fine.

798
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Since you're so good at talking,

799
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
you can drink one more.

800
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
One last glass.

801
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I guess you're willing to do it too

802
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,200
I'm used to it every day

803
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I hear the beat of the beat

804
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Your face is so small.

805
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Tell me why

806
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
You're always by my side

807
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Maybe it's the fate of the world

808
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,200
When I see your eyes

809
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,200
That piece of the light in the world

810
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Is love

811
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Tell me why

812
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
You're always by my side

813
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Maybe it's the fate of the world

814
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
When I see your eyes

815
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,200
That piece of the light in the world

816
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Is love

817
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Maybe the atmosphere is good

818
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
My hero can always report

819
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Drive away all my troubles

820
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Every corner

821
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Turned into the soil of love

822
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
A little bit of care

823
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Maybe it represents my heart

824
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Every sunset

825
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,200
The next day we promised

826
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
We get closer and get closer

827
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Like to be your hero

828
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Let's go now

829
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Turn a few thousand suns

830
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Bring a new day

831
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Run with you

832
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
You are the god

833
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Walk through my animal's nest

834
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Accompany me

835
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Occasionally, I'm in your playful smile

836
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Maybe the atmosphere is good

837
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,200
My hero can always report

838
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Drive away all my troubles

839
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Every corner

840
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Turned into the soil of love

841
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,200
A little bit of care

842
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Maybe it represents my heart

843
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Every sunset

844
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,200
The next day we promised

845
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
We get closer and get closer

846
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Like to be your hero

847
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Let's go now
