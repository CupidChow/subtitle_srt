1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Episode 14

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,080
It's so beautiful.

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Come on, mom.

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,640
How many times have you watched it?

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,080
Two different pictures.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,360
I can't watch it enough.

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,280
By the way,

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,840
this is for you.

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,960
This is

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,960
a four-piece suit.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
It's for you to put in the bed.

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
The point is

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
early

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
birth

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
and

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
child.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
When you sleep,

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
put this on.

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,160
And this is for you.

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
Sweet and sweet.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,760
A lifetime of happiness.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you, mom.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Thank you, aunt.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
Why are you calling me aunt?

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,600
You don't want the change of payment?

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Thank you, mom.

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
Although this is for you,

58
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,040
it's your family's money.

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
You can take care of it.

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
No problem.

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
Which side are you going to put this on?

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
This side or...

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
We don't plan to buy a new house.

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
We want to use this as our wedding room.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
After the wedding on Friday,

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we'll have a little party.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll have a little party.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We'll have a little party.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We'll have a little party.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We'll have a little party.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
After the wedding,

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
he'll marry me here.

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Congratulations.

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
That's it?

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Red envelope.

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'll give you the red envelope.

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,200
I've already spent a lot.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you done?

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm leaving.

80
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
His Chinese is so bad.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
How did he become a writer?

82
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
He doesn't know what a wedding room is.

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
It seems that I can only make a phone call

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
and ask for help outside.

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
He's been a little slow in this area.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
I should have picked him up earlier.

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
It's just that we're too sudden.

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Where are you going to take him?

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
My house.

91
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Let's go.

92
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,800
Okay.

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Then we'll leave first.

94
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
See you at the wedding.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Okay.

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Enjoy your time.

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
You too.

98
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Bye-bye.

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Bye-bye.

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Enjoy the time.

101
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
You too.

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Bye-bye.

103
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Truly a true love resisted,

104
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
But I still bought her the milky way back.

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
You treasure your house,

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,800
how could it be sold to someone else easily.

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
What are you doing?

108
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,080
If there's a job that doesn't have a salary

109
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
but is very challenging,

110
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
would you accept it?

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,320
What job?

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
You don't have a good idea?

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Do you want to make a bet with me?

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,080
If I can catch him within three times,

115
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
will you promise me?

116
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Okay.

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
The first one.

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Okay.

119
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll get a little closer.

120
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm willing to give up. Let's go.

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
I want to start a company.

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Be our own music platform.

123
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Give more to the author like me.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Give more to the author like me.

125
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
The company is really open. Who will run it?

126
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I'll run it.

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I don't have a chance to love you.

128
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
The first one.

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
You've done so much for me.

130
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
It's time to rest.

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
I like you.

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
But I want to give you

133
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
the real freedom.

134
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
This time, I'll take you

135
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
to do what we like together.

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll give you the freedom.

137
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I'll give you the freedom.

138
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
I'll give you the freedom.

139
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
I'll give you the freedom.

140
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I'll give you the freedom.

141
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I'll give you the freedom.

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I'll give you the freedom.

143
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I'll give you the freedom.

144
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
I'll give you the freedom.

145
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I'll give you the freedom.

146
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
I'll give you the freedom.

147
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I'll give you the freedom.

148
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
I'll give you the freedom.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
I'll give you the freedom.

150
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Above that,

151
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,320
there'll be more people

152
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
loving each other,

153
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
in order to think and listen to each other's feels.

154
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
I chose my choice.

155
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Do you like it?

156
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Ye Qing,

157
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,040
and stay by my side.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
Thank you for being with me

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
and making my dream come true.

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,400
You grew up with me.

161
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
You chose me firmly.

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,280
It's the happiest thing in my life.

163
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
So can you

164
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,320
choose me again?

165
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,320
Will you marry me?

166
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
I will.

167
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,400
Love Techniques

168
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
In the late night...

169
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,240
They are so happy.

170
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,040
Yes.

171
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,880
Can youitte bored

172
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,680
and frown to each other?

173
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,000
We are happy for a boy.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Moreover, he can't let us be in love.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Sure.

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Who let us three be single?

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm totally different from you two.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm someone who can always get divorced.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Who believes that?

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you talking about?

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Boss Yue.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Boss Yue.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We're talking about who's the next person in our company to do the wedding.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It depends on who can get the wedding bouquet.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have to get it.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I have to get it.

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't get it from me.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll go check on Nanen.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why are you following me?

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to see Nanen.

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Nanen can't enter the bride's room.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even the groom can't enter.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait outside.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then, where should I go?

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, you should go see her.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's take a picture and chat.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Boss, let's take a picture.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay.

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Come on.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Come on.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why are you leaving?

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're so annoying.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now you see it.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who's the next person to do the wedding?

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Obviously.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm going to the wedding.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm going to the wedding.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to the wedding.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm going to the wedding.

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm going to the wedding.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to the wedding.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm going to the wedding.

216
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to the wedding.

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm going to the wedding.

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm going to the wedding.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm going to the wedding.

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm going to the wedding.

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to the wedding.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to the wedding.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm going to the wedding.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to the wedding.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm going to the wedding.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm going to the wedding.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going to the wedding.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm going to the wedding.

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm going to the wedding.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm going to the wedding.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm going to the wedding.

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm going to the wedding.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Today, Xiao Wu Di and I are going to remember

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the us that started from today.

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Xiao Wu Di, thank you

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
for letting me find my love that I've been longing for.

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Nan Xing, thank you

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
for letting me become your love that I've been longing for.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Thank you.

240
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you.

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Thank you.

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you.

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Love that is so heartless.

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Xiao Wu Di, I'm telling you,

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm really very happy.

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Nan Xing, I'm telling you,

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm really very lucky.

251
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Xiao Wu Di, I'm telling you,

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm really very happy.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Thank you.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you.

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm telling you,

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm really very happy.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Thank you.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm telling you,

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm really very happy.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Thank you.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This girl is a little stupid,

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
a little stupid,

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
a little adorable.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But she is the simplest and purest.

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Although I am not her real mother,

267
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:34,000
she is the most special thing in my life.

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now I am going to give her to you.

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Protect Yusheng.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Love him well.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Protect him well.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't worry, mom.

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I will definitely do it.

274
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay, please exchange your marriage vows.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Xiao Ye.

276
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I think I am not the most beautiful woman in the world.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's like I am dreaming.

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's like when I first saw you,

279
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I thought I was dreaming.

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You are really annoying.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You suddenly broke into my world.

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You made my life a mess.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Not a mess.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's like...

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's like I don't know when I became very concerned about your mood.

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I always think about what Xiao Wu Di is doing at this time.

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I always want to stay by your side.

288
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I want to be with you forever.

289
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Dong Hua and Mingyue.

290
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You made me like this.

291
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You have to be responsible for me.

292
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Silly.

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You are not beautiful when you cry.

294
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Are you done?

295
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

296
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Nan Xin.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
From today on, I am your husband.

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Please allow me to call you wife at this moment.

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is the first time I call you like this.

300
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
From today on, I will call you every day.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Thank you, Lao Hua.

302
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I want to thank you.

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You are the first time I experienced a lot in my life.

304
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The first time we went to the movies.

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The first time we went to play in the bed.

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The first time we ate ice cream.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And a lot of...

308
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I can't say it here for the first time.

309
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Nan Xin.

310
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know that I am not a good person.

311
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I am very selfish.

312
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Selfish.

313
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I am very childish.

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I know if it wasn't for you...

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I am so selfish.

316
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If it wasn't for your kindness and tolerance...

317
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can't be a better person like this.

318
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Nan Xin.

319
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Whether it's the future or forever.

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Whether it's a smooth future or a difficult one.

321
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I will love you without reservation.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I will love you.

323
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I will walk with you through every part of your life.

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Honey.

325
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I love you.

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Please welcome Qing Yang.

327
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Please exchange your eternal love.

328
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The sun brings a new day.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I run with you.

330
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You are the god.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You walk through my lonely bridge.

332
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Be with me.

333
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Occasionally, I am in your gentle smile.

334
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Maybe the atmosphere is good.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
My hero can always be in time.

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Please kiss your bridegroom.

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Kiss.

338
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The first one.

339
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The most important part of the wedding today.

340
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The flowering part is about to start.

341
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The happiness of a woman who is not married.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's in your hands now.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay?

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Xiao Jing.

345
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Hurry up.

346
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yu Fan.

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yu Fan, hurry up.

348
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Xin Yue.

349
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Luo.

350
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Xiao Zheng.

351
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Xiao Huang.

352
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You can come up.

353
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Right?

354
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Si Si, what are you doing?

355
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hurry up.

356
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Hurry up.

357
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The man who received this flower will be happy.

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He will sing for a long time.

359
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Good.

360
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Good.

361
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Good.

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Good.

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Three, two, one.

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What are you doing?

365
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Sister.

366
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I like you.

367
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I know.

368
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Lower your voice.

369
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
My feet are about to break.

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Really.

371
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Really.

372
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm so tired.

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm so tired.

374
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm so tired.

375
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm so tired.

376
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm so tired.

377
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm so tired.

378
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm so tired.

379
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm so tired.

380
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
My feet are about to break.

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Why do I have to take it by myself?

382
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You are not a TV show actress.

383
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If you don't take it by yourself, who will take it for you?

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let the guests help you.

385
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm going to sleep.

386
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What are you doing?

387
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Give it to me.

388
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So many.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You take it alone.

390
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Give it to me.

391
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Give it to me.

392
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Don't be busy.

393
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, bridegroom.

394
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Bride, go back to your home.

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Do what you should do.

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Go.

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You.

398
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Are we...

399
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay.

400
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Hurry up.

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Is it okay?

402
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,120
You're always by my side

403
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,480
Maybe it's destiny

404
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,320
When I see your eyes

405
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,280
The light of the night is also empty

406
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,280
It's love

407
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Dad

408
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I introduced you before

409
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Hello, uncle

410
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm Xiao Wu Di

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Dad

412
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm Xiao Wu Di

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm married to your daughter Nan Xin

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Nan Xin is married

415
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I know I still owe you a promise

416
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I promise you here

417
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I will take good care of her

418
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Love her forever

419
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Love her

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Protect her

421
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Enough

422
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No more trouble

423
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wang Xiao Jun

424
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Thank you

425
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I know your wish

426
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I will help you realize it

427
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And mom

428
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I will take good care of her

429
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't worry

430
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Ma Xiao Jun

431
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You didn't see me in a wedding dress

432
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's your loss

433
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You are the most beautiful girl in the whole of Qingqiu

434
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Ok

435
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Since you will be the épée

436
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm happy

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Dad

438
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I imagine when I was young

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,800
Now I finally found my other half.

440
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,600
Although you're not by my side,

441
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
I believe you can see it.

442
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,000
I love him very much.

443
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
He loves me very much too.

444
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's strange.

445
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,600
Shouldn't it be already on sale?

446
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Why isn't it here?

447
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Hello, I want to ask

448
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,800
which bookstore is my book,

449
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
The Rebellious Boyfriend, at?

450
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,400
Why haven't I seen any of them?

451
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Are they still on sale?

452
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,200
They're all sold out.

453
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm not sure if they're still on sale.

454
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
They're all sold out.

455
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
All sold out?

456
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Yes, they're all sold out this afternoon.

457
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
This book is selling very well.

458
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
They're asking for more.

459
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I think they'll have to wait until it's on sale.

460
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,800
Why don't you come back next week?

461
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
No, it's on fire.

462
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
Didn't you read the hot search?

463
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Lu Zichen recommended this book today.

464
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Look.

465
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
Lu Zichen asked the bookseller who came through

466
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
if they could have children.

467
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800
Okay.

468
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Lu Zichen asked if I could have children.

469
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
He can even ask this kind of question?

470
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
He's definitely not talking about you.

471
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,400
He's probably just thinking about the logic.

472
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Don't be angry.

473
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,800
Logic?

474
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I don't care.

475
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Let him delete it.

476
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,800
How can you delete a book that's been forwarded hundreds of thousands of times?

477
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
And this is a kind of publicity.

478
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,000
It's a good thing.

479
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
You can make money if you're hard-working.

480
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
It's worth celebrating.

481
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay.

482
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Celebrate it.

483
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
How?

484
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
Celebrate it with the child.

485
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,400
Who would have such a childish reason to have children?

486
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
Then do you want to or not?

487
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
I want to.

488
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
Who wants to?

489
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,200
Wait.

490
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,600
You have to find a job first.

491
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,400
I can...

492
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,000
I can't raise them.

493
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,600
Press this button.

494
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,800
Press it. Press this button.

495
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Okay.

496
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,800
I'll play it for you.

497
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
104 degrees.

498
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,600
104 degrees?

499
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Then I'm dead.

500
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
The meal is ready.

501
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,800
Little Wu Di, change the plate.

502
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
Wait for me.

503
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Xi Xi.

504
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Little Wu Di.

505
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,800
Lu Zi Chen, what's going on?

506
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,400
You're making it so messy.

507
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Little Wu Di, he keeps asking them to put these things.

508
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Lu Zi Chen made it.

509
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I've been doing it wrong.

510
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,800
How can you two be so difficult to raise a child?

511
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Xi Xi.

512
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
Mom.

513
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,600
Are you having fun?

514
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Are you having fun?

515
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,800
Okay, mom.

516
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Let's go to the washroom and eat, okay?

517
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,200
Let's go to the washroom and eat, okay?

518
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,000
Which one do you want?

519
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
How was the scene today?

520
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,800
Did you have a good time?

521
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,600
It was smooth.

522
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,000
No problem.

523
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Okay.

524
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,000
Did Wu Di go to the signing event?

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,400
He didn't go.

526
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,200
I didn't let him go.

527
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,800
He has something to do at school.

528
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
I was thinking,

529
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,800
it's not the first signing event.

530
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,000
You shouldn't go in person.

531
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,800
No.

532
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I'll take care of every signing event.

533
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
Let him go.

534
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
He's more popular than me at the signing event.

535
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
Of course.

536
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,400
My wife is better than you.

537
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,200
No.

538
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,000
Wu Di is right.

539
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
I agree.

540
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Let's eat.

541
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,400
Let's eat.

542
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
Can you two eat well?

543
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
One whole piece of skin.

544
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Xi Xi, have one.

545
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,800
Xi Xi, have one.

546
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,600
Big piece.

547
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,200
This one is big.

548
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,800
This one is still not finished.

549
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,600
Impossible.

550
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
You...

551
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,560
Such a useless, useless, ugly,

552
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,800
and vulgar woman.

553
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Xi Xi,

554
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,800
I really am sorry.

555
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,000
Uncle Long.

556
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Let me give you this.

557
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Thank you.

558
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Congratulations.

559
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,360
I really became the person I wanted to become the most.

560
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,400
I am like the writers I have been looking up to.

561
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,960
I used my work to accompany everyone.

562
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,400
I brought hope and strength to everyone.

563
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,840
Thank you.

564
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Give this to your girlfriend.

565
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,880
Thank you.

566
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,840
I will give you a piece of paper.

567
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,640
Thank you.

568
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,920
The person behind is filming me.

569
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
I will sign for you.

570
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
You can hold my hand.

571
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
You can also take a picture of me.

572
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Sure.

573
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Thank you.

574
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,240
Let's take a picture.

575
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Thank you.

576
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Ye Ma.

577
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,280
Xiao Di became the youngest archaeology professor in Su Jiang University.

578
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Xi Xi, I have already...

579
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,480
He also became a father.

580
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
But none of these changed him.

581
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
You are still holding hands at the signing event.

582
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
You still have to hold it for so long.

583
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,480
Fine.

584
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I will sign at the signing event.

585
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
I will forbid male readers to enter.

586
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,280
Is that okay?

587
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
That's more like it.

588
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,280
Mom, why is it called Fairy Palace?

589
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Is there really a fairy in the spring?

590
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
I don't know if there is a fairy in the spring.

591
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
But this place is full of memories.

592
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Mom and dad met here.

593
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Come, hug.

594
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I want to hug you.

595
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Go home.

596
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Have you seen the fairy?

597
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
No.

598
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
It's been a long time.

599
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
You probably won't leave.

600
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
That's not necessarily.

601
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
The fairy said that

602
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
she wanted me to treat every day as the last day.

603
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
She wanted you to cherish me.

604
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Now that I have a daughter, you don't like me anymore.

605
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,280
You are the one who doesn't like me anymore.

606
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Okay.

607
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
I like you both.

608
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I like you both.

609
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Look at how petty mom is.

610
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Xiao Wu Di is still the original demon.

611
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Until the end, men don't know

612
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
that the wish that Mao Xiao Jun made

613
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
is for the rest of his life.

614
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
It's before the doctor is gone,

615
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Xiao Wu Di will never leave him.

616
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
That's the final ending

617
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
of my anti-semitic boyfriend.

618
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Thank you.

619
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
I'll leave the rest to you.

620
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
You can ask questions.

621
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Hello, Nan Qing.

622
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
Although this is a fictional story,

623
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
many details are very real.

624
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
You used a realistic pen to create

625
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
a very realistic fantasy.

626
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
I was very touched after reading it.

627
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
So I want to ask

628
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
what your original intention was.

629
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
I wanted to make a story full of hope.

630
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
I want those who are temporarily

631
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
lost in their memories

632
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
to regain confidence in life

633
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
after reading this book.

634
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Even if there is no fairy to help in this world,

635
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
you can definitely

636
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
find your own lover.

637
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
He will come to your side,

638
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
accompany you, and with you

639
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
find the warmth in your daily life.

640
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Next question.

641
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Hello, Nan Qing.

642
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Did you meet Xiao Wu Di in real life?

643
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
This is a fantasy story.

644
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Of course it can't be real.

645
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Until now,

646
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
in our real life,

647
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
there can't be any cross-reaching incidents.

648
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
But I'm luckier than Nan Qing in the book.

649
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I've never had those sad stories.

650
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
And my childhood sweetheart

651
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
grew up with me.

652
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
She is the youngest professor

653
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
in Sujiang University.

654
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
She is also my current lover, Mao Xiao Jun.

655
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Did Nan Qing bring your husband here?

656
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
She has a seminar today.

657
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
She won't come.

658
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
What's going on?

659
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
So handsome.

660
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Nan Qing.

661
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
What's going on?

662
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
So cute.

663
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
So cute.

664
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
So cute.

665
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
So cute.

666
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Thank you very much

667
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
for coming to my wife's reading and sharing event.

668
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I hope after reading this story,

669
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
you can also find

670
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
your own happiness.

671
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Although the story is fake,

672
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
it's a fantasy,

673
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
but if you

674
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
can find the real you

675
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
in the story,

676
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
the courage to face the difficulties in real life,

677
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
then the meaning of this novel

678
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
will be realized.

679
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Am I right?

680
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Yes.

681
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
The novel is over for now.

682
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
But Nan Qing and Xiao Wu Di's story

683
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
will continue.

684
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
What about you?

685
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Has your own story

686
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
started?

687
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm so tired.

688
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
I'm so tired.

689
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
I'm so tired.

690
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
I'm so tired.

691
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
I'm so tired.

692
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm so tired.

693
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
I'm so tired.

694
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm so tired.

695
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I'm so tired.

696
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
I'm so tired.

697
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
I'm so tired.

698
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
I'm so tired.

699
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
I'm so tired.

700
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm so tired.

701
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
I'm so tired.

702
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I'm so tired.

703
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm so tired.

704
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm so tired.

705
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I'm so tired.

706
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
I'm so tired.

707
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
I'm so tired.

708
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
I'm so tired.

709
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
I'm so tired.

710
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
I'm so tired.

711
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
I'm so tired.

712
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm so tired.

713
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
I'm so tired.

714
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
I'm so tired.

715
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:10,240
caught I

716
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Exhale

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,200
Turn around Some earth

718
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,680
I want to run with you on a brand new day

Maybe it's the atmosphere

723
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,200
My hero can always run away in time

724
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,400
