1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
will only allow the

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,480
love words to be vague can't solve

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,120
the present times

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Guess who is the most touching story

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the time I met you

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Before the promise, I left the pen

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
To call out my name

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In the distant space, I hear you

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You are destined to be with me

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Come to me, stay with me

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You are the destiny that can't be changed

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Come for me, stay by me

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Once you look back, fill my heart

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be with me

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In the autumn, you hold the beauty in your hands

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Warm hands and warm hearts

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Youleme invites you to watch the wonderful moment

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mr. Chen is free tonight

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's go to the last secret room together

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ok, I promise you

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But don't call Xiong Sisi and the others

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They are too stupid

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They can't play with us

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just the two of us

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hold on

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We are almost there

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm fine

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm fine

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have nothing except heartache, headache and headache

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You started to be uncomfortable yesterday

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why did you hold on?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It affects your work

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is it more important than work?

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll tell you next time

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Where is the key?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ok

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's almost time

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Show me

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
42 degrees

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We should go to the hospital now

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ok, I overworked

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Maybe it's not fixed just now

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll try again

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why is it so serious?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We should find a way to go to the hospital

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ok, you can have a look

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
37 degrees

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The thermometer

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is the thermometer broken?

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm fine

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No need to go to the hospital

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It seems not burnt

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Maybe it's just a cold

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Pour a bowl of porridge

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Drink it

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And have a good sleep tonight

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tomorrow is fine

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have some work

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have to go now

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Take it

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm leaving, drink it

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Wait

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your hand is not hot

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is it not hot?

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm fine

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I just have a headache

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have no strength

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why are you so careless?

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's ok, I can do it myself

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll pour you another bowl

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ok

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll feed you

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm done

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ok, you should go to sleep

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are leaving so soon?

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I really have work

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Go to sleep

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My nose is bleeding

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My nose is bleeding

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Brother

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Brother

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You are awake

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How could this happen?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes, why are you bleeding?

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you feel uncomfortable now?

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can you wait for me to fall asleep?

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ok

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Go to sleep

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go to sleep

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Go to sleep

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where are you going?

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going out

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Come back if you need me

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So mysterious

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It smells so good

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Making porridge in the morning

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What do you mean?

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You want to compete with me?

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm not going to compete with you

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm going to make porridge for you

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ok

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll go to sleep

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going to sleep

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to sleep

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You want to compete with me?

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So bad

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Xiaodi

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll make porridge for you

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Pour some here

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You can drink it when it gets cold

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can drink the rest when you are hungry

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You don't burn it

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
How do you feel?

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you feel uncomfortable?

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What should I do?

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I can't take you to the hospital

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Actually I have this problem since I was a kid

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is it because I have blood?

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have a bad health

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I feel so sick

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I feel so sick

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Unless

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Unless what?

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Forget it

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I won't say it

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Unless what?

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't say half

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I feel so sick

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's all about my mood

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If there is someone

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who can take care of me

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Who can chat with me

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I feel so good

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Maybe I will get better soon

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's not impossible

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Wait for me

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Xiaoxing

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why are you sick?

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hurry up

143
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why is aunt here?

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why is aunt here?

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You can tell me if you need anything

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't be polite to aunt

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My mom doesn't have to work today

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let her accompany you

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's not good, aunt

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Why don't you have to go to work today?

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There are not many performances of the dance group

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can go once or twice a week

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Mom, you accompany her

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll go to work first

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ok, ok, ok, don't worry

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ok, take care of yourself

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Drink porridge

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Drink some more porridge

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No need, aunt

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can do it myself

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You are so sick

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How can you do it yourself?

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Come here

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's okay, I can do it myself

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can do it myself

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can you do it?

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't drink so fast

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's dry

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll give you more

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No need, aunt

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I feel dizzy

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you ok?

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I want to sleep for a while

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ok

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Cover your nose

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Sleep

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Morning, brother Hito

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Morning, sister Lian

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Morning

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Boss, why are you here?

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm waiting for you

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait for me?

187
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You are going to...

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are going to...

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Boss, what's wrong with your friend?

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You said last time

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let them plan more coincidences

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
My friend did it

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And he asked her out for the exhibition

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And he said

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He asked her out for the exhibition

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because he likes it

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But Mr. Ye

198
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Still doesn't understand what he means

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Do you think my friend

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Should continue to ask her out?

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Wait, boss

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You ask too many questions

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know which one to answer

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Just tell me your feeling

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
My feeling

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think it's weird

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
An adult couple

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Suddenly go out alone

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And they meet many times

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
People usually think too much

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
How can Mr. Ye not think too much?

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Not suddenly

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They used to go out alone

214
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What do you mean?

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Before Mr. Ye became the CEO

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They used to go out alone

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Basically, it's every day

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No way, you...

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They...

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They all do it for work, right?

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes, is there any problem?

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's...

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You should...

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Your friend should think more

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
From Mr. Ye's point of view

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Think about what?

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
According to you

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. Ye is a person who is in a state of work

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Every hour and every minute

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He will take everything as work

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But he will have time to not work

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It makes sense

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It makes sense

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It makes sense

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know if Xiao Wu's fever is gone

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you feeling better?

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's okay

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm really fine

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, you used to cover too little

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't feel cold at all now

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Aunt said you are cold

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Cover it

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll go boil some water for you

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you, aunt

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why doesn't Xiao Wu reply to WeChat?

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why doesn't my mom answer the phone?

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Is she getting worse?

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Nan Xing

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Have you prepared the materials for the meeting?

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm preparing

251
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Xiao Xiong

252
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You've been here for half an hour

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Are you okay?

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Aunt

255
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm fine

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Are you going to stay a little longer?

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I may need a little longer

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I know

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll go to the bathroom

260
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll go to the bathroom

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll go to the bathroom

262
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll go to the bathroom

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll go to the bathroom

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Xiaoxiong

265
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What's wrong, aunt?

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I want something for you

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I need your help

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I need your help

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Then the termination of the signing meeting

270
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
in the last three months

271
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is probably like this

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yufan

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You are responsible for our local

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
partner

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
to connect the schedule

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and the venue

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Nan Xing

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The boss's hotel and ticket

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You are responsible for this time

281
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay?

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Then that's it

284
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Dismissed

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Dismissed

286
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What's wrong with this kid?

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're back

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Mom, why are you here?

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Where am I if I'm not here?

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why didn't you go to take care of Xiaoxiong?

291
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He's fine

292
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's okay so soon?

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's okay at noon

294
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So early

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What are you cooking?

296
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm cooking porridge for Xiaoxiong

297
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Just right

298
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I also want to come back

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and make him something

300
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There's nothing strange

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
in this porridge, right?

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't do innovation today

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm sick

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's not do art

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's good

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can put some vegetables

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and meat in it

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll wash some cabbage

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This disease is getting worse

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's really good

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Really good?

313
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
My mom is amazing

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
She cooked porridge for you

316
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I added two eggs

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
for you

318
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I just came to see you

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm relieved that you're fine

321
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll go first

322
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It seems that I have to change it

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I really don't know how to write

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Or

325
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm just not suitable for writing original

326
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll go to the bathroom

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's out of power

329
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Is there power in your room?

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No power

332
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What happened?

333
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't know

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll go and check the electric bill

335
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What happened?

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,400
You and the others are all on the light

337
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,240
I'll go find the phone of the power company

338
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
Call and ask

339
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,160
it is good

340
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,520
Scared me

341
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,480
What are you doing

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,640
What are you pretending here

343
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,400
I pretend

344
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Are you okay

345
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,440
Who are you

346
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,160
Aunt

347
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,760
Little bear

348
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,760
You are you are

349
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,720
I just bought something back

350
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,880
Your power is out

351
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,920
Yes, I don't know why

352
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,320
Do you have electricity over there

353
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
Let me see

354
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,520
No electricity

355
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,840
strange

356
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
Why is there no electricity in our house

357
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
It should be a route failure

358
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
This problem

359
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,840
Can't be fixed so soon

360
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
And today it's so late

361
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,160
No one should come to fix it

362
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,120
Or you can be here

363
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,160
Resist for one night

364
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,320
Okay

365
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
There is no other way

366
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,920
It's so late

367
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,520
No electricity

368
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,080
We can't even wash the dates

369
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,360
I think tonight

370
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,040
Resist here on the little bear

371
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
Then I'll go back and pack some daily necessities

372
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
This bear

373
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,160
Cute

374
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,360
The hairline is so high

375
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,000
The eyes are so wide

376
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,680
So big

377
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,640
Where is it cute

378
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,560
No little bear is handsome

379
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,200
Not cute

380
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,840
How cute

381
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,640
You are so beautiful

382
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,120
Really not with me

383
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,520
It doesn't look like my real life

384
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,560
Why are you here

385
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,120
Don't talk about me

386
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,040
Don't cry

387
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,200
I take it back

388
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,600
Not real life

389
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,680
Deadly real life

390
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,360
Enough, mom

391
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,080
Take it

392
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,000
Aunt

393
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,880
Su, I've packed it for you

394
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
You are there tonight

395
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,840
Save a little

396
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
Little bear, I'm so sorry

397
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
You just got better

398
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,680
Have to take care of us

399
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm sorry to trouble you

400
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,440
It's okay

401
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,680
This is what it should be

402
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
As the saying goes

403
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,640
It's better to be far away than near

404
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,520
Besides, this is your own home

405
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,400
You can live as long as you want

406
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,520
You are generous

407
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
You paid the rent

408
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
What rent

409
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,840
House rent for the second half of the year

410
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
Then why are you in a hurry

411
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
It's empty

412
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,120
Let the little bear live

413
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,480
Little bear

414
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
If he asks you for more rent

415
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,840
You find me

416
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,600
I'll do it for you

417
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,600
Thank you, aunt

418
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,360
By the way, I just adjusted the hot water

419
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,640
Auntie, do you want to go to the washroom first

420
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm not tired

421
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,440
I'm not tired

422
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,920
What time is it

423
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
I'm not sleepy

424
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Not tired

425
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,560
How can I be alone with Nanxing

426
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,600
One two three

427
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,120
Finally, three people are gathered

428
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,200
Let's fight

429
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,080
Ok

430
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,920
I don't have a poker card

431
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,600
I'll call

432
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,800
I have

433
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,600
Think about it

434
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,120
I want the landlord

435
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,120
I want it

436
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,280
I called the landlord

437
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,600
Is the card so good

438
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,800
This card

439
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,160
Regret it

440
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,640
My card is also too good

441
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,280
Do you want it

442
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,120
You must want me to wash

443
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,240
Because the big cat is here

444
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,280
arrogant

445
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,800
What's the taste

446
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,080
mouth

447
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,440
to me

448
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,840
What card

449
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,360
Let me see

450
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,960
Stick the paper

451
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,880
Come come

452
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,280
it is good

453
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,880
My mom has to get one too

454
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,200
I also stick

455
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,120
You lost too

456
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
You two are a group

457
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,960
Next time I'll come to 789

458
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,240
Buster

459
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,000
There is one more

460
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
Four won

461
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,320
I have three left

462
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,360
nine

463
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,560
out

464
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,680
Do you want

465
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,920
Wang Buster

466
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,040
He won again

467
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,720
Can't drop

468
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,320
Can't drop

469
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,680
One drop and ten

470
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,360
Buster

471
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,800
Won again

472
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,200
Won again

473
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
I'll wash it, I'll wash it

474
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,840
How many are there

475
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,760
Hey

476
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,640
It's so fun

477
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,520
I washed it

478
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,400
We will play every day in the future

479
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,800
It's okay

480
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,480
Stay here next time

481
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,280
Just because there is more

482
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,520
Get along together

483
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Let him do this and that with me

484
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,880
Isn't it easy?

485
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,120
he lives

486
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,120
All equivalent

487
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,280
I'll make a snake

488
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,400
shout

489
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Get up, aunt

490
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,560
Xiao Xiu

491
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,120
Did you do all this

492
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,640
You sit back and have a picture

493
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
That's great

494
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Nan Xing!

495
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Come here, Nan Xing!

496
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Look.

497
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
You made this?

498
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Of course.

499
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
No.

500
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
It's made by Xiao Xiong.

501
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Xiao Xiong, I didn't expect you to be so good at cooking.

502
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
It's far worse than my aunt.

503
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
You're exaggerating.

504
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
How?

505
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I make you breakfast every day.

506
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I see, mom.

507
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
I'll help you eat a bowl of porridge.

508
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
It's almost done.

509
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Xiao Xiong, we won't get up early tomorrow.

510
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
You're so tired and you don't even have a word of thanks.

511
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I don't need it tomorrow.

512
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
We'll move back tomorrow.

513
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I'll find someone from the electric company to fix it this afternoon.

514
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Are you in such a hurry?

515
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Otherwise, I can't stay here forever.

516
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Why not?

517
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Isn't it good?

518
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I don't have any opinion.

519
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
I'm fine with everything.

520
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Nan Xing, check if there are any movies on the market.

521
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
There's a good-looking love movie.

522
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Do you want to watch it?

523
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Sure.

524
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Check if there's a suitable place for it on the weekend.

525
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Okay.

526
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I've checked this area.

527
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I didn't find anything wrong.

528
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I'll check the outside.

529
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Okay.

530
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
What's wrong with you?

531
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
You can't find anything wrong?

532
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,200
What happened to your brother?

533
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
What happened to your brother?

534
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I don't know.

535
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I've never seen anything like this.

536
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,200
If we can't fix it, we have to take the cable off.

537
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Take the cable off?

538
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Will the wall be broken?

539
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
It's too troublesome.

540
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
There's no other way.

541
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
There's no other way.

542
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
There's no other way.

543
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
It's too late.

544
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
I'll go back first.

545
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I'll come back tomorrow.

546
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Okay. Thank you.

547
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
How is it going, auntie?

548
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Xiong.

549
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
We still can't find anything.

550
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
The master said that if we can't fix it,

551
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,200
we have to break the wall and get the cable back.

552
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
It's so troublesome.

553
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Mom.

554
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
You're back.

555
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
You want to break the wall?

556
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
I can't find the reason.

557
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,200
How about I call the power company tomorrow

558
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
and ask them to find a repair worker again?

559
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
How long will it take to break the wall?

560
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
It's useless to find anyone.

561
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
This problem won't be solved so quickly.

562
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I know.

563
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Besides,

564
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
you're living well in my place.

565
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
You don't have to think too much.

566
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Just think of it as your own home.

567
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
But it's my own home.

568
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes.

569
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
It's the same wherever you live.

570
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I'll help you.

571
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Mom.

572
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
What time do you want to watch the movie?

573
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I'll buy tickets.

574
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
I've seen that movie.

575
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Don't order it.

576
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Xiong just ordered it.

577
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Let me do it, auntie.

578
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Okay.

579
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
You must go to watch it.

580
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
You'll like it.

581
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Okay.

582
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I'll go and see another movie.

583
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
You booked tickets for my mom?

584
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I tried the electronic payment today.

585
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I bought a ticket for my auntie.

586
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Where did you get the internet?

587
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I used yours.

588
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I said I had a discount today.

589
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I'll go to Sisi.

590
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
She has seen it.

591
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
I'll go to Sisi.

592
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Okay.

593
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
How about I go with you?

594
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
I haven't seen a movie after I came here.

595
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Are you planning another conspiracy?

596
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
What conspiracy?

597
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I'll show you a movie.

598
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
What benefits can I get?

599
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I wanted to ask you to go with me.

600
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
But I think you don't like that kind of movie.

601
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
How can I know if I haven't tried it?

602
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Then let's go and watch it together.

603
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
What do you need?

604
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
One popcorn.

605
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Thank you.

606
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
One popcorn.

607
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Let's go.

608
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Let's go.

609
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Why did you buy only one drink?

610
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
How could you do this?

611
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
The waiter said this set is more affordable.

612
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Although it's rich,

613
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
you still have to save money.

614
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Wait.

615
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Change the hotel.

616
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,200
This way you won't be ruined by the yellow one.

617
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Eat popcorn together.

618
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Drink a cup of coke together.

619
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
I can't be romantic.

620
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Let's go.

621
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm so handsome.

622
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
So handsome.

623
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
How is this handsome?

624
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
So handsome.

625
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Am I handsome?

626
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Thank you.

627
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Change the pose.

628
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
How is it?

629
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Look.

630
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
So handsome.

631
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Take another one. I'll take it for you.

632
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
So handsome.

633
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Handsome?

634
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm handsome?

635
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Look.

636
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
How is it?

637
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Take another one.

638
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
So handsome.

639
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Come.

640
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Why are you so slow?

641
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
This movie is so ugly.

642
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
If you don't like it,

643
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
why do you come with me?

644
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Go home.

645
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Wait.

646
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Wait.

647
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
I want to watch another movie.

648
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
You watched two movies a day.

649
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Aren't you tired?

650
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
No.

651
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Then I'll watch this.

652
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Youth School.

653
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
National Brother.

654
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
How cute.

655
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Do you like it?

656
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Not bad.

657
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
This is good.

658
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Comedy.

659
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
All are good actors.

660
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
This is good.

661
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Very interesting.

662
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I really want to go home.

663
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I want to watch this.

664
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
This?

665
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
This?

666
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
So good.

667
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
So good.

668
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
So good.

669
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Look at you.

670
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
You can't draw.

671
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
You can only concentrate on me.

672
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Everything is back to normal.

673
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
The power is back.

674
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
It's Chinese New Year.

675
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
So it's so good.

676
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
It's so good.

677
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
That pair of sunglasses

678
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
will soon be on the building of Mr. Tie.

679
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
But Lei, you can't...

680
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I'm sorry.

681
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I'm sorry.

682
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
I'm sorry.

683
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
I'm sorry.

684
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I'm sorry.

685
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm sorry.

686
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm sorry.

688
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm sorry.

689
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm sorry.

690
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm sorry.

692
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm sorry.

693
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm sorry.

694
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
I'm sorry.

695
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I'm sorry.

698
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
I'm sorry.

699
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm sorry.

700
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
I'm sorry.

701
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm sorry.

703
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm sorry.

704
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I'm sorry.

705
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm sorry.

706
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
I'm sorry.

707
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm sorry.

709
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm sorry.

711
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I'm sorry.

713
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm so sorry.

714
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I'm sorry.

715
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,000
We're done with the movie.

716
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Why are you still sitting here?

717
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Sit down.

718
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,400
The movie is over.

719
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,760
Why are you still sitting here?

720
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,800
Let's go.

721
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,360
It's late.

722
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
Why didn't you wake me up?

723
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,520
I just woke you up.

724
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,480
You didn't wake up.

725
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
Today's movie is really nice.

726
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
The story of the male lead is so romantic.

727
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,200
I cried when I saw it later.

728
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,640
I didn't expect it either.

729
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
Is the movie you chose good?

730
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,000
It's good.

731
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,360
Why are you still sleeping?

732
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,800
I'm sorry.

733
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,000
I've been worrying about something these days.

734
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
So I didn't sleep well.

735
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
What are you worried about?

736
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,200
My own business.

737
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,960
You don't understand even if I tell you.

738
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,440
What's your problem?

739
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
You didn't solve it by calling me in the end.

740
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,680
You might as well just tell me directly.

741
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
What's the matter?

742
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,680
Our company has a new project

743
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,200
for the development of new authors.

744
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,120
Mr. Ye wants me to participate.

745
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,840
Actually, I want to go.

746
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,400
But I just haven't got any clue yet.

747
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
I used to write the same person.

748
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,440
Now I suddenly want to write a original novel.

749
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
I don't even know what to write.

750
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,400
Wait a minute.

751
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
You can write novels?

752
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,640
Why don't you show me?

753
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
How can I show you?

754
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,920
What if it gets exposed?

755
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,960
I wrote a love novel.

756
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,160
You don't like it.

757
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,840
It's the same as the first movie we watched today.

758
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,040
It means that the situation is a bit complicated.

759
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,200
I need to think about it.

760
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,960
Write a novel?

761
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
If I help her with this...

762
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,520
Nanxing.

763
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,320
Do you think it's not easy to think?

764
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,880
How can you say that?

765
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,960
I'll change my mind.

766
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,160
Do you think you're not good at thinking?

767
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,920
You've thought about many things since you were a kid.

768
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,280
Have you finished them?

769
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,680
Since thinking is not your strength,

770
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,800
don't think too much.

771
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Just do it.

772
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,720
You're right.

773
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,160
You need to write it to know if it's good or not.

774
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
Yes.

775
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
I support you.

776
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,040
But I still don't know what to write.

777
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
You're not good at thinking.

778
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,120
You even put the obvious topic here.

779
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,960
What topic?

780
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,360
Is it not worth writing about me and you?

781
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
I also want to meet a love that's so hard to get.

782
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,840
What's going on now?

783
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,560
Isn't this kind of love story only in novels?

784
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,120
You can get my heart or my person if you can't get mine, right?

785
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,440
No!

786
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
Before you send me back,

787
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,800
I can only sleep with you every night.

788
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,760
I...

789
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,560
Did I tell you not to disturb me?

790
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,080
You're so funny!

791
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,160
Yes, you can write this story.

792
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,560
Yes.

793
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,480
The story between me and you is so simple.

794
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,160
I can write this.

795
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,000
Yes, I can write this.

796
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Xiao Di, you're so awesome!

797
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,960
I'll write it right now.

798
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,600
The way to connect the power is not a long-term solution.

799
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,920
Even if we don't live together,

800
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,320
you have to come to see me often.

801
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,160
Xiao Di, let's go.

802
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,600
Coming.

807
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,760
Sometimes I'm in your playful smile.

808
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Maybe the atmosphere is just right.

809
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,480
My hero always can catch up with me in time.

810
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,360
All my troubles.

811
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,480
Every corner.

812
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,280
Becomes the soil of love.

813
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,640
Special relationship, a little bit of heart.

814
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Maybe it represents my heart.

815
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,480
Every person, I'm tired.

816
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,560
The next day I promised.

817
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,360
We accidentally get close and make a tacit understanding.

818
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,880
If you like me, I'll be your hero.

819
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,600
Let's go now.
