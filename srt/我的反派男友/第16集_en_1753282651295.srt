49
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
This is so beautiful.

67
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Boss.

68
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,040
So beautiful.

69
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,080
So beautiful.

70
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,640
Boss.

71
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,160
So beautiful.

72
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
Come down and play together.

73
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,800
Boss.

74
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Boss, come here.

75
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Come on.

76
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Come on.

77
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
So boring.

78
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Go take a picture with them.

79
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
Okay.

80
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,760
I want to take this picture too.

81
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,920
Let me do it.

82
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,440
I want to take a picture with you.

83
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,280
One, two, three.

84
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,520
Action.

85
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,240
So beautiful.

86
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Let's take a picture together.

87
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,760
So beautiful.

88
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Let's take a picture together.

89
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,720
I've made up my mind.

90
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
Let's be together.

91
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,880
I know

92
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,560
I was too cowardly before.

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,200
I didn't dare to express myself.

94
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
But I don't want to be like that now.

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
I like you.

96
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,720
Let's be together.

97
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,120
Why don't you say anything?

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,120
Have you really made up your mind?

99
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,200
I have.

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
I'll take all the consequences this time.

101
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,080
It's not a problem that you can take alone.

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,880
Whether we're together or not,

103
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,640
it's not a problem for you alone.

104
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,080
From the first word you said,

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
we can't go back to the past.

106
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,360
I've been trying to persuade you before.

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,320
I can't handle this problem.

108
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,360
But you still said it out.

109
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,120
I really don't know how to answer you now.

110
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,200
If I say yes,

111
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,520
are we going to be together?

112
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,760
Go to the workplace?

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
Get married?

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,160
But I don't know if I can do that.

115
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,400
But if I say no,

116
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,200
am I going to lose a best friend?

117
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,880
No matter what you say,

118
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,560
you won't lose me.

119
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,920
And don't you think this guy

120
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
is too selfish?

121
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,960
He came out of nowhere

122
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,000
and might disappear at any time.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:42,260
He dares to go to the

124
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
workplace?

125
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,140
Yes.

126
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,620
I think sister,

127
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,140
you two still know each other.

128
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,540
No wonder you keep bastards'加 planetary.

129
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,140
Hello, it's Tao Yi.

130
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,420
Your previous works are burned.

131
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,700
That's all for now. Thank you

132
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,420
Xiao Wu Di, help! There's a bad guy!

133
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Xiao Wu Di, come here! There's a bad guy!

134
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
What's wrong?

135
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,420
What happened?

136
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
Where's the bad guy?

137
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
Aren't you the bad guy?

138
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Why are you suddenly summoning me?

139
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,420
Because I want to see you

140
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,420
I'm here to see you

141
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm here to see you

142
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm here to see you

143
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,420
I'm here to see you

144
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
What's wrong?

145
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420
I have something to do. I have to go back

146
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:37,380
Xiao Wu Di, be careful of the

147
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:57,380
I can't be with you, Nan Xin

148
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Why?

149
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
I don't have the current identity

150
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
I came out of thin air

151
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
I might disappear

152
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
I might disappear

153
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
But you're different

154
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Nan Xin

155
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
You need a clear future

156
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
You need a clear future

157
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
But you and I are together

158
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
There will be no future

159
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
I used to think

160
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,380
I can let you take it all

161
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,380
I used to think

162
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
But now I realize

163
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,380
I can be selfish to the whole world

164
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
But I can't do it to you

165
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
So I can't be with you

166
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,380
The future

167
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
Nan Xin

168
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Don't you have a fear of the future?

169
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,380
But this is a place for confession.

170
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,380
So I want to be brave and tell you...

171
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,380
Little Wu Di, I've already lost it once.

172
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,380
Let's leave the future to the future, okay?

173
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,380
This time, I just want it now.

174
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,380
If I miss it now,

175
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,380
no matter what the future will be, I will regret it.

176
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Xiao Wu Di.

177
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Let's be together.

178
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Okay.

179
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Let's go.

180
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
So beautiful.

181
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Hurry up.

182
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Okay.

183
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,380
Hurry up.

184
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Let's go.

185
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,380
It's over.

186
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Then...

187
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,380
should we continue what we did just now?

188
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,380
Is it a bit...

189
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,380
It seems so.

190
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,380
What are you laughing at?

191
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,380
I thought you were bad.

192
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,380
You said I'm bad?

193
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
You need to make it clear.

194
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
I'm not bad with Mr. Huang.

195
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
You're really...

196
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,380
You want to fight with me on the first day of dating?

197
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,380
No matter what you say, you won't lose me.

199
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Why do you think it's so complicated?

200
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
Think about it. When we started our business,

201
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
there were only two of us.

202
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
We were together for 24 hours.

203
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,380
If we're still together,

204
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
wouldn't it be bad?

205
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,380
What if we broke up?

206
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,380
If you're worried about losing your career,

207
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
I can promise you that

208
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,380
I'll leave after we break up.

209
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
How can you leave?

210
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Your work, your dream,

211
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,380
all your family members are in this company.

212
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,380
If you leave, how can the employees...

213
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
I don't care about what you said.

214
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,380
I care.

215
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Do you have no confidence in me?

216
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,380
Let's just pretend that this didn't happen today.

217
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,380
Well,

219
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,380
wait for me here.

220
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,380
What?

221
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,380
Wait for me.

222
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,380
Don't run around.

223
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,380
Give it to me.

224
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Open it.

225
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,380
This is what I made for you.

226
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,380
I hope that when you hear this bell sound,

227
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
you'll want to hear my heartbeat.

228
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,380
I'll be with you forever.

229
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
Do you like it?

230
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I like it.

231
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm leaving.

232
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,380
Then,

233
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,380
rest early.

234
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
I'm leaving.

235
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,380
You're leaving like this?

236
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Yes.

237
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Then I...

238
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,380
I don't have to leave?

239
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
No.

240
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
I mean,

241
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
just now...

242
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,380
that...

243
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Okay.

244
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Nan Xing, are you back?

245
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
That's weird.

246
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,380
I can't hear anything.

247
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Why can't I see anyone?

248
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,380
What time is it?

249
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,380
What do you want?

250
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
What do you want?

251
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,380
I'm going to the bathroom.

252
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,380
Let's go.

253
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,380
What are you doing?

254
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
You're running away?

255
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,380
You're the one who made me run away?

256
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Are you okay?

257
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
I'm okay.

258
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
If he knows we're together,

259
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,940
when tomorrow comes,

260
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,820
the whole company will know.

261
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,580
So,

262
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,980
when we're together,

263
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,820
we should keep our distance.

264
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,460
You women are cold-blooded.

265
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,420
You don't cherish it when you get it.

266
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,660
What?

267
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,460
Okay.

268
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
You should go back and rest.

269
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Right?

270
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
Good night.

271
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Good night.

272
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
Xia Wudi.

273
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,660
Bye.

274
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,380
Go.

275
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,940
You really don't want to wait for me?

276
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,500
Didn't someone say

277
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,220
we should keep our distance?

278
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Let's go!

279
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Xia Wudi.

280
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm really what you don't become

281
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,620
even if you still getiper

282
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,380
from the past

283
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,340
is now what I should do

284
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,060
then starting tomorrow

285
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,340
will be gone

286
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,100
Xia Wu Di

287
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,300
I will not break up with you

288
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,900
What good�

289
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,100
means

290
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,020
would you marry me?

291
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,780
Why should I break up?

292
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,180
Number two

293
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,380
You don't want to say anything

294
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,220
no matter what

295
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,340
I agree

296
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,580
I do

297
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:13,140
Like me, such a little ordinary me

298
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,140
Walked through the four corners of the world, I will find sweet clues

299
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,420
Guess who likes who more

300
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,100
If there is no love novel

301
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:37,140
How to find the lost if there is a mistake

302
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,100
A change of heart for love

303
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,140
Maybe a little dull

304
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,140
Even if the time and place are in a self-contained state

305
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,100
We are lonely

306
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,060
Counting down the future promise

307
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,060
The love is not enough to make me happy

308
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,780
Let's go

309
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,580
Do you want to say

310
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,820
Don't say it again

311
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,500
This grapefruit is so emotional

312
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,220
Nothing

313
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,620
If you don't dare to say it, I'll tell Auntie

314
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,940
Don't don't

315
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,300
This is too sudden

316
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,660
Or wait for us to be stable and then tell him

317
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,420
What is a little bit more stable

318
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,180
Are we not stable now

319
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,820
You are a woman who changes quickly

320
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,620
No, my mother is an elder

321
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,980
The concept of elder to stability is different from us

322
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,580
What's the difference

323
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,020
Auntie An usually wants you to find a partner

324
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,220
Suddenly she found you such an excellent partner

325
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,980
She should be happy

326
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,700
You don't understand

327
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,500
Modern elders and ancient elders

328
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,060
There is really no difference in this

329
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,220
If you suddenly say that to her

330
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,660
Then my mother must be

331
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,660
Be together, be together

332
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,060
Where did you work

333
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,180
Where do you work

334
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,620
Where do you live

335
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,780
How long have you two been together

336
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,900
Just one day

337
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,620
When will that be married

338
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,420
I listen to you

339
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,340
This matter

340
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,140
It's true that we have to wait until we are stable

341
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,180
Right

342
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,340
Don't say it yourself

343
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,380
rest assured

344
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,900
Mom, I'm back

345
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,940
Come back

346
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,540
How are you

347
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,740
Will it go well

348
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,780
Yes

349
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,620
There is nothing wrong with it

350
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,060
Just take it to play together

351
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,260
That place is beautiful

352
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,540
I'll take you there later

353
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,500
it is good

354
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,420
I just saw you didn't post friends

355
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,660
I thought that place wasn't very fun

356
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,860
I was busy later

357
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,900
I was busy

358
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,940
I was busy

359
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,060
I was busy

360
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,180
I was busy

361
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,220
I was busy

362
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,260
I was busy

363
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,540
I was busy

364
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,500
I was busy

365
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,100
I was busy later

366
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,580
Making dumplings

367
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,300
Yes

368
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,620
I want to give you and Xiong a welcome

369
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,820
Didn't Xiong go with you

370
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,500
Why did you come back by yourself

371
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,860
He came back too

372
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,820
Where is the person

373
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,660
At home

374
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,180
Then hurry up and call him over

375
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,020
I prepared three people

376
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,780
This is not good

377
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,060
He just came back

378
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,100
I suddenly called him

379
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,220
How inconvenient

380
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,220
What's inconvenient

381
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,660
It's not the first time

382
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,580
What's wrong

383
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,020
Is there something wrong with you two

384
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,820
We have nothing to do

385
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,660
Then hurry up and call him over

386
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,700
Come and help

387
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,540
OK, I'll go now

388
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,140
What to do

389
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,380
Can't you be calm and calm

390
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,860
Otherwise, I'll tell my mother

391
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,140
You are tired

392
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,180
I'm already asleep

393
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,980
Just go

394
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,060
Anyway, it's not the first time to eat

395
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,420
What's not natural

396
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,140
Yes

397
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,740
It's not the first time to eat

398
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,180
What's not natural

399
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,140
But if you don't go today

400
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,220
We can't get through tonight

401
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,260
Yes

402
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,020
Don't go today

403
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,620
Don't go today

404
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,220
Can't hide it tonight

405
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,980
go

406
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,020
what happened

407
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,340
Hug me

408
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,100
Lan Xi, let you call someone

409
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,620
Why so long

410
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,220
You two are exercising

411
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,660
Okay, okay, don't practice

412
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,260
Let's go, little bear, come here

413
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,820
What are you doing

414
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,020
What are you doing

415
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,700
I can't eat it

416
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,740
You eat it

417
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,660
Little bear

418
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,820
You definitely don't know how to make dumplings

419
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,780
Our Nanxing has been making it since childhood

420
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,900
Especially good at making dumplings

421
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,100
Let Nanxing teach you

422
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,140
That's okay

423
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,580
I don't know

424
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,340
But I learn things very fast

425
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,260
So let Nanxing teach me

426
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,260
I'll get some more noodles

427
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,980
Press this

428
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,700
it is good

429
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,700
I said you keep distance

430
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,020
I said you self-sacrifice

431
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,940
Aunt

432
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,460
I, we take these

433
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,580
Go outside to wrap

434
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,540
it is good

435
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,380
How to wrap this

436
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,140
Then let me teach you

437
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,420
Take a piece of dough first

438
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,340
About a spoonful

439
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,700
Then fold the two sides

440
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,180
Fold

441
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,540
Align

442
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,980
How to do it

443
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,780
I don't know

444
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,180
I don't know

445
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,740
I don't know

446
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,540
I don't know

447
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,260
I don't know

448
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,900
I don't know

449
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,700
How to do it

450
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,140
This

451
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,580
This

452
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,700
What is this

453
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,340
It's like this

454
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,980
The same

455
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,500
You are not safe

456
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,180
I understand

457
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,980
Understand

458
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,940
Is it like this, mom

459
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,460
How is it

460
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,620
There are many bags

461
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,500
Let me guess

462
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,540
This must be a little bear's bag

463
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,700
I made it, aunt

464
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,420
They all said

465
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,180
Who makes dumplings looks like who

466
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,060
How beautiful

467
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,420
Thank you, aunt

468
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Mom, you are in the dumplings

469
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,580
Won't put anything strange

470
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,740
Why do you question my creation every time

471
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,580
I'm really innovative, you know

472
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,780
Don't know art

473
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,460
Look at the bear

474
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,980
I make it every time

475
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,340
It's delicious

476
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,180
Aunt's food is the best

477
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,780
Look, the bear supports me the most

478
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,700
I'll cook this first

479
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,740
You hurry up

480
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,460
Come on

481
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,020
it is good

482
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,380
Pay attention to what you say

483
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,340
what happened

484
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,220
Pay attention to what you say

485
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,340
Wenxing

486
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,580
What's fun about going to the ancient town

487
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,020
Why don't you share it when you come back

488
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,220
Just like that

489
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,780
How is it

490
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,900
pretty good

491
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,700
I must have taken a lot of good-looking photos

492
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,660
Show me

493
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,220
I'll find it

494
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,980
No, these are all photos

495
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,860
Be quiet

496
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,900
I just said no

497
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,980
Mom, I don't know why my phone

498
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,180
Always charging

499
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,140
Is there some photo in the bear's phone?

500
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,180
Open it and show me

501
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,660
I'll find the watch first, aunt

502
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,940
When did you change the phone

503
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,180
I don't want to show my mom

504
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,620
Change the watch

505
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,980
No

506
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,500
I'll give you a call tomorrow

507
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,300
Is it so hard to find a photo?

508
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,020
Come and let me see

509
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:56,900
I said

510
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,660
Locked

511
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,940
Locked

512
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,100
Unlock

513
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,580
Oh my god

514
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,300
This photo you also

515
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,300
Really pretty

516
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,220
Mom, I'll take you to the photo next time

517
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,260
I said it

518
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,060
Take me with you

519
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,620
it is good

520
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,900
That

521
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,500
The dumplings seem to be a pot

522
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,180
My pot

523
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,940
My pot

524
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,380
Why are you two going

525
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,860
We suddenly came up with a few novel ideas

526
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,220
I have to go back and remember it quickly

527
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,460
That dumplings are almost ready

528
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,820
Let's cook it and I'll bring it back

529
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,140
Eat a few more

530
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,260
Eat quickly

531
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,180
No more

532
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,300
It seems that the brothers were almost found

533
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,580
You be careful at home in the future

534
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,060
Your state is too obvious

535
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,660
I know

536
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,380
Oh my god

537
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,340
It's not safe to be in the stairs in the future

538
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,580
This cat also looks at it

539
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,180
It's not safe in the community

540
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Passing by the road

541
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,460
Passing by the road

542
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,460
Passing by the road

543
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Passing by the road

544
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,260
It's okay

545
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,140
Can you put the cat in the house

546
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,740
Go

547
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,000
Or else I'd better go back first

548
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,520
Let's send WeChat messages

549
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:33,380
There is nothing like waiting for the three of us on the street at the

550
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,180
end of our lives, right?

551
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:47,500
Her body is actually decreasing and her body is also

552
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,500
getting weaker.

553
00:32:49,500 --> 00:33:18,260
It would be almost impossible for a peanut to

554
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,620
How about working with me?

555
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,500
Sure.

556
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,300
You're asking me for a favor so soon.

557
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,500
Sure.

558
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,340
Good night.

559
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,020
I miss you.

560
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,300
I miss you too.

561
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
I miss you too.

562
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,100
The concept of seniority for stability

563
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,700
is different from ours.

564
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,860
Where do you work, Xiao Qiu?

565
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,100
How long have you been together?

566
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Just one day?

567
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,860
When will you get married?

568
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,700
I'll listen to you.

569
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,460
Have I solved all these problems?

570
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,940
I don't have to be so secretive in the future.

571
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,020
Mom, I'm going out.

572
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,180
How is it?

573
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,740
Don't you want to see me off?

574
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,220
You're brags.

575
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,020
You're so mean.

576
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,580
Morning.

577
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,940
Morning.

578
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,660
I'm going to work.

579
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,940
See you tonight.

580
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,420
Bye.

581
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
You and me.

582
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,940
I want to forget

583
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,020
the first love.

584
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,140
I'm so happy.

585
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,660
I sigh secretly.

586
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,780
The romance written in the fairy tales

587
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,820
happens tonight.

588
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,060
When the fireflies rise

589
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,140
and light up your eyes,

590
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,780
you'll feel the love.

591
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,460
I'm suddenly sure

592
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,940
that God has given me

593
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
the best star.

594
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,020
Come to me.

595
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,220
Stay with me.

596
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,620
I'm looking forward to it.

597
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,060
I'm flying again.

598
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,740
Come for me.

599
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,980
Stay for me.

600
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,940
I'll keep you in my heart.

601
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,580
I'll give you all my love.

602
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,260
Stay with me.

603
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,900
Come to me.

604
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,980
Love me.

605
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,780
Come to me.

606
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,900
Love me.

607
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,100
Stay with me.

608
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,900
You're the only one

609
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,460
who has been to the heaven.

610
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,180
Stay with me.

611
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,860
Sometimes I'm in your arms.

612
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,260
Maybe it's a good mood.

613
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,180
My hero always

614
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,020
can drive away all my troubles

615
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,460
in time.

616
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,260
Every corner is tired.

617
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,740
Tired of turning into the earth of love.

618
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,140
Special care is like a star.

619
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,660
Maybe it represents my heart.

620
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,940
Tired of every sunset.

621
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,060
Tired of the next day I promised.

622
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,460
We're close by.

623
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,860
I'm afraid of the tacit understanding.

624
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,340
If you like me, I'll be your hero.

625
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,260
Let's go.

626
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
Let's go.

627
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Sometimes I'm in your arms.

628
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Maybe it's a good mood.

629
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
My hero always

630
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
can drive away all my troubles

631
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
in time.

632
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,260
Every corner is tired.

633
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,260
Tired of turning into the earth of love.

634
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,260
Special care is like a star.

635
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,260
Maybe it represents my heart.

636
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,260
Tired of every sunset.

637
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Tired of the next day I promised.

638
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
We're close by.

639
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm afraid of the tacit understanding.

640
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,260
If you like me, I'll be your hero.

641
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,260
Let's go.
