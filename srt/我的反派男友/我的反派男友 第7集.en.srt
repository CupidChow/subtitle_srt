00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Why is there a guy?

179
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,930
Is it you?

180
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,730
Shot it! Shot it!

181
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,610
Behind you!

182
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,290
Why are you lost again?

183
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,330
What did you press?

184
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,280
I don't know!

185
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,780
This...

186
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,360
No!

187
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,610
I...

188
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,800
Aim their heads.

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,730
One.

190
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,690
There are many ghosts here, Xiao Wudi!

191
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,480
Move aside.

192
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,410
I'll let you...

193
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,320
Move away from me!

194
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,400
He's coming!

195
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,290
On the ground!

196
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,840
Behind you!

197
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,760
On the ground!

198
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,090
It's climbing over!

199
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,860
It's...

200
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,010
It's coming to me!

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,650
Move!

202
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,360
Squat!

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,130
You're blocking me!

204
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,400
You're dead, lay flat.

205
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,420
Don't block me.

206
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,920
That's fantastic!

207
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,890
These are all

208
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,169
child play.

209
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,360
So what?

210
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
As long as it's fun.

211
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,730
I'll go now.

212
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,970
Xiao Wudi.

213
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,160
Do you want to play?

214
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:54,730
No.

215
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
It's really fun!

216
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,310
How about this?

217
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,950
We'll play wall-climbing

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,930
and see who's the highest climber.

219
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,730
Aren't you silly?

220
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,280
Look how great he is!

221
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,530
Come up here.

222
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,180
Stand here.

223
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,970
So cool!

224
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,290
Xiao Wudi.

225
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,970
Do you want to slide?

226
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,050
This one.

227
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,970
Can you take one?

228
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,330
Are you human at all?

229
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,960
Scared?

230
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:34,930
Wait!

231
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,050
Let me brace myself.

232
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,870
Push me after I count to three.

233
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,600
Count now.

234
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,680
One.

235
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,400
Two.

236
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Xiao Wudi!

237
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,960
I didn't count to three!

238
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,420
Are you scared?

239
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,680
I'll just count to one.

240
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,510
Hurry up and stop nagging.

241
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,360
One.

242
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,840
Two.

243
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,760
Three!

244
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,010
It's unexpected.

245
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,210
What?

246
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,400
I didn't know

247
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,530
that you're so childish.

248
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,610
Cute!

249
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,000
Cute! I wanted to say this.

250
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,850
Cute?

251
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,000
You're happy then?

252
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,330
Happy is a good word.

253
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
How would you know

254
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,730
if my happiness

255
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
has a different meaning?

256
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,000
How can happiness have other meanings?

257
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,970
It makes no difference
if you know about it too.

258
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm thirsty. I want some milk tea.

259
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,840
There's a milk tea shop there.

260
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,610
Where are you going?

261
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,170
I'm going to the toilet.

262
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
Then I'll buy milk tea.

263
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,280
What is taking her so long?

264
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,120
Welcome, Mr. Lu.

265
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,590
Please return this for me.

266
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,690
I'm really sorry

267
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,280
to ask you here personally.

268
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,040
May I know

269
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,330
the reason you're asking for a return?

270
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,300
Don't worry.

271
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
We're just asking

272
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,130
in accordance to our procedures

273
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,260
to improve our products and services.

274
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,530
She already has one.

275
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,680
Is that so?

276
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,160
Very well.

277
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll proceed with the procedures.

278
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,100
Please hold on.

279
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,640
Mr. Lu?

280
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,800
It is you.

281
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,330
Buying something for your girlfriend?

282
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,840
I bought Ye Qing

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,970
a necklace before.

284
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,090
She said this shop

285
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,090
has intricate designs.

286
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,950
She likes them.

287
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,510
This is the one.

288
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,970
You've just given her a present.

289
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,270
Don't you feel boring?

290
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,960
A necklace is a necklace.

291
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,090
A ring is a ring.

292
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,410
A ring?

293
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,570
Yes.

294
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,010
What design do you think

295
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,870
is suitable for

296
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
a marriage proposal?

297
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,570
How long have you two been together?

298
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,230
A proposal?

299
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,770
I thought so too.

300
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,570
However,

301
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,650
I've been spending time with Ye Qing.

302
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,240
I think

303
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,570
she's the one for me.

304
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
So I want to propose to her
as soon as possible.

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,560
Mr. Lu.

306
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,880
You two have been together
for a long time.

307
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,360
You must know each other well.

308
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,250
I have a plan.

309
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,900
Can you give me some ideas?

310
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,580
I'm planning

311
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,370
to make a small path with candles

312
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,120
and use 1000 pink roses

313
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,090
to create an arch.

314
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,730
Then I'll lead her

315
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,570
to the arch

316
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,010
and propose to her.

317
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,330
When she says yes,

318
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,830
the lights will turn on

319
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,280
to reveal her colleagues

320
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,650
and friends in the dark.

321
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
What do you think?

322
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,210
Mr. Lu?

323
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,940
Does it sound romantic?

324
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,950
It is romantic.

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,660
But the venue is not suitable.

326
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,840
Ye Qing is a person who honours

327
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,050
her work ethics.

328
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,540
She will never display

329
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,060
her affections in public.

330
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,010
You might surprise her by

331
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,360
inviting her colleagues,

332
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,000
but at the same time,

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
she will feel pressured.

334
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,120
So I think

335
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,360
you should do it privately.

336
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,870
Mr. Lu.

337
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,200
Please sign here.

338
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,880
Take a look.

339
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,450
Which one looks better?

340
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,390
[Pure, Firm, Dazzling, Eternal]

341
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,060
My treat next time!

343
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,370
[His beloved woman will be proposed?]

344
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,760
[It's the chance.]

345
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
You're here.

346
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,520
Your milk tea.

347
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,640
What is this?

348
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,290
It's from the milk tea shop.

349
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,490
I won it with a lucky draw.

350
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,000
For you.

351
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,320
For me?

352
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,370
It's so ugly.

353
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,520
I don't want it.

354
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,040
How is it ugly?

355
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,320
Look at the resemblance.

356
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,310
I even thought of its name.

357
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,920
I'll call it Wudi Bear.

358
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,680
If you're home alone

359
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,800
with no one to play with,

360
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,130
you can have a chat with it.

361
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,450
Chat with it?

362
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,490
Impossible.

363
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,300
No man would

364
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,610
chat with a stuffed toy.

365
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,000
Why not?

366
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,330
Then...

367
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,120
Wudi Bear,

368
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,330
am I the most handsome man

369
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,250
in the whole world?

370
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,130
And the bear will say,

371
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,720
"No."

372
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,800
Is Nan Xing the most beautiful woman

373
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,859
in the whole world?

374
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,560
Then the bear will say,

375
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,490
"Yes, of course!"

376
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,369
"You are!"

377
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,119
No.

378
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,050
Stop shaking it.

379
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,579
It's getting a concussion.

380
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,619
You'll shake its neural fluid out.

381
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,319
[No way.]

382
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,960
[This little dummy can't distract me.]

383
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,650
This whole evening,

384
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,600
you brought me out

385
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,330
and bought presents for me.

386
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,160
What do you have

387
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,680
up your sleeves?

388
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,290
Nothing.

389
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,100
Everything worked out all thanks to you.

390
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,080
So I'm sincerely thanking you.

391
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,850
Thank me?

392
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,200
It's nothing.

393
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,650
Otherwise,

394
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,410
you can

395
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,000
serve me right to repay me.

396
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,330
Do you hear him, Wudi Bear?

397
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,040
Someone is asking you

398
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,490
to be his servant.

399
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,410
Come.

400
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,130
Now that you're a regular staff,

401
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,920
how does your boss treat you?

402
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,290
He's nice.

403
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,250
How nice?

404
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,200
He's...

405
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,930
Not talking about firing me anymore.

406
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,530
Not talking about firing you

407
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,740
is being nice to you?

408
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,690
You have such low standards.

409
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,960
What can I do?

410
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,050
Whenever I see him,

411
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,800
I'll get nervous

412
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,410
and couldn't speak a word.

413
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,330
If you're my boss,

414
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,730
would you

415
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,810
think that I'm a

416
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
terrible worker?

417
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
I wouldn't.

418
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,770
Really?

419
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,450
You're not worthy enough

420
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,960
to join Hehuan Palace.

421
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,880
How could I become your boss?

422
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,210
Fine, how about this?

423
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,200
You can count on me

424
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,530
about Lu Zichen.

425
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,690
You want to help me?

426
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,120
Otherwise someday,

427
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,170
you might summon me

428
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,430
in front of him one day.

429
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,290
I don't want to see this day.

430
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
What you say makes sense.

431
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,340
You're not lying to me, right?

432
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,500
Why should I lie to you?

433
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,400
For your money or your body?

434
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,370
Which one do you possess?

435
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I might possess some from each of them.

436
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,810
Xiao Wudi.

437
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,410
This job is really

438
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,490
important to me.

439
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,530
You must never

440
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
scheme anything from it.

441
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,460
Do you have other options?

442
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,120
Trust me or leave me.

443
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,200
But you mustn't lie to me!

444
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,650
Mum.

445
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,930
Milk tea in the middle of the night?

446
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,670
It's so unhealthy!

447
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,560
Do you know

448
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,970
it contains a lot of sugar and additives?

449
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,200
You'll become old and ugly!

450
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,090
Alright, I know.

451
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,970
I'll stop drinking it.

452
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,900
I won't drink it.

453
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,140
Nothing beats my cup of fresh milk.

454
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,410
So how is it, regular staff?

455
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,880
Did you see your boss?

456
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,290
I saw him.

457
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,480
But he didn't look at me too much.

458
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,440
There are so many people in your company.

459
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,050
He can't stare at each of you.

460
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,620
How would he have the time?

461
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,720
Just be yourself.

462
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,290
Trust yourself.

463
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,080
Our Nan Xing is the best!

464
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Go get busy, I'm going to bed.

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,040
Okay! Goodnight, Mum.

466
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,700
Goodnight.

467
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,530
He's good at playing trampoline.

468
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,970
My eyes are not that small.

469
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,170
Which part of you looks like me?

470
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,210
You're so ugly.

471
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,520
[I must think of a way]

472
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,360
[to make her attract Lu Zichen.]

473
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,600
We'll start from her wardrobe.

474
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,730
Who is it?

475
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,450
Okay, I'm coming!

476
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,810
So annoying!

477
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,360
It's still early.

478
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,120
Why did you wake me up?

479
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,800
This is for you. Try it on.

480
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,360
For me?

481
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,340
Why did you buy me clothes?

482
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,450
I have a question.

483
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Normally,

484
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,490
when you see Lu Zichen,

485
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,690
do you sometimes feel

486
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,640
a bit nervous?

487
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,890
That is because of your

488
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,480
difference in social status.

489
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,140
Your aura clashes each other.

490
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,640
I bought these for you

491
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,160
to give you an upgrade

492
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,890
and boost your confidence.

493
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,410
These are so not my style.

494
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,090
It's not suitable for me.

495
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,480
How do you call this

496
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,170
an upgrade if they suit you?

497
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,490
Listen to me.

498
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,520
These clothes

499
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,450
are all yours.

500
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,930
Starting tomorrow,

501
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,160
you'll wear them to work.

502
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,800
Be happy everyday.

503
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,410
Go on then.

504
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,890
These look weird on me.

505
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,490
It's really not my style.

506
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
How could they look weird?

507
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Look at yourself.

508
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
Wear it.

509
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,930
You look gorgeous!

510
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
So temperamental and charming!

511
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,080
Are you

512
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,240
just judging

513
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,000
my fashion sense?

514
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm not judging your fashion sense.

515
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,160
I do think these clothes

516
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,850
look nice.

517
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,530
But I never tried...

518
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,040
I say.

519
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,370
Didn't you ask me to help you?

520
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,530
Yes.

521
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,130
Didn't you say that this job

522
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,720
means a lot to you?

523
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,650
Of course.

524
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
So you must listen to me.

525
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,010
I'm telling you.

526
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,000
One

527
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,440
judges another person

528
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,560
based on their attire

529
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,080
for almost 70 percent.

530
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,720
So,

531
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
if you want to get

532
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,560
Lu Zichen's attention,

533
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,210
you must be bold to try

534
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,920
and be bold to change.

535
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,070
Think about it.

536
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,090
Have you ever thought about

537
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
becoming his assistant?

538
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,490
Look at you.

539
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,170
You did it.

540
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,130
You must trust yourself.

541
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,480
Wearing these clothes

542
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,610
is the right choice.

543
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,690
He'll have a different perspective of you.

544
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,280
But I still think that I'll be nervous

545
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,080
when I see him.

546
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,930
I'll still stammer.

547
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,130
Didn't you say that

548
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,520
you had a normal engagement

549
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,610
with him before?

550
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,890
That was not totally normal as well.

551
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,530
His life was threatened

552
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,520
back then.

553
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
Something got into me

554
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,270
and we had an argument.

555
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,340
What were you thinking about?

556
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,890
I didn't think much.

557
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I just thought that

558
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,170
he is unreasonable

559
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,490
like a child.

560
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,650
Yes, just like a child.

561
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,240
I know.

562
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
Perhaps in your mind,

563
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,490
you think that he's an idol.

564
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,480
He's a genius.

565
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,320
He's capable of anything.

566
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,160
But I've now discovered that

567
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,680
Lu Zichen

568
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,920
is also

569
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,930
very childish.

570
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
I was just spitballing.

571
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,810
Who knew she'd take it seriously?

572
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,690
You're her boss!

573
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,570
Of course she has to
take your words seriously.

574
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,830
He has plenty of flaws.

575
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,920
He is also incapable

576
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,930
of handling some matters

577
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,080
that require your help.

578
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,000
It's just like taking care

579
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,040
of a newborn baby.

580
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,560
Besides,

581
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,290
I, Xiao Wudi,

582
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,940
is sincerely trying

583
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,160
to help you out.

584
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,120
I was thinking of

585
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,380
gifting these to you

586
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,290
as your present for
becoming a regular staff.

587
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,090
Now that you're rejecting me,

588
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,280
what should I do?

589
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,090
Fine.

590
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,770
I'll try them on.

591
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,650
That's it.

592
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,010
Trust yourself and
everything will be alright.

593
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,480
Go on.

594
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,650
Thank you.

595
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,640
Sometimes,

596
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,300
you don't seem to be bad.

597
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,490
Why do you thank me for?

598
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,240
Perform well in front of

599
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,010
Lu Zichen.

600
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,640
Trust yourself and trust me!

601
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,200
[Done!]

602
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,920
[I'll be able to return to]

Who is that? So early.

605
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,780
I don't know.

606
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,370
Thank you.

607
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,410
Good morning.

608
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,640
Good morning, Nan Xing.

609
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,440
Good morning.

610
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Good morning.

611
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,560
Nan Xing, you...

612
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,010
I wanted to change my style.

613
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,370
She's a regular staff now.

614
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,170
That's right.

615
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,360
Not bad. Good luck!

616
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,530
You look good.

617
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,610

Good morning.

Can we talk?

640
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,420
Are you in a rush?

641
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,970
I have some work to do.

642
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,520
I...

643
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,200
Miss Jiao!

Did I

645
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,050
greet Mr. Lu just now?

646
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,850
Yes, and you didn't hiccup.

647
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,620
Although it's a normal act

648
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,680
for newcomers

649
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,870
on their first day,

650
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,930
but you finally did it.

651
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,250
Well done, Nan Xing.

652
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,540
Let's go to work.

653
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,250
Goodness! Look!

654
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,370
These fans are nuts!

655
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,940
How can they be so cruel?

656
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,330
These bunches too!

657
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,060
Look at what they have written!

658
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,850
We would receive thousands

659
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,640
of complaint letters everyday.

660
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,250
My brain is exploding!

661
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,280

can he contain himself?

676
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,400
It's no use.

677

I'll be going now.

704
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,570
Do you think Mr. Lu will revive Su Yu

705
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,650
for the readers

706
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
if he reads these?

707
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,800
Impossible.

708
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,880
Did Mr. Lu revive anyone

709
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,140
in his previous works?

710
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,370
None.

711
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,250
Su Yu's death

712
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,320
in the plot is meant

713
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,090
for the male lead

714
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,280
to face his past.

715
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,210
This motive has been achieved.

716
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,730
The readers online

717
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,930
are really agitated.

718
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,410
But we

719
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
shouldn't be like them.

720
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,890
We must not be affected.

721
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,170
Besides, the book

722
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,320
didn't mention clearly

723
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,850
that Su Yu is actually dead.

724
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,800
It's possible

725
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,610
that this is just Mr. Lu's

726
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,560
way of writing.

727
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,400
Su Yu might not be dead.

728
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,490
As a ten-year reader,

729
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,040
I believe in Mr. Lu.

730
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,920
Everything will be fine

731
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,320
if the readers are as calm

732
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,120
as you.

733
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,850
Mr. Lu.

734
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,130
Come here.

735
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,850
Regarding what you just said,

736
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
did you think it yourself

737
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,360
or did you hear it from someone else?

738
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,090
I have the pen in my hand.

739
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,650
I can write whatever I want.

740
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,580
All plots will always have a twist.

741
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,280
Mr. Lu,

742
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,850
that's not what I meant.

743
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,630
I just wanted to tell everyone

744
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,760
that you won't kill

745
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,420
a character for no reason.

746
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
But you were not explaining.

747
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,800
So I had to...

748
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

749
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,520
It's fine.

750
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,570
Your outfit today...

751
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,150
Never mind.

752
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Go and tell Miss Ye

753
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,160
I've read this.

754
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,020
She can sign it.

755
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,360
Did you

756
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,440
assign me to work?

757
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,410
Why not?

758
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
Thank you, Mr. Lu!

759
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,770
Why do you thank me?

760
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,340
This is my first task

761
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,400
from you, Mr. Lu.

762
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,610
I was just

763
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,650
an athlete

764
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,240
without any working experience.

765
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,840
However,

766
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,080
if you assign work for me,

767
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,610
I'm willing to do anything.

768
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,480
Really?

769
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,810
Of course.

770
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,210
Then go and see Miss Ye for me

771
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,320
and let me know

772
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,990
if she's in a good mood.

773
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,030
Roger that!

774
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,450
Miss Ye!

775
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,260
Come in.

776
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,050
Are you alright?

777
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:57,930
I'm fine.

778
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm not used to wearing

779
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,180
clothes like this.

780
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,640
You don't look

781
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,530
like yourself

782
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,770
wearing these.

783
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
But there might be

784
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,330
some days at work

785
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,480
that require you

786
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
to wear like this.

787
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,090
It's fine. Look at me.

788
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,679
I'm not used to it

789
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,210
after all this time.

790
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,510
Take it slowly.

791
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,449
Okay. Thanks, Miss Ye.

792
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,350
What's the matter?

793
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,010
Mr. Lu said he read it.

794
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,070
You can sign it now.

795
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,489
Why smile so sheepishly?

796
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,250
Mr. Lu arranged tasks for me!

797
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,730
How about this?

798
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Give these to your boss.

799
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,489
Ask him to go through them

800
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,150
and arrange

801
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,040
a time for a meeting.

802
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,520
Okay?

803
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,850
Okay! No problem!

804
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:43,420
Go ahead.

805
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,200
Mr. Lu!

806
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,420
Miss Ye asked me

807
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,590
to give them to you.

808
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,960
She's working?

809
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,160
I almost fell when I went into her office.

810
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,220
I didn't notice it.

811
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
Didn't notice it?

812
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,280
How is she?

813
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,570
She's in a good mood.

814
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,470
She's smiling.

815
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,480
She's smiling?

816
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,320
Is she wearing

817
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,440
any jewellery on her?

818
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,680
Jewellery?

819
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,930
Like on

820
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,600
her left hand?

821
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,440
Left hand?

822
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,920
A ring?

823
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,600
I don't think so.

824
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,440
You don't think so?

825
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,600
Or yes?

826
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,120
Yes?

827
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,290
I don't think so.

828
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,800
No.

829
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,040
Okay, go on then.

830
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,570
So he didn't give it to her.

831
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,920
But I'm sure of this.

832
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,520
Mr. Lu.

833
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,650
She has a jewellery box on her desk.

834
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,120
So he gave it to her.

835
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,560
I've been spending time with Ye Qing.

836
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,080
I think

837
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,340
she's the one for me.

838
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,090
So I want to propose to her
as soon as possible.

839
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,250
Stop rushing me.

840
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,840
I'm on my way now.

841
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,770
That's it, goodbye.

842
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,370
Miss Jiao!

843
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,180
Here is the details

844
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,170
for the New Star Program.

845
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,650
I have sorted everything in order.

846
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,650
Miss Ye mentioned about

847
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,970
an additional meeting today.

848
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,570
So I've included it

849
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,300
into Mr. Lu's schedule as well.

850
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Did I miss anything?

851
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,780
I can make further changes.

852
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,870
As expected from the first

853
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,090
permanent President's assistant

854
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,080
in our office.

855
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,010
With such heavy workload,

856
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,800
and this is your first

857
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,170
official task at work,

858
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,410
but you have completed it

859
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,320
in a day's time.

860
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Are you saying that I'm fast?

861
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,570
It's average.

862
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,260
But this is your first time

863
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,760
handling such official tasks.

864
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
You did great.

865
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,530
Work hard, Little Nan Xing!

866
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,970
Okay! Thanks, Miss Jiao!

867
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,000
Get busy then.

868
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,090
I have an appointment to attend.

869
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,680
Bye!

870
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,610
Go home early!

871
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,740
Goodbye, Miss Jiao!

872
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,120
Hello?

873
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,890
[How are you today?]

874
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,970
[Any progress?]

875
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,050
[I'm fine today.]

876
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,640
[He arranged work for me.]

877
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,210
[I've spoken to him normally too.]

878
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,200
That's nice.

879
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,420
Congratulations.

880
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,210
[What are you doing now?]

881
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,360
I'm clocking out now.

882
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,330
I'll be back soon

883
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,720
Is he off from work?

884
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,360
I think he's still in

885
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,200
his office.

886
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,160
I say,

887
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,930
how can an assistant clock off

888
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,450
before her superior?

889
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,600
You must stay.

890
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,840
Stay?

891
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,120
Why should I stay?

892
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,170
He didn't arrange any work for me.

893
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,830
I don't know

894
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,850
what I should do.

895
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,960
Did he

896
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,290
arrange work for you for the first time?

897
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,960
Did he speak to you?

898
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,890
Yes.

899
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,770
[That means it's working.]

900
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,160
He sees you.

901
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,930
You must grasp the chance.

902
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,080
Besides, assistants are supposed

903
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,330
to standby for orders.

904
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,330
You must accompany him at all times.

905
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,600
Makes sense.

906
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,860
I should stay

907
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,250
and learn more about work.

908
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,400
Tell my mother that

909
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,210
I'm not going back for dinner.

910
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,160
No problem.

911
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,000
Bye.

912
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,840
[Bye.]

913
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,660
This is a chance!

914
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,860
Miss Ye.

915
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,140
You're still here?

916
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,760
I saw Mr. Lu is still here.

917
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,640
So I plan to stay for a while

918
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,010
and learn the ropes.

919
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,170
Hello, Jiaming.

920
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,650
Reserved on my name, 7pm.

921
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,750
I'll be there soon.

922
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,680
Alright, no problem.

923
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,680
Xiao Wudi?

924
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,620
Why are you here?

925
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,560
I was eating out nearby.

926
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,640
So I came over.

927
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,450
Your boss is still working?

928
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,130
Well done.

929
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
Stay with him like this.

930
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,450
Show him your attitude.

931
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,520
What?

932
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,020
Here's your reward.

933
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Dinner.

934
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,530
Thank you.

935
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,960
And this.

936
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,000
Wine?

937
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,240
Bring it back home for me.

938
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,010
I'm going to play the trampoline.

939
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,210
It's not safe with me.

940
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,360
Okay.

941
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,190
I'll get going now.

942
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,900
[X-Culture]

943
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,240
Mr. Lu.

944
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,990
Why are you still here?

945
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,210
I was thinking

946
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,650
that you might need help.

947
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,890
You don't have to do this.

948
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,560
Go home.

949
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,160
Wait.

950
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,760
I'll escort you.

951
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,930
I'm not drunk.

952
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,160
I know.

953
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,210
Steady!

954
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,800
Stand properly, Mr. Lu.

955
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,860
I'll stop the lift.

956
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,450
The door is not open.

957
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,810
Let's go.

958
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,080
Slowly and steady.

959
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
I'll call

960
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,600
a cab for you.

961
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,440
It's fine.

962
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,280
No signal.

963
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,640
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

964
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,120
Mr. Lu!

965
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,330
Do you want to...

966
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,930
[What's happening?]

967
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,260
[Why did the lift stop?]

968
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,400
Let me see.

969
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,530
Hello? Is anybody there?

970
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,210
We're stuck in here.

971
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,000
Can someone help us?

972
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,360
Hello? Is anybody there?

973
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,200
Hello?

974
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,760
Hello? Can someone come

975
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,850
and save us?

976
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,840
Mr. Lu.

977
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,920
I guess we'll have to

978
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,280
stay here for a while.
