Why am I rolled up like this again?

[It's not good to kick
the blanket while you sleep]

6
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,380
It's not good to kick
the blanket while you sleep?

7
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,790
How did I end up sleeping like this?

8
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,970
It was him that time too?

9
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,780
Xiao Wudi.

10
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,270
The door is not shut.

11
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,100
Come in.

12
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,140
Both of you...

13
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,660
President Lu

14
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,620
said he was dizzy early in the morning.

15
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,700
What else can I do?

16
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,120
The pillow was too low.

17
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,780
I had insomnia last night.

18
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,579
If I can't sleep,

19
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,440
I will easily have Hypoglycemia.

20
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,620
Then I coincidentally saw it.

21
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,970
How unfortunate.

22
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,140
You've made all of these?

23
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,420
You deserve it.

24
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,220
This weekend,

25
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
I would like to visit father
up the mountain.

26
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,960
Would you like to come with me?

27
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,800
Tomb sweeping?

28
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,740
Sure.

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,160
Let's go together.

30
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,280
Let's go together.

31
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,220
Both of you

32
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,710
have always been like this?

33
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,680
What's the matter?

34
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,300
Nothing.

35
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,180
Nowadays, there are still authors

36
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,490
who are willing to blend into it

37
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,530
just for the role.

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,190
That's pretty good.

39
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,300
Doesn't he know

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,420
about us both?

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,220
What were you saying?

42
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,660
We...

43
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,220
Nan Xing, my girlfriend.

44
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,580
Yes.

45
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,780
Mr. Lu, please quickly eat up.

46
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,840
We'll need to head to the office soon.

47
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,520
Come on.

48
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,779
By far, the relevant book information

49
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,380
of all the pieces

50
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,459
from the New Star Program

51
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,589
has been sorted out.

52
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,500
Author interview

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,060
will be available together with

54
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,990
the online sale.

55
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,810
They are all newcomers

56
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,420
and they don't have
much influence to the market.

57
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,820
So during the publicity,

58
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,800
everyone must be more attentive.

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,940
We have arranged

60
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,260
all sorts of publicity channels.

61
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,659
We have even

62
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,780
sent our fragments to
those publicity channels

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,100
that are hard to make appointments with.

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,430
So they could pre-read.

65
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,260
The feedback is pretty good so far.

66
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,500
When we're online,

67
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,010
word of mouth will gradually do its job.

68
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,540
Mr. Lu,

69
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,780
actually there were some platforms

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,420
which approached us in advance.

71
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,500
They wanted to get priority

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,860
for the derivative copyright

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,540
of our novels.

74
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,060
We could take this slowly.

75
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,300
We can discuss this after

76
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,900
we're online with some heat.

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,300
Alright.

78
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,340
Alright, understood.

79
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,980
We'll head on first.

80
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,400
That's all.

81
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,270
Alright.

82
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,810
I will do some writing later on.

83
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,300
If there is nothing important,

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,580
please don't disturb me.

85
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,700
I won't disturb you.

86
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,900
But you need to look at

87
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,940
these two contracts.

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,580
Remember to

89
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,240
revert to me after you finish.

90
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Who handled

91
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,980
these projects previously?

92
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,580
Why are they so complicated?

93
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
It's Miss Ye.

94
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,850
I will finish them tonight

95
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,860
and revert to you tomorrow.

96
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,460
You don't have time tonight.

97
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,659
You're meeting a producer tonight.

98
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,420
This was Miss Ye's schedule.

99
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,940
Now it's panned to you.

100
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,340
Was Miss Ye

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,180
able to complete

102
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,710
all these projects in time?

103
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,150
She always completed them in advance.

104
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,710
She always came into

105
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,659
the office with everything

106
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,790
prepared and ready.

107
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,900
She would even arrange

108
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,940
for the next plan.

109
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,590
You can just complete these two first.

110
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,680
You can continue those
previous ones tomorrow.

111
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,740
Am I

112
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,180
really immature?

113
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,580
Yes.

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,700
Hello, are you free this afternoon?

115
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,310
I'll come and find you.

116
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,020
Hello, uncle and aunt.

117
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,180
You're here, Zichen.

118
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Looking for Qing?

119
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,740
Qing.

120
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,540
Give me a moment.

121
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,500
It's alright, leave it to me.

122
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,020
Dad, mum,

123
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,550
I will go out for a while.

124
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,580
Sure, go ahead.

125
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,260
Thank you.

126
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,980
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,060
I promised that I will skate with you

128
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,420
for your birthday every year.

129
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,350
It ends up being dragged until now.

130
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,500
It's not too late to go now.

131
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,909
Aren't you supposed to

132
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,320
meet a producer tonight?

133
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,240
Can you make it if you don't go now?

134
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,840
You have a good memory.

135
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,290
How long did you take for the previous

136
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,890
contract handover marking?

137
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,900
One night.

138
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,180
One night?

139
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,540
You're impressive.

140
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,820
Why?

141
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,260
Today,

142
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,550
you're presenting a
commendation conference to me?

143
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,440
More or less.

144
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,030
Didn't you

145
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,250
ask about my father?

146
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,740
Actually, I've thought it through.

147
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,560
I think it's time for me

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,020
to really be independent.

149
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,450
Back then, I was losing
my temper against you.

150
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,180
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,380
Where do you stay now then?

152
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,419
A place next to Nan Xing's house,

153
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,820
together with Xiao Wudi.

154
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,299
How can it be?

155
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,980
I can help you find another.

156
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,580
No need to.

157
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,539
I'm not here

158
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,940
to seek help today.

159
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,480
These few days, I actually thought a lot.

160
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,660
I think you were right.

161
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,850
There are many things
that I haven't thought about.

162
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,300
I haven't been noticing

163
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,340
all those years of your hard work.

164
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,900
After I actually take over

165
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,580
your jobs,

166
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,750
only I found out that

167
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,580
each time I was being capricious

168
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,510
only complicated things further.

169
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,000
I used to think that

170
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,260
expressing my mind

171
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,180
could bring things further

172
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,060
between us.

173
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,100
But unexpectedly,

174
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,980
the more capricious I am,

175
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,440
the more pressure I assert on you.

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,030
So here I am today

177
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,990
to tell you that

178
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,840
I won't talk to you

179
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,380
about the company anymore.

180
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,410
Also, don't feel

181
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,540
responsible for me.

182
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,740
I never meant to

183
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,660
blame you.

184
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,210
You're supposed to blame me.

185
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,340
And you should spend more time

186
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,390
on yourself,

187
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,340
to do things

188
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,470
that you truly like.

189
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,330
Do you have more time?

190
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,930
Let's skate two more rounds.

191
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,270
Are you okay?

192
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,340
Yes.

193
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,310
You can squat a little more.

194
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:55,940
Okay.

195
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,510
Yes.

196
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,430
Are you okay?

197
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,460
Yes.

198
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,320
No problem.

199
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
I'll let go of you.

200
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,820
Okay.

201
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,560
You can take bigger steps.

202
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,380
Like this?

203
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,220
Yes.

204
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,180
Seems to be smoother now.

205
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,550
Yes, it's smoother now.

206
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,520
We're here.

207
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,540
Xiong, don't be so serious.

208
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,060
Look at you, you dress

209
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,370
so solemnly.

210
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,030
Isn't tomb sweeping

211
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,900
a solemn thing?

212
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,860
It's been so many years.

213
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,520
If Nan Xing and I were still

214
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,900
as serious as you,

215
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,420
these two right here would

216
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,680
be anxious and find us.

217
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,820
Father.

218
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,740
Mao Xiaojun.

219
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,380
We're here to see you.

220
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,290
I brought you

221
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,220
your favourite dessert.

222
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,690
Father.

223
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,030
Mao Xiaojun.

224
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,380
Let me introduce you.

225
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,860
This is my boyfriend.

226
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,540
I see, it's to meet the parents.

227
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,380
Why did you say it
in front of your mother?

228
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,450
Otherwise, what do you think

229
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,050
I brought you here today for?

230
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,420
Hello, uncle.

231
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,500
Father.

232
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,190
Mao Xiaojun.

233
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,760
I want to tell you guys something.

234
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,700
The novel I wrote

235
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,930
is shortlisted in the New Star Program

236
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,020
from our company.

237
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,660
It was written together with my boyfriend.

238
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Am I impressive?

239
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,740
Of course you are.

240
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,860
Xiaojun,

241
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,980
you were also

242
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,860
writing and drawing everyday.

243
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,900
But there weren't
much pieces that you made.

244
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Nan Xing is more excellent than you.

245
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,860
Here, Aunt An.

246
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,420
How about it?

247
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,980
I told you.

248
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,220
Someone has better taste than you.

249
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,260
I knew there was something
going on with you two.

250
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,220
You never told me.

251
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,500
I just wanted to tell in front of

252
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,660
you guys together.

253
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,510
[Mao Xiaojun's grave]

254
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,940
I heard that you dislike orange too.

255
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,030
Let's make friends.

256
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,370
[Mao Xiaojun's grave]

257
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,180
Let me help you, Aunt An.

258
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,780
It's fine.

259
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,780
Xiong,

260
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,860
any plan for both of you

261
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,220
in the future?

262
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,940
I haven't thought about it.

263
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,320
Haven't thought about it?

264
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,060
Mother.

265
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,740
Why so long?

266
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,860
Toilet is a little far away.

267
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,460
Let's go.

268
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,860
All the bowls are here, mum.

269
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,190
Okay, put them here.

270
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,660
What's wrong?

271
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,830
It's considered public now

272
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,520
between you and Xiong, right?

273
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,340
Xiong has good character.

274
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,980
He's also smart.

275
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,220
Most importantly, you like him

276
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,860
I was supposed to

277
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,260
feel quite happy

278
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,940
about this.

279
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,700
You were supposed to?

280
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,220
You're not happy now?

281
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,010
Not unhappy.

282
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,740
I asked him today whether

283
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,420
he has any plan

284
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,980
for the future of both of you.

285
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,310
He said he doesn't know.

286
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,980
He hasn't thought about it.

287
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,420
You really did ask that?

288
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Why? Can't I ask?

289
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,660
Please avoid such question

290
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,590
to him next time.

291
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,180
Why can't I ask?

292
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,900
I want to ask you as well.

293
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,460
What are your plans for the future

294
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,540
of both of you?

295
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,700
There's something

296
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,420
I shouldn't tell you about.

297
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,420
Anyway,

298
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,300
no matter what happens
between us in the future,

299
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,580
I just wish that I can be

300
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,020
together with him now.

301
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,660
Are you hiding something

302
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,370
from me?

303
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,780
What is it that you can't tell me?

304
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,060
Please don't ask.

305
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,340
You wouldn't believe me

306
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,500
even if I told you.

307
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,020
How would you know

308
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,420
I wouldn't believe it
if you didn't tell me?

309
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,860
Alright then.

310
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,620
Don't say it.

311
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,420
I'm not your biological mother anyway.

312
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,500
What are you talking about?

313
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,460
You are my biological mother.

314
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,920
Why won't you tell me then?

315
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
I'm only worried about you.

316
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,140
It's your first love.

317
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,700
I asked Xiong today

318
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,940
and he said he hasn't thought about it.

319
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,660
I asked you and you're hesitant

320
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,620
without telling anything.

321
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,860
I don't want you both

322
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,660
being confused together.

323
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,220
Don't force yourself.

324
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,300
It's fine.

325
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,000
[Nan Xing is here.]

326
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,900
[Aunt An.]

327

[Xiaojun.]

[Nan Xing came to do homework with you.]

331
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,570
[Go in.]

332
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,110
[I'll go in now.]

333

Mao Xiaojun.

334
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,380
Mao Xiaojun.

335
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,810
Why are you messing around again?

336
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,420
When am I messing around?

337
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,810
Can I copy your math homework?

338
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,580
Do it yourself.

339
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,700
I don't know how.

340
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,740
Look, I can't even do this.

341
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,860
Could you teach me then?

342
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,620
No.

343
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,620
Can't you think yourself?

344
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,100
I've tried.

345
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,420
I really don't know how.

346
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,000
Please get out.

347
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,220
Please take your math homework

348
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,740
and use your little brain.

349
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,220
Okay?

350
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,140
Think about it.

351
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,339
You sure can do it.

352
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,150
-Go ahead, keep it up.
-You'd teach me in the past.

353
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,980
[How would I dream of Mao Xiaojun?]

354
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,900
[He liked Nan Xing?]

355
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,620
[What does it mean?]

356
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,270
[Does it want me
to tell Nan Xing about it?]

357
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,140
What are you doing?

358
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,210
I'm thinking of a plot.

359
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,100
Let me ask you something.

360
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm really thinking of a plot.

361
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,260
I'll help you think
about it together later.

362
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,060
Please help me solve this first.

363
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,260
Tell me.

364
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,100
Are you still into Ye Qing?

365
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,260
I got it.

366
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,620
Suppose that

367
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,280
you're still into Ye Qing.

368
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,460
Both of you are

369
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,740
together right now.

370
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,660
You suddenly...

371
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,020
Why are we together?

372
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,060
Is that important?

373
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,980
Of course.

374
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,030
You said suppose that.

375
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,510
It needs logic then.

376
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,850
You can make it up first.

377
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,890
You both are together now.

378
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,350
Hold on.

379
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,100
What is it again?

380
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,670
I just made it up.

381
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,380
You're into Ye Qing.

382
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,420
And now you guys

383
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
are together.

384
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,100
Suddenly, you find out

385
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,180
the one Ye Qing had a crush on
when she was little

386
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,440
also had a crush on her.

387
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,260
Would you tell her about it?

388
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,260
Of course I would.

389
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,580
If you told her,

390
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,020
you would disappear from

391
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,620
this world.

392
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,020
Would you still tell her?

393
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,820
Yes.

394
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,900
Why?

395
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
Because if she found out eventually

396
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,270
that I didn't tell her about it,

397
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,390
she would still make me disappear.

398
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,740
I knew that you couldn't help.

399
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,620
Hold on.

400
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,300
Didn't you say

401
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,700
that we're going to
discuss about the plot?

402
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
What plot?

403
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,460
Secret room murder cases.

404
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,930
The murder weapon is a knife.

405
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,700
Must it be a knife?

406
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,700
It must be a knife.

407
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,120
I don't know about it then.

408
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,500
I have never used a knife before.

409
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,060
I only use poison.

410
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,900
I couldn't help you.

411
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,980
Find your own way.

412
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,340
Poison?

413
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,940
Sounds good too.

414
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,210
Thank you.

415
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,660
[Is this my mission?]

416
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,020
[If I told Nan Xing about it,]

417
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,140
[would I disappear again?]

418
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,660
[It was only a dream.]

419
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,160
[Don't overthink it.]

420
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,030
Nan Xing, are you done packing?

421
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,040
We're leaving.

422
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,260
[I'm still changing.]

423
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,060
[Mum, you can go first.]

424
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,180
Okay.

425
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,180
Think about what

426
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,060
I told you last night.

427
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,880
Good morning, Aunt An.

428
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,340
Good morning.

429
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Did you forget the key?

430
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,550
Breakfast.

431
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,060
What do you plan to do today?

432
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,230
I haven't thought about it.

433
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,340
Nan Xing.

434
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,140
When we were at

435
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,780
the grave yesterday, Aunt An

436
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,980
asked me

437
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,410
if I have a plan for both of us

438
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,420
in the future.

439
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,420
I didn't answer.

440
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,700
I think she seems

441
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,300
disappointed in me.

442
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,980
I'm only worried about you.

443
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,740
It's your first love.

444
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,260
I asked Xiong today

445
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,540
and he said he hasn't thought about it.

446
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,980
I ask you now and you're hesitant

447
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,140
without telling anything.

448
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,270
I don't want you both

449
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,220
being confused together.

450
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,740
What can be done?

451
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,620
If she knew about

452
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,620
the truth,

453
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,030
she would understand.

454
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,340
That's not wrong.

455
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,420
How great it would be

456
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,020
if I were born and raised

457
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
in this world.

458
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,980
What if you were?

459
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,980
Then I'll

460
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,940
be your first love.

461
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,420
How immature.

462
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,020
I am, what about it?

463
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,380
Although

464
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,990
I'm not your first love,

465
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,340
I am however your first kiss.

466
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,780
What's so good about first kiss?

467
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,490
Not only do I want your first kiss,

468
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,740
but I also want your first...

469
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,660
First what?

470
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,620
I'm warning you.

471
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,860
Don't flirt me.

472
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,540
How is the first marriage
considered as flirting?

473
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,470
First marriage?

474
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,340
Your first marriage.

475
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,900
You want to marry me?

476
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,180
I couldn't be your first love.

477
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,380
But I could be

478
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,900
your first marriage.

479
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,260
Let's eat.

480
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,780
Xingxing.

481
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,380
Whose birthday is it today?

482
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,980
We have something very important today.

483
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,860
It's worth celebrating.

484
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,260
Isn't it the launching
of New Star Program?

485
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,740
Not only that.

486
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
The reader's feedback
is exceptionally good.

487
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,540
We can conclude that

488
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,900
it has the highest clicks

489
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,540
among the New Star Program.

490
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,210
Really?

491
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,700
Miss Nan,

492
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,140
I'm afraid you're going to be famous.

493
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,940
Miss Nan?

494
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,220
Why does it sound

495
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,610
a little weird?

496
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,540
Miss Jiao, stop teasing me.

497
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,070
Let's go.

498
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,060
Let's gather everybody

499
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,780
for the cake cutting.

500
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,980
Let's go.

501
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,810
Nan Xing.

502
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,640
Congratulations!

503
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,780
Come on!

504
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,580
Nan Xing's the best!

505
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,580
Great! Great!

506
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,980
Congratulations Nan Xing!

507
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,380
Thank you, everyone!

508
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Bubble tea for everyone, my treat!

509
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,300
Don't drink bubble tea.

510
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,560
Let's drink, my treat.

511
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,460
Thank you, Mr. Lu!

512
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,970
Pop the champagne! Pop the champagne!

513
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,100
Cut the cake!

514
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,420
Come on, each person one piece.

515
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,620
I want too!

516
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,340
I want the pitaya flavoured!

517
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,460
I want that too!

518
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,900
Come on!

519
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,700
Thank you.

520
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,620
I want the pitaya flavoured!

521
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,020
You're so great, Nan Xing.

522
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,380
You're so great, Nan Xing.

You will surely become

Do you know

568
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,020
it's the Gold Award that you got!

569
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,860
Those publishers

570
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,740
always make things
difficult for your contract.

571
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,870
Now that we got this,

572
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,900
we won't let them

interfere you that much anymore.

574
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,780
But they

575
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,260
didn't want to sign you as well.

576
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,140
It's fine.

577

Although I like to imagine

578

581
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,530
However,

582
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,410
I am not as talented as you.

583
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,700
It's not necessary for me to be an author.

584
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,860
I could find a job

585
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,460
and accompany you write.

586
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,100
I could keep being your top reader.

587
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,580
Most importantly,

588
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,770
we will let the world

which isn't that good in wage

602
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,980
but very challenging,

603
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,400
would you like to do it?

604
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
What kind of job

605
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,100

610
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,500
within three tries,

611
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,900
you will take the job.

614

That's why I said gamble.

615

However, like you said.

643
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,260
This job

644
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,500
has not much wage

645
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,260
and it's highly challenging.

646

00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,690
I only wanted to celebrate for

695
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,470
the excellent hit rate
of our novel, didn't I?

696
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,480
I'll change my way for that next time.

697
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,780
Let's eat, I'm starving.

698
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,770
You eat.

699
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,860
Have you checked out those comments

700
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,020
of your novel yet?

701
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,980
Male lead is so sweet.

702
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,660
He's literally full of glamour.

703
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,740
Fairy,

704
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,740
please also send me

705
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,820
the same Mr. Bad from above.

706
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,860
How are these

707
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,110
netizens' comments

708
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,500
so creative?

709
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,420
They have good taste.

710
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,100
I think

711
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,420
I have a better taste.

712
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,550
Let's feast more today.

713
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:50,700
Here.

714
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,730
The prawn is pretty good.

715
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,060
Xiao Wudi.

716
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,020
Thank you.

717
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,950
If it wasn't for you,

718
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,160
I wouldn't have

719
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,900
encountered these stories.

720
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,800
I couldn't have

721
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,280
written this novel alone.

722
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,930
What's wrong?

723
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,250
Why suddenly so sensational?

724
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,180
I truly think

725
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,610
that I'm very lucky.

726
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,810
I think

727
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,660
I'm luckier.

728
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,410
I'll head to the toilet.

729
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,340
Please enjoy.

730
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,740
Miss.

731
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,420
Are you okay?

732
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:01,980
Xiao...

733
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,700
Are you okay?

734
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,580
Xiao Wudi.

735
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,500
What's wrong?

736
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,870
Are you okay?

737
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,790
Are you feeling better?

738
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,940
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,820
I scared you again.

740
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,580
Are you fool?

741
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,660
Is this even time for apology?

742
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,540
It wasn't so serious before.

743
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
How is it so sudden today?

744
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,100
Doctor said

745
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,060
that my illness

746
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,260
could turn

747
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,740
more severe.

748
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,980
But I'm usually fine.

749
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,620
Don't worry about me.

750
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,940
Was it because you thought that

751
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,900
I would leave,

752
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,700
so you...

753
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,180
No.

754
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,580
Please don't think that way.

755
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,140
It's because

756
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,380
Miss Ye left the company all of a sudden.

757
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,910
A ton of work was left behind

758
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,260
and passed to my side.

759
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,980
How could I handle alone?

760
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,990
And my mother

761
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,380
always nags at me.

762
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,580
It's very harsh for me.

763
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,340
You mentioned your mother nagging at you.

764
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,620
What was it about?

765
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,540
She asked me

766
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,700
about our future plan for both of us.

767
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,500
I couldn't explain to her

768
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,540
about who you are.

769
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,910
So I was hesitant and couldn't answer.

770
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,940
She even thought that there's

771
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,460
problem between us.

772
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,230
You don't have to worry.

773
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,620
Aunt An

774
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,900
loves you so much.

775
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,980
It is only natural that she is concerned

776
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,060
about our future.

777
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980
I will select a suitable time

778
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,620
to explain everything to her.

779
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
It'll be alright.

780
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,540
Don't overthink.

781
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,860
Got it.

782
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,280
[Nan Xing.]

783
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,080
[Don't you worry.]

784
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,940
[I will surely find a way]

785
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,620
[to cure your illness.]
