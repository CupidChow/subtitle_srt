Why are we here?

6
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,490
You still don't get it?

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,009
Get what?

The rule of summoning.

9
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,090
Now I am more confused.

10
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,410
The first time I summoned you,

11
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,380
I was in an embarrassing situation.

12
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,420
The second time,

13
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,900
I was in danger.

14
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,660
You said I needed

15
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,060
a hero who can save me.

16
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,750
But I didn't need saving

17
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,310
in either case just now.

18
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,010
Nothing happened.

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,579
I thought so at first.

20
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,579
But now I realise

21
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,470
that what really matters

22
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,120
is not the situation

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,820
you are in,

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,740
but the outcome after you summon me.

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,329
Outcome?

26
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,760
[When you first summoned me,]

27
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,980
[I saved you from embarrassment.]

28

[I saved your life.]

30
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,460
[As for the third and fourth time,]

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,780
[I wiped your mouth]

32
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,579
[and gave you]

33
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,780
a shoulder to lean on.

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,990
Do you get it now?

35
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,820
No?

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,390
When you were embarrassed,

37
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,579
I saved you from embarrassment.

38
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,500
When you were in danger, I protected you.

39

When you were tired, I took care of you.

40

Who is kidding here?

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,560
You have been deceiving me

48

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,680
And you were still deceiving me just now.

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,410
What on earth

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,480

52

What else could I wish for?

53
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,460
Well, I said

54
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,850
I wanted

55
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,240
an unforgettable love.

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,160
What?

57
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,310
I wanted

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,610
an unforgettable love.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,410
Do you need help

60
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,410
with that tongue?

61
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,090
Speak up.

62
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,060
I said I wanted

63
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,470
an unforgettable love.

64
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
But I didn't know

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,630
why things

66
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,850
turn out like this.

67
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,880
Can you not stare at me like that?

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,080
Surveillance cameras are everywhere.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So you do know you are being watched.

70
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,510
Then how dare you make that wish?

71
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,490
I was triggered at that time.

72
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,930
So I just said it without much thought.

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,050
Did you know

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,779
what would happen

75
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,180

76

I said it without much thought.

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,370
How could I have thought
of the consequences?

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Very well.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,860
Do you think someone like you

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,500
deserves an unforgettable love?

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,550
Stop dreaming.

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,530
Why don't I deserve

83
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,080
an unforgettable love?

84
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,590

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,780
who would dream?

89

what is wrong with someone like me?

91
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,190
I don't take things
that don't belong to me.

92
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,790
I got a job to support myself.

93
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,590
Other than being single all my life,

94
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,020
do I have any flaws?

95

An unforgettable love?

96
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,200
Will I have to

97
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,130
fall for

98
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,600
a girl like that?

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,640
What a wishful thinking.

100
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,020
If she ever

101
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,580
pesters me again,

102
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,100

My career has just begun.

176
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,150
♫ Is love ♫

177
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,020
But you... You don't even have a job.

178
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,950
You don't even have an identity card.

179
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,500
Without it,

180
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,760
how can we register
our marriage in the future?

181
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,400
How can we register
the birth of our children?

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,620
Stop dreaming.

183
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,230
Did I say I wanted to
have children with you?

184
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,190
You don't want to have children?

185
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,420
This is not about me.

186
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,970
Didn't you say

187
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,490
you wanted an unforgettable love?

188
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,220
But you didn't say it must be me.

189
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,740
If I can find you a guy,

190
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,890
the job will be done.

191
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,420
You make a good point.

192
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,860
If you can find me a boyfriend,

193
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,920
your mission will be accomplished.

194
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,140
I hope so too.

195
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,830
But before that happens,

196
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,410
will I still be able

197
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,460
to summon you?

198
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,770
That is why we need to work quickly.

199
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,860
My patience

200
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,040
has a limit.

201
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,350
If I lose it one day...

202
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,860
You...

203
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,230
Why are you acting like a
vengeful spirit in search of victims?

204
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,830
This is exactly what it is.

205
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,190
We need to find a guy immediately.

206
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,940
And I can hand you over

207
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,990
to him.

208
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,010
Do you think no one fancy me?

209
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,600
Who?

210
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Who has the nerve?

211
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,370
Do you think I don't know

212
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,120
you're being sarcastic?

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,850
The males in my team

214
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
scream whenever they see me.

215
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,460
My popularity

216
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,020
is not something I want to brag about.

217
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,690
Fine.

218
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,670
Show me tomorrow.

219
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,240
Fine.

220
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,800
Tomorrow,

221
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
don't forget to bring money.

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,250
I am going home.

223
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,760
It is still raining.

224
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,800
Give it to me.
That is my umbrella.

225
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,020
Why are you so slow?

226
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,220
Can you hurry up?

227
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,700
Xiao...

228
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,310
Surprise!

229
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,080
Mum?

230
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,080
Xiao...

231
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,310
He is so handsome.

232
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,800
Xiong.

233
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,190
Xiong?

234
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,660
Xiong.

235
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,590
Yes.

236
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,780
Mum, he is Xiong Sisi's cousin.

237
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,750
Xiong Wudi.

238
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,280
Hello, aunt.

239
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,110
You are Sisi's cousin?

240
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,160
I thought...

241
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,170
Well, what a coincidence.

242
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,230
Today is Nan Xing's first day at work.

243
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
I purposely rushed home

244
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,250
to cook a feast.

245
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,960
Join us.

246
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,660
Alright.

247
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,050
Come in.

248
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,310
Quick, come in.

249
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,120
Go back to Unit 302.

250
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,090
My mum will ask you...

251
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,670
Come in.

252
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,470
What was that about?

253
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,130
What do you want me to say?

254
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,170
I had to

255
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,600
give you a proper identity.

256
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,270
I can't say

257
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,350
the fairy sent you

258
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,620
from the past, can I?

259
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,930
True men don't change their first

260
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,480
or last names.

261
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,570
Haven't you heard of that?

262
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,870
Yes, I know.

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,050
But what is said is said.

264
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,010
What do you want me to say now?

265
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,610
That you are Xiong Xiao Wudi?

266
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,340
Wudi Bear?

267
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,420
Wudi Bear sounds fine actually.

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,130
Are you tired of living?

269
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,730
Mum.

270
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,080
What are you two doing?

271
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,410
He...

272
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,540
Come over and eat.

273
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,930
Start without me.

274
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,530
I'm going to cut some fruits.

275
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,190
The dish...

276
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,480
Eat up.

277
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,770
Don't you think

278
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
it tastes like...

279
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,420
Help yourself.

280
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,230
Is it good?

281
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,490
Yes, aunt.

282
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,500
Here. Have some fruits
to get rid of greasiness.

283
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,050
This is

284
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,430
Nan Xing's favourite.

285
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,400
You must try it.

286
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,540
I'm going to clean up a bit.

287
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:13,880
Okay.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,130
Go ahead without me.

289
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,000
You don't want it?
What a picky eater.

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,300
I don't eat oranges.

291
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,650
They taste weird.

292
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,240
Mum,

293
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,020
you didn't

294
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,420
wash your knife after cutting the chilli?

295
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
I forgot it again.

296
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,630
I will get you some water.

297
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,080
Here. Drink some water.

298
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,550
Thanks, aunt.

299
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,260
Are you alright, Xiong?

300
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,150
I am fine.

301
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,300
How is the food?

302
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,320
They are so good.

303
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,900
Really?

304
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,080
Have some more.

305
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,630
Okay.

306
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,410
Here you go.

307
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,440
Xiong.

308
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,080
Where do

309
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,930
you live?

310
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,390
I live at the opposite unit.

311
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,760
Opposite this unit?

312
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,420
He just came to town.
He has no where to live.

313
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,180
So I rented Unit 302 to him.

314
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,000
Her dad left her that unit.

315
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,020
It has been vacant for many years.

316
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,110
We cleaned the place up

317
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,670
because we wanted to rent it out.

318
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,850
But you have moved in there?

319
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,770
Yes.

320
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,350
You're very efficient.

321
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,040
No, mum.

322
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,540
So,

323
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,690
what is your profession?

324
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,370
He...

325
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,590
I am not asking you.

326
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,960
I usually

327
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,580
help people

328
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,390
to find love.

329
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,940
I know.

330
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,170
You are a dating consultant, aren't you?

331
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,880
Right?

332
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,600
Then you should

333
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,110
be able to help Nan Xing

334
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,860
come up with a few strategies.

335
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,430
If it were up to her,

336
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,820
she would not be able to find a lover.

337
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,280
Mum.

338
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,260
Something smells like it's burnt.

339
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,520
Do you want to go and check it out?

340
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,160
Yes, I need to check it out.

341
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,420
Stop eating already.

342
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,480
Get going now.

343
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,650
Why?

344
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,670
Mum, he has to go.

345
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,010
I will see him to the door.

346
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,140
You are leaving now?

347
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,350
Join us again next time, Xiong.

348
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
Don't take my mum's words

349
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,110
seriously.

350
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,310
Well,

351
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,330
do you feel

352
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,500
dizzy?

353
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,360
Nauseous?

354
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,770
Tightness in your chest?

355
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,190
Nothing?

356
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,490
That is weird.

357
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,550
Not many people can go home
without feeling sick

358
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,280
after eating my mum's cooking.

359
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,050
If you feel sick

360
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,890
at midnight,

361
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,460
call me.

362
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,300
I will send you some medicine.

363
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,030
Cut the crap.

364
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,140
Don't forget about tomorrow.

365
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,950
Tomorrow?

366
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,090
Find a replacement.

367
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,350
Did you really forget?

368
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,750
Are we really doing this?

369
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,070
See you tomorrow.

370
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,930
I think Xiong is not bad.

371
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,860
He is good-looking

372
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,380
and very courteous.

373
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,720
How do you know

374
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,190
he is courteous?

375
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,370
You think I don't know

376
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,050
how bad my cooking is?

377
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,820
Other than that brat,

378
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,110
I have never seen anyone

379
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
enjoy my food

380
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,150
so much.

381
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,130
What can this mean?

382
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,900
It means he is well bred.

383
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,470
It can also mean

384
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,800
he has a loss of taste.

385
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,160
Anyway, I think he is nice.

386
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,490
You should give him a thought.

387
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,460
He and I will never be together.

388
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,740
Why not?

389
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,010
If nothing will happen,
why did you rent the unit to him?

390
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,890
So many people

391
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,150
came to view the unit,

392
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,200
but you turned them all down.

393
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,750
So why are you renting it to him?

394
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,520
[What can I do?]

395
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,270
[I can't]

396
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,120
[let him stay in my room, right?]

397
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,560
This is a golden opportunity.

398
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,580
Take action when you have to.

399
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,340
Mum, I'm not in the mood

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,790
to think about that now.

401
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,120
Today is your first day at work.

402
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,840
Did your boss like you?

403
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,480
He didn't go to office.

404
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,880
That is normal.

405
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,420
Bosses are very busy.

406
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,200
They won't go to the office every day.

407
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,800
Look at me.

408
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,550
I don't go to work every day too.

409
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:22,950
Right?

410
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,430
You have just started working.
So take it easy.

411
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,609
Get yourself familiar

412
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,040
with the company data,

413
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,680
the environment,

414
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,079
and your colleagues too.

415
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,619
But I didn't get to do all this.

416
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,000
Cheer up.

417
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,240
Don't forget

418
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,170
what you have learnt as an athlete.

419
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,280
Never abandon, never give up.

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,510
Alright, get some rest early.

421
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,850
Okay.

422
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,890
[For you. Just in case.]

423
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,730
[Indigestion and Stomachache]

424
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,760
I said I wanted

425
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,210
an unforgettable love.

426
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,010
[I will help her to find a lover]

427
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,960
[so that I can go back sooner.]

428
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,610
[For you. Just in case.]

429
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,360
Xiao Wudi?

430
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,310
He's not around?

431
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,110
I did call you.

432
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,380
I am leaving now.

433
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,380
Good morning.

434
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,600
You...

435
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,770
I was afraid I wouldn't wake up

436
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,490
if someone

437
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,030
called me in a low voice.

438
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,230
Actually,

439
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,470
what can you do if you come with me?

440
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,970
I want to hear

441
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,990
people screaming for you.

442
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,850
Do you have money with you?

443
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,180
Fried chicken! Snacks!

444
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,360
Thanks, Nan Xing.

445
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,970
Nan Xing, are they spicy?

446
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,170
Some are spicy.

447
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,060
Here. This bucket
has the original flavour.

448
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,860
Spicy ones are here.

449
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,000
You call this screaming?

450
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,510
Nan Xing,

451
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,720
why didn't you visit us lately?

452
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,250
I came before going to work.

453
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,410
Hey, handsome.

454
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,330
Would you like to join us
for some fried chicken?

455
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,920
Can I eat here then?

456
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,500
Sure. You definitely won't mind.

457
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,420
Nan Xing.

458
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,680
How are you doing

459
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,580
at your new job?

460
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,490
Don't be nervous.

461
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,640
I won't steal

462
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,000
my senior's boyfriend.

463
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,720
You mean me?

464
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,820
Don't misunderstand.

465
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,840
Nan Xing is pure and innocent.

466
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,380
Although she gets along well with boys,

467
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,460
they are just buddies.

468
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,340
It won't turn romantic.

469
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,200
Why so?

470
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,990
Because everyone likes

471
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,810
girls that normal people like.

472
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,480
What kind of girls

473
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,950
do normal people like?

474
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,970
Those who know
how to act like a spoiled child,

475
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,610
are feminine and gentle

476
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,420
and know how to dress up,

477
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
in every way

478
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,690
unlike Nan Xing.

479
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,750
Otherwise, she wouldn't

480
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,680
have remained single all her life.

481
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,240
Remained single all her life?

482
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,730
Change your perspective.

483
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,930
Maybe she is

484
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,410
waiting for you all along.

485
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,000
Right?

486
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,700
That is just so romantic.

487
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,220
By the way, handsome.

488
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,580
Do you know anyone

489
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,640
as handsome as you?

490
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,890
The less handsome ones are fine too.

491
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,620
I don't mind.

492
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,090
How about cousins on your father's side

493
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,350
or your mother's side?

494
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,200
Anyone like that?

495
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,990
Enjoy the food.

496
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,500
Sure.

497
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,650
Xiong Sisi.

498
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,430
I didn't do anything.

499
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,010
I was just chatting with him.

500
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
[With the way she is,]

501
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,370
[will I ever be able to
find a replacement?]

502
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,550
[Can I still leave this place?]

503
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,880
What did you chat about?

504
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,220
I wished you two happiness.

505
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,380
What?

506
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,090
He and I aren't in
that kind of relationship.

507
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,000
You don't have to hide it from me, Nan Xing.

508
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,170
He was the one who asked you
to borrow the tracksuit

509
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,970
the other day.

510
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,630
I was tailing him.

511
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,040
He is just my tenant.

512
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,630
I borrowed the tracksuit

513
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,220
for him

514
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,730
because of something that happened.

515
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,120
Stop imagining things.

516
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,340
Really?

517
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,810
I will pursue him then.

518
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,670
Come back here.

519
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,140
Are you tired of living?

520
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,630
What?

521
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,330
What are you talking about?

522
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,530
Listen.

523
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,040
From now on,

524
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,590
don't get too close to him.

525
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,770
If you run into him,

526
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
just turn around.

527
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,690
You hear me?

528
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,750
It is for your own good.

529
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,800
Fine.

530
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,890
I got it.

531
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,860
Also,

532
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,550
don't go to my place for now.

533
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,390
Don't let my mum see you.

534
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,820
Why?

535
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,330
Don't ask.

536
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,890
Eat up now.

537
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,800
The coach will be here soon.

538
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,300
Try this.

539
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,680
How about this?

540
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,900
What's wrong with you?

541
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,660
I am just wondering

542
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,130
if I can go back.

543
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,860
You must go back.

544
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,240
You must never

545
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,330
lose faith.

546
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,180
This isn't a good place.

547
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,040
We have air pollution and global warming.

548
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,970
Besides, the pace of life is too fast.

549
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,030
The past is better.

550
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,240
Alright. I get it.

551
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,590
Go to work first.

552
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,640
I will

553
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,980
figure something out.

554
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,220
Alright. I will get going now.

555
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,820
I almost forgot this.

556
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,750
Since you have moved into the unit,

557
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,980
my mum wants to buy
a new set of furniture for you.

558
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,570
Alright.

559
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,720
Xiao Wudi.

560
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,570
Go for it!

561
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,840
Never abandon, never give up.

562
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,390
Miss Jiao, good morning.

563
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,380
Nan Xing.

564
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,720
You are so early.

565
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,730
When I was

566
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,540
training,

567
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,620
I had to be even earlier.

568
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,460
I am used to it already.

569
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,470
Where did you

570
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,900
get so many flowers?

571
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,810
You seem to be quite romantic.

572
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,840
Miss Jiao, good morning.

573
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,470
Good morning.

574
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,100
Good morning.

575
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,980
I saw some flowers

576
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,310
on the table yesterday.

577
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,630
Although they weren't mine,

578
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,380
seeing them

579
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,680
made me happy.

580
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,030
So I thought I should

581
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,910
get everyone some.

582
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,460
I hope

583
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,640
I can perform well.

584
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,330
Miss Jiao, this is for you.

585
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,160
It is so pretty.

586
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
Thanks, Nan Xing.

587
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,900
Miss Jiao.

588
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,440
What can I do today?

589
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,420
Chu.

590
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,560
Didn't you say

591
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,280
you need Nan Xing's help?

592
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:20,800
I have

593
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,020
some receipts here.

594
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,550
I need them pasted on paper.

595
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,710
When you are doing it,

596
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,540
feel free to

597
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,650
ask me anytime

598
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,470
if you have any question.

599
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,630
Sure, no problem.

600
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,550
Do it well.

601
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,080
Miss Jiao.

602
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,540
Please take a look at this.

603
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Let me see.

604
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,610
Chu, this is for you.

605
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,350
Yu Fan, I will place this here.

606
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,570
I am allergic to flowers.

607
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,620
Give it to Chu.

608
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,430
Thank you.

609
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,100
This kid is quite diligent.

610
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,280
It will be a pity

611
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,770
if she is fired.

612
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,020
Based on the way our boss
treats his assistants,

613
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,220
she won't last a week.

614
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,600
What do you mean?

615
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,440
A day.

616
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,960
Boss is coming to the office today.

617
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,600
Good morning, Boss.

618
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,400
Good morning.

619
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,660
You are an athlete?

620
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,600
Never abandon, never give up.

621
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,450
So why did you give up

622
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,830
on being an athlete?

623
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,140
I...

624
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,490
Why are you still here?

625
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,180
Boss.

626
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,950
She is your new assistant.

627
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,200
Her name is Nan Xing.

628
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,970
Miss Ye has interviewed her.

629
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,540
I am doomed.

630
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,550
I froze again.

631
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,880
Boss must surely be mad.

632
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,750
Nan Xing, don't be too worried.

633
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,160
Since I think

634
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,820
this is probably the last.

635
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,810
What's with that assistant?

636
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,820
Didn't we agree about hiring an assistant?

637
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,680
I made the call.

638
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,630
She can't even say a word.

639
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,330
How can she be an assistant?

640
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,420
I hired her

641
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,410
to help you,

642
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,930
not to talk to you.

643
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,450
Besides,
that girl is gutsy and meticulous.

644
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,500
She is very persistent

645
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,920
and also a long-time fan of yours.

646
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,890
She knows you very well.

647
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,290
She should be able to
tolerate your temper.

648
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,220
You know

649
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,520
you need help,

650
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,230
but you can't keep
changing your assistant.

651
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,470
Give her some time.

652
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,580
One week.

653
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,350
After one week,

654
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
if she can't change
my impression of her...

655
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,530
I will fire her.

656
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,940
Take my breakfast.

657
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,370
I didn't know you were coming today.

658
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,090
So I didn't get

659
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,290
your favourite milk.

660
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,070
Your boyfriend I met last time,

661
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,160
what is his name again?

662
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
Song Jiaming.

663
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,760
So when

664
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,350
did you guys start dating?

665
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,410
Recently.

666
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,760
How did you know him?

667
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,570
While playing golf.

668
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,990
We are going to play golf this weekend.

669
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,650
You want to join us?

670
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,530
I don't like to play golf.

671
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:43,950
Right.

672
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,400
Do you really need a boyfriend?

673
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,120
Mr. Lu.

674
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,800
I am a human.

675
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,350
I need to live my life.

676
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,360
I am not

677
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,930
a working machine
that the company bought.

678
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,560
I...

679
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,050
That is not what I meant.

680
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,950
The contract is ready.

681
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,210
You can sign it now.

682
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,400
[Ye]

683
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,210
Thanks.

684
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,170
You like it?

685
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,260
Here you go.

686
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,260
The necklace looks nice.

687
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,170
It is a birthday gift.

688
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,240
Mr. Lu.

689
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,640
Have you signed it?

690
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,370
I need to get changed.

691
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,260
[Nan Xing.]

692
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,890
[You must have left him]

693
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,290
[with a bad impression.]

694
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,530
[What should I do to redeem myself?]

695
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,500
Hello, Boss.

696
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,700
[What should I do?]

697
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,730

to talk to him.]

[Don't be nervous.]

00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,580
[Do it as you normally would.]

703
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,050
Are you alright?

704
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,890
[Nan Xing, what are you doing?]

705
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,150
[Are you insane?]

706
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,340
[You should have just kept quiet
if you are doing this.]

707
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,230
I will be writing at home this week.

708
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,380
If you have nothing to do,

709
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,220
you can either stay here

710
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,100
or go home.

[No. I won't be able to
hold the job this way.]

Don't act like a stranger.

713
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,090
I can accompany you at your home.

714
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,500
I can manage it myself.

715
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,700
[Dear God.]

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,050
[Just kill me.]

717

[No.]

[do normal people like?]

722
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,250
Those who know
how to act like a spoiled child,

723
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,560
are feminine and gentle

724
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,240
and know how to dress up,

725
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,580
in every way

726
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,720
unlike Nan Xing.

727
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,960
She is obviously not that kind of girls.

728
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,500
What should I do?

729
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,780
You have parcels.

730
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,460
Where do you want me to put them?

731
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,000
Here.

732
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,840
Okay.

733
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,610
Replace the old television

734
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,540
with the new one.

735
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,750
And change the curtains

736
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,010
in the living room too.

737
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,310

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,680
This will be charged differently.

739
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,750
Sure, I will immediately install them.

740
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,830
Thanks.

741
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,850
You are welcome.

742

Miss Jiao.

743
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,110
It's been a day.

744
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,960
Should we check on her?

745
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,600
I think we should.

746
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,990
Let's go.

747
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,130
Nan Xing.

748
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,610
Miss Jiao.

749
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,590
Workplace newbies

750
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,290
tend to make some mistakes.

751
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,230
Besides,

752
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,000
you just hit the boss a little.

753
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,590
It isn't a big deal.

754
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,240
Did you all hit him too?

755
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,970
No.

756
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,980
We didn't.

757
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,190
Then it will be over for me.

758
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,460
We should think positively.

759
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,140
You are still here.

760
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,010
Aren't you?

761
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,010
That is true.

762
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,060
Think about it.

763
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,320
You hit the boss twice.

764
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,580
But you are still here.

765
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
What does it mean?

766
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,120
It means you did quite well.

767
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,450
That's right.

768
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,510
You can get off work now.

769
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,940
Go home and have a good rest.

770
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,440
Okay?

771
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,080
Okay.

772
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,730
Don't feel bad, Nan Xing.

773
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,330
Nan Xing, cheer up!

774
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,750
Thanks.

775
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,970
Cheer up!

776
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,060
Thanks.

777
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,020
What are you doing? You startled me.

778
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,679
Don't move.

What are you doing?

781
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,830
Looks like you can't do this on your own.

782
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,020
Do you have photos?

783
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,530
Why do you want them?

784
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,300
Ward off evil, of course.

785
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,020
I don't.

786
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,600
Do you want me to go back?

787
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:03,449
Yes.

788
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,840
If you want it,

789
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:05,810
stop asking.

00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,320
Alright. I will send them to you tonight.

791
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,380
Wait a minute.

792

00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,810
No.

That's good then.

796
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,180
remember not to summon me.

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,490
It looks messy.

875
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,970
Done.

876
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,000
Nan Xing.

877
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,270
Nan Xing.

878
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,780
Nan... Nan...

879
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,250
Miss Jiao.

880
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,720
Nan Xing, I am sorry.

881
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,700
I am so sorry.

882
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,150
I have been too busy today.

883
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,000
I almost forgot about you.

884
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,790
Don't worry about it.

885
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,660
My gosh.

886
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,020
God, did you...

887
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,330
Did you do all this by yourself?

888
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,640
You're so amazing.

889
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,530
I am just physically strong.

890
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,500
That is all I am good at.

891
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,360
Don't say that.

892
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,640
It is amazing that

893
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,270
you can tidy this place up.

894
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,750
Let me put it this way.

895
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,150
If Boss doesn't want you,

896
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,480
I want you.

897
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,210
I almost forgot.

898
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,840
Someone is here for you.

899
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,060
Who?

900
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,960
A super handsome guy.

901
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,690
I think he is more handsome than Boss.

902
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,080
He said he's your neighbour.
