1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,120
Everyone, you've grown up

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,020
giggles with love and life.

33
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,220
Then why can't someone

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,460
erase that number all безotrable versus

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,460
neuron violence?

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,460
It can only be thought of

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,300
as moral lessons.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,220
Where did the leaders

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,240
look when they built the house?

40
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Right.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,020
It's easy to declare

42
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,180
the real middle-class

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,540
The most important factor

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:44,980
is steam.

45
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,120
So when what they did

46
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,520
are equals to every body on this planet.

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
What does it mean?

48
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:59,740
Dis Shane made a home

49
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,340
You... You did all of this yourself?

50
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,340
You're too amazing!

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,740
I'm just a little more powerful. I can't do anything else.

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,140
No, no. You're too amazing to be able to say that.

53
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,740
Let's put it this way. If the boss doesn't want you,

54
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,140
Sister Jiao wants you.

55
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,540
Oh, right. Someone is looking for you at the door.

56
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,140
Who?

57
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,740
Super handsome! Very handsome!

58
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,140
I feel that he's more handsome than the boss.

59
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,540
He said he's your neighbor.

60
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,940
Nanxing, why didn't you tell me that you...

61
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,340
Miss, I'm leaving first!

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,340
You're so handsome! I'm sorry!

63
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,340
Neighbor!

64
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,540
Why did you come to my office?

65
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,940
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

66
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,940
Eat?

67
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,340
What do you want to take me to eat?

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
I want to eat grilled intestines.

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,740
Grilled intestines with a plate is good.

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,540
I want a full pizza.

71
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,340
Xiao Wu Di!

72
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Aren't we going to eat? Why are we here?

73
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,540
How are you going to eat with me dressed like this?

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
Go in.

75
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,740
Hello, Mr. Xiao!

76
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
We're here. I'll leave it to you.

77
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
What's wrong?

78
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,140
Beauty, please come in.

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,340
Xiao Wu Di, let's go eat.

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,740
Beauty, don't worry. Just come with us.

81
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,340
There's no need to be like this.

82
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Let me change you.

83
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
Beauty, are you done changing?

84
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,140
I... Not yet?

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Do you need help?

86
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,540
No!

87
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
Come here.

88
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,340
Are you done changing?

89
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,740
I'm done changing.

90
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,540
Forget it. I'm begging you.

91
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,340
Please save me some face!

92
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,740
Come out and take a look.

93
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,740
This...

94
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,840
You've got a problem?

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,040
I just happened to be having an industrial accident.

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,740
I'm going to rehearsing the part today.

97
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,140
You're going to get beaten to death for that?

98
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,040
Are you here for this?

99
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,940
I was waving at you for a few moments.

100
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,040
Now I'mSon & He.

101
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,940
And we were like that for a couple of months.

102
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Probably

103
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:19,580
really

104
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Come on.

105
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Go in.

106
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Hi.

107
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
Hi.

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Hello.

109
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,940
Hi.

110
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Hi.

111
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Beauty.

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Don't leave, beauty.

113
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,420
Beauty.

114
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Where are you going?

115
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,740
What are you doing this afternoon?

116
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm helping you with your blind date.

117
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,740
Blind date?

118
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,940
Where did you find so many people?

119
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,940
I've registered an account

120
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,460
on all the blind date apps.

121
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,660
This is me?

122
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,420
Of course, your body and appearance

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,820
can't attract so many people.

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,100
So I hired someone to beautify you.

125
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,420
You don't even know my mother, do you?

126
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,700
You look like a rich family.

127
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,020
You're quite popular.

128
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
Look.

129
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,900
Where are you going?

130
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,580
Home.

131
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,220
Okay.

132
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,100
Then I'll tell your mother

133
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,820
my real identity.

134
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
I'm going home.

135
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
What's wrong?

136
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
I'm going out with a friend.

137
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
I'm going to sleep.

138
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Are you going to sleep?

139
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Okay.

140
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Then I'll go with you.

141
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Okay.

142
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
I'll be there.

143
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Okay.

144
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Bye.

145
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Bye.

146
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,940
Bye.

147
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
I'll go with you.

148
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
I'll go with you.

149
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,940
I'll go with you.

150
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
Bye.

151
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
Bye.

152
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
Bye.

153
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
Bye.

154
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Bye.

155
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Bye.

156
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Bye.

157
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Bye.

158
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
Bye.

159
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Bye.

160
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Bye.

161
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Bye.

162
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
Bye.

163
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,500
answer me quickly

164
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,780
OK

165
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,100
I will be there

166
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,620
Ok

167
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Haven't you finished?

168
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,900
Almost

169
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,420
You have to eat it

170
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Chen Zheng.

171
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,340
I'm 29 years old today.

172
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,660
I'm a monkey.

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm a dragon.

174
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,100
I'm a dog like my mom.

175
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,980
Hello, aunt.

176
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm allergic to pollen.

178
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
How about we eat first?

180
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,900
I have a lot to eat.

181
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,020
You eat.

182
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,060
Really?

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,100
I'll eat it then.

184
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,940
Do you like this hairstyle?

185
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,900
It's similar to my old hairstyle.

186
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,100
I know martial arts.

187
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,700
Do you want to learn it?

188
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,100
Thank you.

189
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Your condition is not good.

190
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
But it's okay.

191
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,860
You'll make money if you meet an excellent man like me.

192
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,980
I don't like that kind of materialistic girl.

193
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,940
Fortunately, we have a common goal.

194
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,620
What goal, sir?

195
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,540
Just like you.

196
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,740
Three dolls left.

197
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,660
I want Wu Tong to be my mom.

198
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,340
We don't need to build a good relationship.

199
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,300
You and my parents

200
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,140
can build a good relationship.

201
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,540
I'm unemployed now.

202
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,260
But I think I have a great potential.

203
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,500
It's a potential.

204
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,100
No problem.

205
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm 34 years old.

206
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,660
I'll be happy.

207
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,660
Xiao Wu, you're too much.

208
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,900
You're too much.

209
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,700
You're too much.

210
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,340
Even if I'm single,

211
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,660
I can't be with anyone.

212
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,580
I'll send you home after dinner.

213
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,820
I have to finish a contract.

214
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,380
I have to find a job tomorrow morning.

215
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,620
You don't have to go there.

216
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,300
I can eat whatever I want.

217
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,940
No.

218
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,860
We have to make money no matter how tired we are.

219
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,620
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,340
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,020
I was wrong.

248
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,060
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,700
I didn't expect you to be so kiedy.

252
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,820
Thank you.

253
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Don't be sad.

254
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
Don't be sad.

255
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,900
Eleven to twenty,

256
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
don't be sad.

257
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,300
're he okay?

258
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,980
Why are they crying?

259
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Don't be sad.

260
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
Don't be sad.

261
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
It's okay, answer it.

262
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,820
I'll go to the office now.

263
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,020
I'll go right away.

264
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
I'll go right away.

265
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,380
Hello, I'm calling.

266
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Hello, Mr. Ye.

267
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,500
Hello, Nanxin.

268
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Go to Mr. Lu's house

269
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,460
and bring his completed draft.

270
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,180
I'll send you the address right away.

271
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,940
Where?

272
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,460
I used to go there.

273
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,100
But I should hand it over to you now.

274
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,420
Okay, okay.

275
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,580
I'll go right away.

276
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,940
Help me open the door.

277
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,780
Thank you.

278
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,900
Stop the car.

279
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,540
Where are you going?

280
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm going to the boss's house to get the draft.

281
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
When will you come back?

282
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,900
Still coming back?

283
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
Let's see who you find for me.

284
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,940
You're too picky.

285
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,980
I'm picky?

286
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,140
If I don't pick it,

287
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,540
who will take responsibility for my life?

288
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,140
You?

289
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,100
What responsibility do I have for your life?

290
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,660
Brazil.

291
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,680
What Independence,

292
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,380
how old France?

293
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,740
I was born in India.

294
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,540
A many years old bush.

295
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,660
Don't learn anything from him.

296
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
He's quite~~~~ high.

297
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,140
Diane!

298
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,540
If no one opens the door, the password is 8825252

299
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Boss

300
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
I am Nanxing

301
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
I am not here to get the draft

302
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
Are you home?

303
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Then I come in

304
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Boss

305
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Boss

306
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Boss

307
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
So this is how you write your draft

308
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
So serious

309
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,540
I am the first person in the world who saw this draft

310
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,540
If the fans on the forum know this

311
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
I will be so jealous

312
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
I am so jealous

313
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Help

314
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
Help

315
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Little brother

316
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Help

317
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Little brother

318
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,540
You go and have a look

319
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Don't panic

320
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
I go and have a look

321
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Help

322
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
What's wrong?

323
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
He is still alive

324
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
What a pity

325
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,540
He is dead

326
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,540
He is still alive

327
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
What are you doing?

328
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
It's a rose

329
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Can't you change to another color?

330
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,540
You are so selfish

331
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Ok

332
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
He is your boss

333
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
He is really just fainted

334
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
From the pulse

335
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
He is too tired

336
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,540
He has not enough oxygen these days

337
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
But it's nothing serious

338
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Just a few injections

339
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
If he has not enough oxygen

340
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Should I make him some chicken soup or ginseng?

341
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Or send him to the hospital?

342
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
Who are you?

343
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
Who is he?

344
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I didn't expect it

345
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
It's me

346
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,540
You?

347
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Why are you in my house?

348
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
I am here to get the draft

349
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Ye Qing asked you to come here

350
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Really?

351
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Look at you

352
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
You fainted in the shower

353
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
What's wrong with you?

354
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Not enough oxygen

355
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
Old problem

356
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
There is food in the fridge

357
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Get me some

358
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
You go

359
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
I am too tired

360
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I can't go

361
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
This is

362
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,540
I am her neighbor

363
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
I just sent her here

364
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
Sorry

365
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
I am sorry

366
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Nothing

367
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
We are leaving

368
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,140
I'm really angry

369
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,540
constructive

370
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
I was angry

371
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
so I sent this

372
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
anger

373
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,940
How I...

374
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,540
can...

375
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,540
Video

376
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
why don't you send it to another hamburgerī

377
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,540
I have resigned

378
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Aut HR

379
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,540
But I like bros

380
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I don't really expect

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Ye Qing is muchíre

382
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
특 sag

383
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,300
My heart tells me

384
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,700
I like him because he's been a reader for many years.

385
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,140
I'm not talking about this kind of love.

386
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,980
What kind of love?

387
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,940
It's the kind of love

388
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,500
you want to have with him

389
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,780
with a love that's so strong.

390
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,540
What?

391
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,100
I just admire him.

392
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,020
You should have told me earlier.

393
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,580
I would have helped you to push the waves.

394
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,900
Then this thing is done.

395
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,260
You're too evil.

396
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,420
If love is so simple,

397
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,540
I wouldn't be single until now.

398
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,340
This is simple.

399
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,420
You just don't dare to do it.

400
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,980
I don't dare to do it?

401
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,180
You mean

402
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,620
I can seduce you

403
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,860
and you will fall for me?

404
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,340
Waiting, waiting for whom?

405
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,140
Waiting, waiting for whom?

406
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,580
At this moment, you're also moving.

407
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,780
I guess

408
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,740
there's still a little bit of unease.

409
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,300
The plot is the most romantic.

410
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,740
How is it, little prince?

411
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,980
Are you moving?

412
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,740
Waiting, waiting for whom?

413
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,700
At this moment, you're also moving.

414
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,460
Is it working?

415
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,380
Every day, I'm so used to it.

416
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,700
Stopping, the heart beats faster.

417
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,540
Tell me why

418
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,700
you're always by my side.

419
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,540
What happened just now?

420
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,820
Why does it feel like my heart is beating faster?

421
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
What's wrong?

422
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,660
Are you scared by me?

423
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,940
Am I that scary?

424
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,260
What else?

425
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,660
Are you the one who's bewitched?

426
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,460
You?

427
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Why are you laughing?

428
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,980
Joking aside,

429
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,980
don't take me to blind dates anymore.

430
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,900
It's not necessary for now.

431
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,260
I already have a new plan for this.

432
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,540
What are you going to do again?

433
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,860
Are you going to take me to plastic surgery?

434
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,220
I'll see if it's necessary.

435
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,340
Your boss is a writer.

436
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Yes.

437
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,740
Find a book for me.

438
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,340
You should have one.

439
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,460
I do have one.

440
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Give it to me.

441
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,660
How about this?

442
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,220
You promise me that you won't take me to blind dates anymore.

443
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,180
I'll lend it to you.

444
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,260
Okay.

445
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,780
You're even talking about terms with me.

446
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,900
What about this dress?

447
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,220
I'll return it.

448
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,340
Whatever.

449
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,380
Then the money I return...

450
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,900
Whatever.

451
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,220
It's so good.

452
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,700
This dress is very expensive.

453
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
It's really expensive.

454
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,540
She's wearing a dress and she's going home together?

455
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,140
Is it possible that what I'm expecting is going to come true?

456
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,940
Xiao Wu Jin, you...

457
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,740
You're done?

458
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,780
What?

459
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,020
Cutting your hair.

460
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,500
Get the book.

461
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,700
I don't have hair.

462
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,620
Here it is.

463
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,060
Every work from her debut to now.

464
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
It's all here.

465
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,100
Be gentle.

466
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,740
I'm afraid you'll spill the water on it.

467
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
Drink it first.

468
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
It's best not to drink it.

469
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,540
I told you to be gentle.

470
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,900
This book is so good.

471
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Look.

472
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,460
This is a signed version.

473
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
It's very precious.

474
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,460
I'm so happy.

475
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,460
I'm so happy.

476
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,460
I'm so happy.

477
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
I'm so happy.

478
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,460
I'm so happy.

479
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Is it pretty?

480
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,140
If it's pretty, I'll go to Douban and get a five-star.

481
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
You're still not leaving?

482
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,140
Are you going to spend the night with me tonight?

483
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,340
No need.

484
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
I'm leaving right now.

485
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Look carefully.

486
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Be careful.

487
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,740
You still say you don't like it.

488
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,740
I'll study this guy for you.

489
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,740
Mom, you scared me.

490
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Why are you laughing?

491
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,540
Are you so happy that you won a prize?

492
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,340
I won a special prize.

493
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,540
I thought I would never win this prize in my life.

494
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
How much did you win?

495
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,940
What money?

496
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,140
You're so vulgar.

497
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,740
As long as I can marry you, I can even pay for the ticket.

498
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,740
I know there's nothing good about it.

499
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,740
Where did you go with Xiao Xiao today?

500
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,340
I went to eat with her after work.

501
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
You ate?

502
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Just eating.

503
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,340
Why did you buy new clothes?

504
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,940
Mom, don't put me in a bad mood with her.

505
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,340
There's no relationship between her and me in this life.

506
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,340
At most, it's a

507
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,100
a

508
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,340
Don't be so stubborn.

509
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,540
You want me to write a book that I can't touch or read.

510
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,340
I can borrow it just because I want to.

511
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,140
I wanted to struggle for it.

512
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,940
But I thought I had to borrow it.

513
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Why bother myself?

514
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,140
What do you mean?

515
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Mom, it's late.

516
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
You're still awake.

517
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,540
I'm not sleepy.

518
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm sleepy. I have to get up early tomorrow.

519
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,140
Good night.

520
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,540
Xiao Ning, you should take a nap tomorrow.

521
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,140
Okay.

522
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,540
I'm back.

523
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,940
I'm back, mom.

524
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,540
Let's have delicious and not fat salad for lunch.

525
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,740
I won't eat at home for lunch.

526
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,540
Are you going out?

527
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,140
Where are you going?

528
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,940
I'm going to take off my clothes.

529
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,540
You look so good in this dress.

530
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
Don't take it off.

531
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,940
This doesn't suit me.

532
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
Sometimes a boy is not

533
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,340
so delicate.

534
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,540
But when you go shopping later, tell him

535
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,940
I like this, this, this.

536
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,340
I don't like this, this, this.

537
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,140
How many times does he know what you like?

538
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,340
Who are you talking about?

539
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Who else?

540
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,140
Xiao Xiong.

541
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,540
I'm shopping with Sisi, not with him.

542
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,740
Not Xiao Xiong?

543
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,340
Yes.

544
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,340
What's wrong?

545
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,140
Come here now.

546
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
Now?

547
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,740
I'm going out to take off my clothes.

548
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
Wait a minute.

549
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,940
Come here first.

550
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,540
You said it's not him.

551
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,940
I really don't follow him.

552
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,540
Okay, okay.

553
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,940
You don't have to explain it to me.

554
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,340
Come on.

555
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,740
Go.

556
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
I'm leaving.

557
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,140
Bye.

558
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,940
You did all these?

559
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,740
The result of last night.

560
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,740
Why did you do these things?

561
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,140
Know yourself, know your enemy,

562
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,340
and you can win every battle.

563
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,740
Knowing your enemy

564
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,940
is the first step to capture him.

565
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,540
You want to capture our boss?

566
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,740
Not me, it's you.

567
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,740
Lu Zichen has a lot of

568
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,740
places to dig.

569
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
I'm not going to let you go.

570
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,540
I'm going to take you to the hospital.

571
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,340
There are still a lot of places to dig.

572
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,540
His father.

573
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,940
Lu Zhengliang.

574
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,140
A great businessman.

575
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,940
The father of the engineer.

576
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
The chairman of the charity family,

577
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,740
Lu Group.

578
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,740
I knew it all along.

579
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,140
Although his family is very rich,

580
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,940
our boss is a good man.

581
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,740
Good man.

582
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,940
Then why is there a name

583
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,740
of Lu Zhengliang on your company's shareholder list?

584
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,540
Lu Zhengliang must have

585
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,340
funded his first business capital.

586
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,940
Maybe his father did

587
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,740
fund him a little.

588
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,540
But the boss's writing is all about talent.

589
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,940
It doesn't matter if he's not talented.

590
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,340
I don't care.

591
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
What matters is that

592
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
he can deduce his taste

593
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,740
from his birth.

594
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,140
What taste?

595
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,540
The taste of women.

596
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
When it first started,

597
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,940
I was a little hesitant.

598
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,140
But last night,

599
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,340
after reading all his novels,

600
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,940
I can basically judge

601
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,540
that the woman Lu Zichen likes

602
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,940
is the female protagonist

603
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,140
in his novel.

604
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,740
Su Yu?

605
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,140
This woman

606
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,340
has a higher IQ than him.

607
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
She has the same good education background as him.

608
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,940
She is calm, decisive,

609
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,540
medium-length, and slim.

610
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Her height is about 1.70 meters.

611
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Her appearance

612
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,140
is about this tall.

613
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,740
Do you understand?

614
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,340
Understand what?

615
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,540
This woman

616
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,740
has nothing to do with you.

617
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,140
You've lost completely

618
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,340
in terms of IQ.

619
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,940
Although

620
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
I can help you

621
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,940
disguise these things,

622
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,740
you can only use your appearance

623
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
and body to use a knife.

624
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,340
What knife?

625
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,140
Didn't we agree not to use it?

626
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,540
You don't have to pay a price

627
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,940
to pursue Lu Zichen.

628
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,340
Don't you like him?

629
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,540
If you two are together,

630
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
I'll be free.

631
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,940
Why can't I

632
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,540
get over this?

633
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,340
I told you

634
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,540
he is my boss and idol.

635
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,740
You're going to date your boss?

636
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Isn't this how you act in idol dramas?

637
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,540
I can't say anything anyway.

638
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I'm warning you.

639
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,340
If you keep doing this,

640
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,140
I'll die with you

641
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,740
and make you regret it for the rest of your life.

642
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,140
I'm done.

643
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
You'll be

644
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,540
the last one.

645
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,940
Your order.

646
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Thank you.

647
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,140
It looks so nice.

648
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,940
Let me see.

649
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
It's so expensive.

650
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,140
Stop looking.

651
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,340
You can't afford it.

652
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,740
I like it.

653
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,140
Let's go.

654
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,540
I'll pay for it.

655
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,140
Let's go.

656
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,340
Sister,

657
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,740
are you really going to be fooled?

658
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
You didn't buy

659
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,140
such a woman's clothes.

660
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,940
You must have bought it.

661
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
What?

662
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,340
She even took the money back?

663
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,940
What money?

664
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm here to help her return the clothes.

665
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,140
I didn't break up with her.

666
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,340
Who broke up with her?

667
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,140
No.

668
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,940
I've never been with her.

669
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,540
Really?

670
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,740
Do I have to lie to you, Xiong Sisi?

671
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm so worried about my job.

672
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,140
I don't have time to fall in love.

673
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,940
What's there to worry about?

674
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,740
What are you worried about?

675
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,140
What's there to worry about?

676
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,140
I don't understand.

677
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,140
Our boss

678
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
doesn't seem to like

679
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,340
others to be his assistant.

680
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,740
I think

681
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,540
I'm about to be fired by him.

682
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,740
You're being domineering.

683
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,940
Show me your face.

684
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,140
It's not about being domineering.

685
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
Think about it.

686
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
I'm a retired athlete.

687
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,340
I'm not professional.

688
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,740
I don't have any work experience.

689
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,140
I have to learn from my experience.

690
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,940
I'm domineering.

691
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,140
I'll be very happy

692
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,740
if I lose my job.

693
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,340
And I have a feeling

694
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,540
that your flower will bloom soon.

695
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,340
It will bloom soon.

696
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Okay, I'll treat you to a meal.

697
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,540
I'm a big star.

698
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,740
I have to be a big star.

699
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,340
Spicy soup.

700
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,140
What?

701
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,340
Didn't you just take the money?

702
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,740
This is the money of the enemy.

703
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,940
It has nothing to do with me.

704
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
It's about the spicy soup.

705
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,340
Where should I start?

706
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,740
Is Xiao Xiong home?

707
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,740
Auntie, wait a minute.

708
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
Xiao Xiong.

709
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,740
Hello, Auntie.

710
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,540
You haven't eaten yet, right?

711
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,940
I made some more for you.

712
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,140
In case you order takeout.

713
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,940
It's delicious.

714
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,140
Xiao Xiong,

715
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,540
you said you were a blind date consultant, right?

716
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Yes, Auntie.

717
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,340
I've been doing this recently.

718
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,540
Then what do you think of our Nan Xin?

719
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,740
Auntie, don't worry.

720
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,540
I've been looking for her recently.

721
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,340
I will definitely find one that will satisfy you.

722
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,740
I'll find one for you.

723
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,140
Okay.

724
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,140
They really don't have anything to do.

725
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,140
This is too hard.

726
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,140
Using a spoon will be more convenient.

727
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,140
My son used to be like this before.

728
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
He used to be like this to me.

729
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,540
You really look like Xiao Jun.

730
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,540
No matter how bad my cooking is,

731
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,540
it can still be delicious.

732
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
Auntie,

733
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,740
Auntie,

734
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:49,940
you said your son is referring to Nan Xin and her brother?

735
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,340
Did Nan Xin tell you about our family?

736
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,540
She said that there was an accident before.

737
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,940
And then she lost a very important person.

738
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,340
When I was in middle school, I had a fire.

739
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,540
Since then, I've had a little sequelae.

740
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,540
But the person who can open my heart

741
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,540
is no longer there.

742
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,540
Actually, I'm not her biological mother.

743
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
At that time,

744
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,540
we were neighbors for more than ten years.

745
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
I was alone with my son.

746
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,940
We lived across from each other.

747
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,540
Nan Xin and her father lived in this house.

748
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,340
Our relationship was always very good.

749
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,540
Later, Nan Xin's father and I...

750
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,940
But before we were able to establish our relationship,

751
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,540
the three of them encountered that fire.

752
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,540
After that,

753
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,540
I became her mother.

754
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,540
It was a kind of misfortune.

755
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,540
God left me a daughter.

756
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,540
It was also from that moment that this house was empty.

757
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,540
Nan Xin didn't let anyone in.

758
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
The person who can live in this house

759
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,540
is also her biological mother.

760
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,540
She was also the one who had to leave.

761
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,540
She was the one who was most important to her.

762
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Look.

763
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,540
I've made this atmosphere heavy.

764
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,540
It's all from years ago. Let's not talk about it.

765
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
Oh, right. I also signed some fruit for you.

766
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,540
Last time, you said you didn't eat oranges, right?

767
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,540
I still remember that, Auntie. Thank you.

768
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
It's delicious.

769
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Nan Xin didn't let anyone in.

770
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,540
So, the person who can live in this house

771
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,540
is definitely the most important person to her.

772
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,540
How is it, Young Master?

773
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
Have you fallen in love?

774
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,540
Why is this woman so troublesome?

775
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,540
I've returned the dress.

776
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,540
This is the 2,000 yuan I returned.

777
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Why am I so scared?

778
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,540
Can I be normal?

779
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
I've returned the dress.

780
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,540
This is the 2,000 yuan I returned. Take it.

781
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Should I be more polite?

782
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,540
I've returned the dress.

783
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
This is the 2,000 yuan I returned.

784
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Thank you.

785
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Why should I thank her?

786
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I should throw money on her face.

787
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,540
I should take your money and return it to her.

788
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,540
I...

789
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
You're going to quit so soon?

790
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,540
I've been training for so long.

791
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Am I someone important to her?

792
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,540
This guy still wants me to go after my boss.

793
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,540
How can I let him give up?

794
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Are you still thinking about me and my boss?

795
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
I won't go after my boss even if you kill me.

796
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Why?

797
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,540
Are you in love with someone?

798
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,540
Are you scared?

799
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,540
It seems like a good idea.

800
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,540
I am.

801
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,540
I do have someone I like.

802
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Who?

803
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,540
You...

804
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,540
How can I be shy to tell you?

805
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,540
Anyway, don't waste your time on me.

806
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,540
So he really likes me.

807
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,540
I should think about it.

808
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,540
I am.

809
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,540
I love you.

810
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Yang Xing, would you like some coffee?

811
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,540
Who can drink coffee at night?

812
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Me.

813
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
I can drink anything.

814
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
You...

815
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
I'm going to open the door.

816
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Coming.

817
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
Who is it?

818
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Come with me

819
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Take me out

820
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,540
What are you doing again?

821
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
I promise you

822
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Promise me what?

823
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
You like me

824
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
I promise to be friends with you

825
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
I promise to be friends with you

826
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,540
I'm sorry

827
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I'm sorry

828
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540

I'm sorry

832
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
I'm sorry

833
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
I'm sorry

834
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,540
I'm sorry

835
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
I'm sorry

836
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
I'm sorry

837
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,540
I'm sorry

838
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
I'm sorry

839
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,540
I'm sorry

840
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,540
I'm sorry

841
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,540
I'm sorry

842
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
I'm sorry

843
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,540
I'm sorry

844
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm sorry

845
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
I'm sorry

846
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,540
I'm sorry

847
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
I'm sorry

848
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
I'm sorry

849
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,540
I'm sorry

850
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,540
I'm sorry

851
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
I'm sorry

852
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
I'm sorry

853
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,540
I'm sorry

854
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,980
I'm sorry

855
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,180
I'm sorry

856
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,180
I'm sorry

857
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
I'm sorry

858
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
Did on that day

859
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,180
He thought he was really mean

860
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180
He considered meignty

861
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
He agreed

862
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,480
You

863
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Or aprechen

864
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,520
Or!

865
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,120
Sometimes, I look at your playful smile.

866
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,520
Maybe the atmosphere is just right.

867
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:00,520
My hero always takes the time to chase away all my worries.

868
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,520
Oh, every corner.

869
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Oh, turning into the soil of love.

870
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,520
A special relationship, a little bit of care.

871
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,520
A little bit of care, maybe this represents my heart.

872
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Oh, every corner.

873
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Oh, the next day we promised.

874
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,520
We accidentally came close and had a tacit understanding.

875
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,520
If you like me, then I'll be your hero.

876
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Let's go.
