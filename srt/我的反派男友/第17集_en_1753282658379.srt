1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
You've been in love with a local couple.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,240
Have you considered going with them?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,600
Do you know

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,880
all fruits are olive as fresh fruit?

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,920
Leave it to you.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,520
Leave everything to me.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,200
Here.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,240
It can't be taken back.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,960
Leave it to me.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,200
It's not your business.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Guess who I am

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Write the most touching story

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a meeting with you

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Before the promise is made

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I throw away the pen

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Call for fate

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the distant space

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I hear you here

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You are destined to be with me

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come to me

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Stay with me

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are the four seasons and the past

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The life that never changes

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Come for me

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Stay with me

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Once the look fills my heart

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be with me

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Long Ballad

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 2

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Come on

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Boss, I thought you were not here

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm here to give you the schedule for this week

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The meeting you need

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I have already marked it for you

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Put it down

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ok

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You won't be home after the meeting, right?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you have a meeting with me and Mr. Ye today?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There is one at eleven o'clock

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Boss

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is your friend

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What happened to Mr. Ye?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If he is not in good condition

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can put that meeting back

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can't you see if I'm in good shape?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will attend the meeting

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Cancel all other jobs

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ok

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't care about what you said

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I care

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you so confident about me?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's just pretend that this thing

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Has never happened, ok?

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
During the meeting, we found that

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Most of the people

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Are very important to the boss's opinion

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So we hope

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The boss can

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Except for the special prize

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Give other works

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Make some comments

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't you know the boss's time

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is the time ok?

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is Lu Wei's work about the fourth?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is the time ok?

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Four works plus a special prize

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The draft amount is about 200,000 words

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ok

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want to know why

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We are talking about the new plan

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to know why

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You think it will fail

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The boss's schedule

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Has been confirmed by the general judge

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He has a movie change meeting

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
To attend

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
After confirmation

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Arrange it with Mr. Shi

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mr. Ye

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ok

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Boss

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know what you want to say

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I just can't do it

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Pretend nothing has happened

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You didn't go home last night, right?

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll call the company driver to send you back

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't need

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ok

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll ask you for a leave

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll go back to rest for a few days

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll come back when you've adjusted

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't allow you to take a leave

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you keep being like today

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In front of your colleagues

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How can we continue to work together?

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What I want is not to be with you

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want to work with you

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What do you want?

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you want me to resign?

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Resign is ok

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please don't make it more complicated

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In addition to the special award

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The boss of the movie that entered the film

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Must have a short review

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And then you must follow up

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then this is ours

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Ye

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mr. Ye

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The president's office

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Put the company related to me

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The project is all summarized

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Including all the details

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Send it to me

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mr. Ye, our projects here

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All related to you

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then send it to me

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it is good

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Teacher Shi

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are here too

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
All the physical books in the editing department

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Project progress details

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You organize it and send it to me

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I hope everyone before work

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Put it all together

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Send it to my mailbox

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you all

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
it is good

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Nanxin

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come with me

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You want to meet Xiao Wu Di alone

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I want to ask him to talk about the problem of the manuscript

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But the contact list doesn't have his phone number

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can you help me ask him?

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is there anything else?

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Go to work

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, okay

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm going to work

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Nanxin, what are you looking for?

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Nothing

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You put that

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll find it again

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is the PR department

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The PR department also needs it

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hello

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hello, is Mr. Xiao?

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We are here

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No, you called the wrong number

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hang up

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't hang up first

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm kidding

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why don't you answer my phone?

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You called me so late

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't complain

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where is it late?

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's not lunch time

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I thought you were missing me

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
At most, it can last an hour

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to work

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Isn't it good to call someone at work?

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And I have to raise you

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Unemployed boyfriend

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have to work harder

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let me tell you

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You don't have to work too hard

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you mean?

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have a surprise for you

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What surprise?

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What surprise is it now?

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you have something to do tomorrow morning?

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What's wrong?

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You want to ask me out?

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go on a trip?

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's our Mr. Ye

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He wants to talk to you about the draft

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ask me out?

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And it's a private appointment

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The kind that doesn't take me

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Listen

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Our boss seems to be in a bad mood today

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He seems to have a fight with Mr. Ye

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And Mr. Ye said he wanted to talk to you alone

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think it's weird

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you want to ask him?

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You don't have to ask him

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You and Lu Zichen

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You'd better not say a word

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Except for working

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You can talk to him occasionally

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hello, boss

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Just kidding

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's funny

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can help me to promise him about the night treat

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It should be about the contract

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You don't have to worry

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We'll go there together tomorrow morning

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, that's it

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll tell him you promised

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Dong won't have time to eat with you this afternoon

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm a little busy today

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Can you pick me up tonight?

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I want to take you to a place

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll see the schedule

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If there's no accident, it's okay

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Wait and see

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You scared me to death

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay, bye

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Bye

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Surprise

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't be radar

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The last again

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's time to everybody in Shengnan

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Later..

218
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
What are you stealing?

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,780
Surprise? You said some surprise you got me.

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Where's it?

221
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,120
ASG?

222
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,120
Birth Test?

223
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,500
Where did this come from?

224
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,140
I wrote it by myself.

225
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,760
Why would you print it?

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,880
It's illegal.

227
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,140
After I get this thing,

228
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,720
I can fall under the house JES,

229
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,880
Then I can take the college entrance examination.

230
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Think about it.

231
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,800
With my intelligence,

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,960
I can take the college entrance examination

233
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,560
without any problems.

234
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,280
Give me some time.

235
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,440
Don't you like this company?

236
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,880
I spent three or five years

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,520
working for the company.

238
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,080
Lu Zichen and Ye Qing

239
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,880
were kicked out of the company.

240
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
Then the whole company is ours.

241
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
What do you want?

242
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
No, absolutely no.

243
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,800
How can you think so?

244
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Ha ha.

245
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Why are you laughing?

246
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,960
I know you don't agree.

247
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm just kidding.

248
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
I won't do this.

249
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
With my intelligence,

250
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,080
I can find a job outside.

251
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,080
Those jobs like university professors

252
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,520
are easy to get.

253
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,840
At worst,

254
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
I'll sacrifice myself

255
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,600
to get into the entertainment industry.

256
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't worry.

257
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,840
I will be responsible

258
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,440
for our future.

259
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,120
I didn't expect you to think so much for me.

260
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
But I have to delete this.

261
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,400
Because it's really illegal.

262
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,120
Okay, delete it.

263
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
I've been working for a day.

264
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,440
You don't have to do this.

265
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,240
Don't worry.

266
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,280
I'll support you.

267
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,400
Let's go.

268
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,520
I'll take you to a special place.

269
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,080
Look.

270
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,600
Look.

271
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
The classroom over there

272
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,520
is where I used to go to class.

273
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,800
I used to walk through this corridor every day.

274
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,640
At that time,

275
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,440
I didn't seem to be able to

276
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,920
fall in love with someone in the campus.

277
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,600
There is a love shrine in our school.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
It's a lotus pond.

279
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,400
It's over there.

280
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,920
There are many ducks in the pond.

281
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
Two ducks

282
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,800
stick together every day.

283
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
I even named them.

284
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,160
One is called Wang.

285
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,560
The other is called Ba.

286
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,360
Because they are the same name.

287
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,840
Why are you so bad?

288
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,200
I thought

289
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,640
I must fall in love.

290
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,840
So I can

291
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,000
walk around the pond with the one I like every day.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
We can talk while walking around.

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,560
If we can walk around five circles a day,

294
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,720
we can walk around

295
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,400
1825 circles a year.

296
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,040
1825 circles?

297
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
You don't have so many words to talk about.

298
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,280
Isn't it a topic that can't be finished when you fall in love?

299
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,600
But that's just a fantasy.

300
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,000
So far,

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
I haven't walked around a circle.

302
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Let's go for a walk.

303
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,920
Okay.

304
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,920
Where is the pond?

305
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,320
Why is it flat?

306
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,560
It's not flat.

307
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,320
It's okay.

308
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Let's

309
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,000
go to the classroom where you went to school.

310
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,320
We're almost there.

311
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
That's the classroom.

312
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,160
What does it mean?

313
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,640
Game SEAS is to gain manager Humans' ass.

314
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,560
That Watch time

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Game its revenue

316
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
is익ens as a weapon

317
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,760
That's where the gradually expansion information

318
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,720
that can be used

319
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,040
isn't the purpose of the strategy.

320
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,680
Who?

321
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
The author of the book

322
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,960
No.50

323
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
There was a boy in our class

324
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
who was a English class representative

325
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
He would arrange English homework

326
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
on the blackboard every day

327
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,640
But he would leave

328
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,160
an English letter U at the end

329
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,960
We didn't know what it meant

330
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520
We finally understood it

331
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,000
when we graduated

332
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,600
What does it mean?

333
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,800
He confessed to the girl he liked on the day of graduation

334
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,120
Her name is Lin Xingyou

335
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,160
They were together?

336
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,080
They were together after the confession?

337
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Do I look okay?

338
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,200
들itäten

339
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,320
Sorry for them.

340
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,400
Do you feel better now?

341
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,040
How do you feel?

342
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
What are you two doing here so late at night?

343
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Why are you so early?

344
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
You came to talk to someone

345
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
You should have come earlier

346
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
It's all because of you

347
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Did you wake up?

348
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Wake up

349
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
It's still early

350
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Mr. Ye is not here yet

351
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I think he is still in the office

352
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
I think he is still in the office

353
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I think he is still in the office

354
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I think he is still in the office

355
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I think he is still in the office

356
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Mr. Ye should not be here yet

357
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
You should wait for a while downstairs

358
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Ok

359
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
You go to work first

360
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I will take a walk downstairs

361
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Then I will go to him myself

362
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Then come to me after the meeting

363
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Bye bye

364
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Bye bye

365
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I will go with you

366
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Come in

367
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Please sit

368
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Please sit

369
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Sorry

370
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
This is for others

371
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Mr. Xiao

372
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
You have seen the meeting

373
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Among all the authors who entered the circle

374
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Only you and Nanxing are partners

375
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
So I hope to understand

376
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
The relationship between you

377
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
The way of division and the distribution of benefits

378
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
This question

379
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
It should be ok to ask Nanxing

380
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Why do you want to find me

381
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Because you are a clear person

382
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
So I don't have to come back

383
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I know very well

384
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Nanxing's creative level

385
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
My anti-派 boyfriend's work

386
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Whether it's literary style or emotional

387
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Completely from Nanxing's literary writing

388
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
So I personally hope

389
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
In the future, our contract conditions

390
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Can add

391
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
The way you distribute your benefits

392
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
This can make Nanxing reasonable

393
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Let Nanxing get the income she deserves

394
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Listen to you

395
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Are you worried that I will cheat Nanxing's money

396
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
I think with Nanxing's personality

397
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Probably

398
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
She won't talk to you about money in advance

399
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
So this is what I need

400
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
The risk of evading in advance

401
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
It's quite thoughtful for Nanxing

402
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
If I just want to cheat her money

403
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
I just don't sign a contract with you

404
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
What can you do

405
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Then I will use the way of literary writing comparison

406
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Kick you out

407
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I have a copy of Nanxing

408
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
The manuscript created before entering the company

409
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
As long as two manuscripts are compared

410
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
You can find that your contribution is not big

411
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Star-like

412
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
I asked Nanxing

413
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
The male lead of this manuscript

414
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Also blame you

415
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
It's just that you are a big anti-派 inside

416
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
And that's it

417
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I will write it for you

418
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,040
If Lu Zichen is for the Jianghu

419
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Bring light and hope to the hero

420
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Then this person is hiding in the abyss

421
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Poisonous snake in the human world

422
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
He is the devil between the people

423
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
And the devil between the palm

424
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Someone once said

425
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,040
If this person is kind

426
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
That's the blessing of the world

427
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
He is the young master He Huan

428
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Xiao Wu Di

429
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
You said

430
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
This was written by Nanxing before entering the company

431
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Is there any problem

432
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I used to write the same person

433
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Now suddenly let me write the original novel

434
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
I don't know what to write

435
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Wait, you can write novels

436
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Why don't you show me

437
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
I wrote all the romance novels

438
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
You don't like to watch

439
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Just like the first movie we watched today

440
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
That kind of type is similar

441
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Mr. Xiao

442
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Xiao Wu Di

443
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Xiao Wu Di

444
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Xiao Wu Di

445
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Xiao Wu Di, what's wrong

446
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
What did you talk to Mr. Ye

447
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Is there something wrong with our little city

448
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Who are you

449
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
You are Xiao Wu Di

450
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Before you called me

451
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
I was afraid that you would be angry

452
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
You know who I am, right

453
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
So I didn't cross over, right

454
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Xiao Wu Di, listen to me

455
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I am just a character in a novel

456
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
I am a villain in the novel you wrote

457
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,040
I am a devil known as a devil, right

458
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
So I didn't cross over

459
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
I am a villain, right

460
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I am a villain, right

461
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Xiao Wu Di

462
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Xiao Wu Di

463
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Xiao Wu Di

464
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Xiao Wu Di

465
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Xiao Wu Di

466
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Xiao Wu Di

467
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Xiao Wu Di

468
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I am sorry

469
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
I am a little busy now

470
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Let me stay for a while

471
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Xiao Wu Di

472
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Xiao Wu Di

473
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I can't see him now

474
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Xiao Wu Di

475
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Xiao Wu Di

476
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Before you called me

477
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
You knew who I was, right

478
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
I am just a character in a novel

479
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,040
I am a villain in the novel you wrote

480
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,040
I am a devil known as a devil, right

481
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
I didn't mean to lie to you

482
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Xiao Wu Di

483
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I didn't mean to lie to you

484
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,620
förklazy

485
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,320
只🎵

486
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
Come in.

487
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,200
Ms Ye, looking for me?

488
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,280
Sit down.

489
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,280
I know you are cooperating with Xiao Wu Di.

490
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Your relationship is good.

491
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,280
I can also see that he is a very smart person.

492
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
He does things a little bit...

493
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
not quite in line with common sense.

494
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
But when I was showing him

495
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,280
the horoscope you wrote,

496
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
his reaction made me think

497
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,280
that I might have misunderstood your relationship.

498
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I think if he were to do something like that,

499
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
he would have misunderstood your relationship.

500
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Are you two...

501
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
No.

502
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
That...

503
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,280
I buried it for myself.

504
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Am I a little too busy?

505
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I can do something to...

506
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
No, Ms. Ye.

507
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
My dad actually

508
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,280
was also busy with your business.

509
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
It's you and your boss.

510
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,280
He always came to ask me, so I...

511
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I knew about this a long time ago.

512
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
You knew?

513
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I never told you about it.

514
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
You can guess from his actions

515
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
and your reaction.

516
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
I'm sorry, Ms. Ye.

517
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,280
But our boss really cares about you.

518
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
He has worked hard behind your back.

519
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
I know.

520
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
This is not your fault.

521
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Don't take it to heart.

522
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Oh, right.

523
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,280
I actually wanted to help you and Xiao Wu Di

524
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,280
to decide on your cooperation before you leave.

525
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
But I really didn't think that I...

526
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
You...

527
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,280
You just said you were leaving?

528
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
But...

529
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,280
What if you leave the company?

530
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
What about the company?

531
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
It's okay.

532
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
It's okay if the company is without anyone.

533
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
It's okay.

534
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
You guys are here.

535
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Oh, right.

536
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Keep this a secret for me, okay?

537
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,280
How can I keep it a secret?

538
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,280
How can I...

539
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,280
How can I...

540
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Stop crying.

541
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Stop crying.

542
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Don't cry anymore.

543
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Don't cry anymore.

544
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Stop being sad.

545
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,280
So I'm just a character from a novel.

546
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,280
I'm not the real person in this world.

547
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
What about the River Palace?

548
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
What about my master?

549
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Because I...

550
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I've never had a father or a mother since I was little.

551
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,280
So my master adopted me.

552
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,280
I lived in the River Palace with him since I was little.

553
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,280
At least at that time,

554
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I was still considered to have a family.

555
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,280
So everything about me didn't exist.

556
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Yes.

557
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Little half- 오른 father.

558
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Are you home?

559
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,280
If you're home, just knock on the door.

560
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
I'm really worried about you.

561
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Mom, I'm home.

562
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
You're home?

563
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Wu Xiu, I still don't know how to face you.

564
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Wu Xiu

565
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
I've prepared a seafood meal for you.

566
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
You ordered a cake?

567
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
It's so cute.

568
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
It's a dessert for our meal.

569
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
This is not for you.

570
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Then who is it for?

571
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
This is for someone else.

572
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I can't eat what's for you?

573
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
No.

574
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,280
You can eat my food. Why can't I eat yours?

575
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Someone else asked me to keep it for him.

576
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
You can't eat it either?

577
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Fine, forget it.

578
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Go wash your hands and eat.

579
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Mom, I'm not eating at home.

580
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I've eaten.

581
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I want to go out for a walk.

582
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
But this seafood meal...

583
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Why isn't he back?

584
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
He's probably not thinking about it.

585
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
No, he's not.

586
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
He's not that stupid.

587
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I can't see him right now.

588
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
He can't just disappear.

589
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
He's not here.

590
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Did he waste you?

591
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,800
She senior?

592
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,260
She junior?

593
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,820
She senior?

594
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,360
Father?

595
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,260
Father?

596
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,040
Save her.

597
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,280
Come.

598
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
Come.

599
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,800
I...

600
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
I don't want to talk with you.

601
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Her older brother is here.

602
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,960
Her older brother is here.

603
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,060
Tell me.

604
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,600
What are you looking at?

605
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,420
I'm not punishing her.

606
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,360
I just don't know how to tell her.

607
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
I'm not the one who told him to wait for me here.

608
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,880
I told him that I don't want to see him.

609
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,080
He insisted on waiting for me here.

610
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
How could he blame me?

611
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,800

You keep Cyberpunk.

615
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,560
All because of you.

616
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,400
Nan, time, time,

617
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,680
What's she doing

618
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,640
We are going to find Sister,

619
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,120
Give her back her masked.

620
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,400
What are you doing?

621
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
I'm waiting for someone.

00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,520
You're so impatient.

623
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,200

628
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,760
