1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,560
I know these words.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,720
I want to see.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,200
How can you be the one that helped me run the health center?

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
Who helped you with the horn-crab?

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,600
I'll see you off.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,040
But you didn't tell me.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Yeah.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,080
I did tell you, mom.

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
You still don't understand.

45
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
Understand what?

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,960
The rules of summoning.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,080
I seem to be more confused.

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,320
The first time I summoned you

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,760
was when I was embarrassed.

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,400
The second time I summoned you

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
was when I was in danger.

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,800
You said I needed a hero

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
who could save me.

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
But I didn't need to be saved

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
the last two times.

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
Nothing happened.

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,560
I thought so too.

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
But now I've found out

59
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
the real important thing

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,800
is not the state you were in when you summoned me.

61
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,680
It's the result after you summoned me.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
The result?

63
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,600
I helped you solve the problem

64
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
when you summoned me for the first time.

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,920
I saved your life the second time.

66
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
The third and fourth times,

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,720
I helped you wipe your mouth

68
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,640
and gave you a shoulder to lean on.

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Understand?

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
You still don't understand?

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,040
I helped you solve the problem

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
when you were embarrassed.

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I protected you when you were in danger.

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,160
I took care of you when you were tired.

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
What you need is a...

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,200
A perfect boyfriend.

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,480
What?

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,320
The thing about the promise

79
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
won't be discovered, will it?

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Stop joking.

81
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,440
I'm not joking.

82
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
Since I first came here,

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,040
you've been lying to me.

84
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,080
You've been lying to me until just now.

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
What's your wish

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
with that fairy?

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,080
What else can I wish for?

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,960
I just said

89
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,600
I want a love that's not a secret.

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,680
What?

91
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,920
I want a love that's not a secret.

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you want me to help you

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,720
pull out your tongue and make it clear?

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
I said I want a love

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
that's not a secret.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
I want to help you pull out your tongue.

97
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
But I don't know

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,840
why things happened

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,600
to be like this now.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Don't look at me like that.

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,400
There's a CCTV around here.

102
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,880
You know there is CCTV.

103
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,080
Then why are you talking nonsense?

104
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
I was late

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
I was bullied by someone.

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
So I just said it.

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,640
Do you know what kind of consequences

108
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,160
you will have if you talk nonsense?

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
I just said it.

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,760
I didn't expect the consequences.

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,840
Alright.

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
You deserve to have

113
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
a love that's hard to get.

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Stop dreaming.

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,760
Why don't I deserve

116
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,120
a love that's hard to get?

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,720
Thank you.

118
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,680
You're welcome.

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,000
Dreaming is not enough.

120
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,560
If you can achieve your dream in real life,

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,000
who would dream about it?

122
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Besides,

123
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,560
what's wrong with me?

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm not good at stealing.

125
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't need to rely on my parents to find a job.

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,200
I have shortcomings

127
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
besides being single.

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
Love that's hard to get.

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,880
You can't win me.

130
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,040
And I fell in love with such a girl.

131
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,240
She's a pervert.

132
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,360
If she dares to harass me again,

133
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll kill her

134
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
and kill her.

135
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I'm sorry.

136
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm sorry.

139
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm sorry.

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
bit.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
e.

143
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,440
Miss,

144
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,880
did you forget that

145
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
Li Dan will be with you today?

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,320
Super.

147
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
for the ancient people,

148
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
it's actually a crisis.

149
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,080
This is a fork.

150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Natural gas.

151
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,040
This is a red and green light.

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
You must respect the rules.

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,320
Don't use light.

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,480
You can't hit people.

155
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
You can't kill people.

156
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,880
You can't rob people.

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
You can't just

158
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,240
enter someone else's room.

159
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Remember.

160
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,760
If you need an ambulance,

161
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
please call the emergency.

162
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Lastly,

163
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,560
this is my phone number.

164
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,440
But only in emergency

165
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
can you call the ambulance.

166
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,040
Come on, Little Butterfly.

167
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,160
You must live well.

168
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,620
Can you do me a favor?

169
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:06,900
particle

170
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,940
It's raining.

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
I don't have a umbrella.

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
No need.

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I don't need you.

174
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I can do it.

175
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Just be the rain.

176
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
What does it matter?

177
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
I said I don't need you.

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Do you want to come back and dig a hole?

179
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
I just made that wish.

180
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I just want to eat the meat.

181
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I just want to eat the love that I'm obsessed with.

182
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
What do you think?

183
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
You want a love that's hard to come by.

184
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I'll give it to you.

185
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
What's wrong?

186
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
No.

187
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I can't agree.

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm not saying you're not a good person.

189
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Of course, you're not a good person.

190
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I just want to say that we've only known each other for a few days.

191
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
You told me such a big thing.

192
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I didn't think about it.

193
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
And how can I explain to my mom?

194
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
How can I explain to my parents?

195
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
I just found a job.

196
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
My career just started.

197
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
You don't even have a job.

198
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
You don't even have a certificate.

199
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
How are you going to get married to me?

200
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
How do you get the child into the household registration?

201
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Stop dreaming. Who wants to give birth to a child with you?

202
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
You don't want to have a child?

203
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Not me.

204
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Don't you want a love that's hard to come by?

205
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
You didn't say it had to be me.

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I can just find a man in my dreams.

207
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
That makes sense.

208
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
As long as you find me a boyfriend,

209
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
your mission is over.

210
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I wish so.

211
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
But before I was born,

212
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I would still call you over.

213
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
So we have to hurry up.

214
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I have a limited patience.

215
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
If I can't stand it one day,

216
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I'll be like a water ghost looking for a substitute.

217
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
That's what I mean.

218
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
We have to find a man

219
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
and give him your cake.

220
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
I don't want it.

221
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Who?

222
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
You're so bold.

223
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Grandpa, I heard rumors.

224
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
The guys in our team

225
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
are so mean to me.

226
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I don't even want to

227
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
be your concubine.

228
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Fine.

229
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I'll be your concubine.

230
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Okay.

231
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'll go see him tomorrow.

232
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Okay.

233
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Then tomorrow,

234
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
bring more money.

235
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Let's go home.

236
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
It's raining.

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
This is my umbrella.

238
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Why are you so slow?

239
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Walk faster, okay?

240
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Xiao...

241
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Surprise!

242
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Mom?

243
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Xiao...

244
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
So handsome.

245
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Xi...

246
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Yi Ong Xiong.

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Xiong?

248
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Xiong.

249
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Yes.

250
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Mom, he's Xiong Si Si's cousin, Xiong Wu Di.

251
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Hello, aunt.

252
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
So he's Si Si's cousin.

253
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I also...

254
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Right, just right.

255
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Today is Nan Xin's first day at work.

256
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
I came back to make a big meal.

257
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Let's eat together.

258
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Okay.

259
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Come on, come on.

260
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Come in.

261
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
You can go back to 302 first.

262
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
I'll...

263
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Come in.

264
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Okay.

265
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
How can I explain it?

267
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I never give you a reasonable identity.

268
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Am I saying that

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
you're an ancient man

270
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
sent by the fairy?

271
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
A man never changes his mind.

272
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Haven't you heard of it?

273
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I've heard of it. I know.

274
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
But I've already said it.

275
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
How can I change it?

276
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Xiong Xiao Wu Di.

277
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Xiao Xiong Wu Di.

278
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Xiao Xiong Wu Di.

279
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
I think it's okay.

280
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
You're not angry.

281
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
Mom, what are you two doing?

282
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Come and eat.

283
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Come on.

284
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Eat first.

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I'll go get some fruit.

286
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
This dish is so...

287
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Eat.

288
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Don't you think

289
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
it's a bit...

290
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
You want to eat your own?

291
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Is this orange delicious?

292
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
It's delicious, aunt.

293
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Here, eat some fruit to relieve your stress.

294
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
This is the orange that Nan Xing loves the most.

295
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
You must eat it.

296
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It's delicious.

297
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
It's delicious.

298
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
It's delicious.

299
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
It's delicious.

300
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
You must eat the orange.

301
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
I'll go and clean it up.

302
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Okay.

303
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
You eat first.

304
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
You don't eat it?

305
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
You're so picky.

306
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
I don't eat oranges.

307
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
It tastes weird.

308
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Mom.

309
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Did you cut the chili

310
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
and not wash it?

311
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I forgot again.

312
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I'll pour you some water.

313
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Come on.

314
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Drink some water.

315
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Thank you, aunt.

316
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Are you okay, Xiao Xiong?

317
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I'm fine.

318
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
How is it?

319
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Is it delicious?

320
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
This dish is very delicious.

321
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Really?

322
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Then eat more.

323
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Okay.

324
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Xiao Xiong.

325
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Where do you live?

326
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I live across the street.

327
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Across the street?

328
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,160
He just came here and there's no place to live.

329
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
So I rented 302 to him.

330
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
His father stayed there.

331
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
He hasn't lived there for many years.

332
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
We wanted to rent it out.

333
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
You've already lived there?

334
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Yes.

335
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
It's very efficient.

336
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
What do you usually do?

337
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
He...

338
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I didn't ask you.

339
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
I usually do...

340
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Help others find a job in love.

341
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
I know.

342
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
You're a blind date consultant, right?

343
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
In this respect,

344
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
you have to help Nan Xing to have a good look around.

345
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
If he relies on himself,

346
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
he will definitely have no chance.

347
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Mom.

348
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
The dishes seem to be burnt.

349
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Do you want to go and have a look?

350
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Yes, I'll go and have a look.

351
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Mom.

352
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
It's okay.

353
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Hurry up.

354
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
What are you doing?

355
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Mom, he's a little thin.

356
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I'll send him back first.

357
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
I'm really leaving.

358
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Be careful. Come and eat.

359
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Don't take my mom's words seriously.

360
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Well,

361
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
do you feel dizzy?

362
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Do you want to throw up?

363
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Do you want to throw up?

364
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Do you have a chest pain?

365
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
None of them.

366
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
This is so strange.

367
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
It's rare that someone eats my mom's cooking.

368
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
It's so normal.

369
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
If you feel uncomfortable in the second half of the day,

370
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
you can call me.

371
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I'll give you medicine.

372
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Stop talking nonsense.

373
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Don't forget about tomorrow.

374
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Tomorrow?

375
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Grab the substitute.

376
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
You really don't forget, do you?

377
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Are you really going?

378
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
See you tomorrow.

379
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I think this little bear is really good.

380
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
He's talented and well-educated.

381
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Where did you see him so well-educated?

382
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Don't think I don't know how bad my cooking is.

383
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Except for that little boy,

384
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
it's the first time I've seen someone

385
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
eat my cooking so deliciously.

386
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
What does that mean?

387
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
It means he has a cold.

388
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
It may also be that he has no right to taste.

389
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Anyway, I think it's good.

390
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Think about it.

391
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I...

392
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
I can't be with him.

393
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Why not?

394
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
It's impossible for you to rent the house to him.

395
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
How many people have seen that house before?

396
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
You've rejected them all.

397
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Why rent it to him?

398
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
What should I do?

399
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I can't let him stay in my room.

400
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
This is a very good opportunity.

401
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I'll do it when I should.

402
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Mom, I don't have the heart to think about that now.

403
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
The boss likes you very much

404
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
on the first day of work, right?

405
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Our boss didn't come.

406
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
It's normal that the boss doesn't come.

407
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
The boss is so busy.

408
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
He can't go to the company every day.

409
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Look at me.

410
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
I don't go to the company every day, right?

411
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
You have to take your time when you just go to the company.

412
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Get familiar with the company's information,

413
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
environment, and colleagues.

414
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
But I didn't do any of these.

415
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Cheer up.

416
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Don't forget what exercise and birth control teach you.

417
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Don't give up.

418
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Okay, have a good rest.

419
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Okay.

420
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Here you are.

421
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Just in case.

422
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
One day later

423
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I said I want a hateful,에asa love.

424
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I help her find a good person.

425
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Go back soon.

426
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Okay.

427
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Xiaowu.

428
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
You're here.

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll pick you up.

430
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm leaving.

431
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Good morning.

432
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm afraid someone's calling you too quietly.

433
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,760
I can't hear or wake up.

434
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Actually,

435
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,200
what can you do if you go?

436
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,720
I want to hear the screams that others make.

437
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Do you have money?

438
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Fried chicken snacks!

439
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Fried chicken snacks!

440
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Fried chicken snacks!

441
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Fried chicken snacks!

442
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I want to try it too.

443
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
It's spicy.

444
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
This one is original.

445
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
This one is spicy.

446
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
This is not a good idea.

447
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Why don't you come and see us?

448
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I haven't started working today.

449
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Little brother.

450
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Do you want to eat fried chicken together?

451
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
You guys be careful.

452
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Don't ask me.

453
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Can I eat here?

454
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Okay, you must agree.

455
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
There are still a lot over there.

456
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Senior.

457
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Senior.

458
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
How's the work?

459
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Don't be nervous.

460
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm not good at picking peach blossoms.

461
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Me?

462
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Don't get me wrong.

463
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Our senior is usually very sincere.

464
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Although she is a good boy,

465
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
it's all brotherly relationships.

466
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
There are no peach blossoms and flowers.

467
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Why?

468
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Because everyone likes the kind of girl

469
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
that ordinary people like.

470
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
What kind of girl do ordinary people like?

471
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Smart and shy.

472
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
She is very feminine.

473
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Very gentle.

474
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
She even dresses up.

475
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Anyway, she is different from our senior.

476
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
What are you talking about?

477
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Otherwise, how could she be so good at being single?

478
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Single?

479
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Think about it in another way.

480
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
She may be waiting for you all the time.

481
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Right?

482
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
How romantic she is.

483
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Little brother.

484
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Do you have someone as handsome as you?

485
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
I can be worse than you.

486
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
I can.

487
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Like your cousin, your cousin,

488
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,640
or something like that.

489
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Eat more.

490
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Okay.

491
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Shou Sisi.

492
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
I didn't do anything.

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I just chatted with her.

494
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,640
I'm afraid I can't find a substitute for her.

495
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Can I go back?

496
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
What did you talk about?

497
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I wish you two happiness.

498
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
What?

499
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
I don't have that kind of relationship with her.

500
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't be so silent, Shijie.

501
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,680
She was the one who took care of your sportswear that day.

502
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
I think she is...

503
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,680
She is my guest.

504
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I took her sportswear because there was an accident.

505
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Don't think too much.

506
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
What?

507
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Then I'll go out.

508
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Come back with me.

509
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
I'm dying.

510
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
You're dying?

511
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
What?

512
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Where is this?

513
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Listen to me.

514
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
From today on,

515
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
don't have any relationship with her.

516
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Even if you meet her on the road,

517
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
you have to go around her.

518
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Do you hear me?

519
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm doing this for your good.

520
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Okay.

521
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I know.

522
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
And,

523
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
don't go to my house recently.

524
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
You'd better not see my mom.

525
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Why?

526
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Why?

527
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Eat fried chicken.

528
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
The coach will be here soon.

529
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Okay.

530
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Come on.

531
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Come on.

532
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
How's this?

533
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
What's wrong with you?

534
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm thinking if I can go back.

535
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
You have to go back.

536
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
You can't lose your confidence.

537
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
What's good about us?

538
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Air pollution,

539
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
global warming,

540
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
and the pace of life is so fast.

541
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
How can it be so comfortable?

542
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Okay, I know.

543
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
You go to work first.

544
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
I'll figure out how to deal with it by myself.

545
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Okay, I'll go first.

546
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
By the way,

547
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
my mom said you've rented it.

548
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
She wants to change some new furniture for you.

549
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Okay.

550
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Xiaodi,

551
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
come on.

552
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Don't give up.

553
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Okay.

554
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Good morning, Jiang Xia!

555
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Nanxing, why are you here so early?

556
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I used to be a trainee in the team.

557
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,400
I'm used to it.

558
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,880
Where did you get so many flowers?

559
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,760
You're quite emotional.

560
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,760
Good morning, Miss Jiao.

561
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
Morning.

562
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,040
I saw a bottle of flowers on the table yesterday.

563
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Although it's not mine,

564
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
it can make people feel better.

565
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,800
So I prepared it for everyone today.

566
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
I hope I can perform well.

567
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,160
Miss Jiao, this is for you.

568
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,280
It's so beautiful.

569
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,600
Thank you, Nanxing.

570
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Miss Jiao, what do I need to do today?

571
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,520
Well...

572
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,480
Xiao Chu,

573
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,680
didn't you say

574
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,240
you need help from Nanxing?

575
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
I have some tickets here.

576
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,120
I need to paste them.

577
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,680
When you paste them,

578
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,640
if you have any questions,

579
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
you can contact me anytime.

580
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Okay, no problem.

581
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,480
Stick them well.

582
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,000
Miss Jiao,

583
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,240
look at this.

584
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,600
Xiao Chu, this is for you.

585
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,320
Okay, I'll put it here.

586
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,160
Yufan, I'll put it here.

587
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,440
I'm allergic to flowers.

588
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
Give it to Xiao Chu.

589
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,400
Thank you.

590
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,000
This kid is quite weird.

591
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,280
If he's really fired,

592
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,520
it's a pity.

593
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,360
Boss Ye's attitude towards his assistant

594
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,040
is unbearable.

595
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,440
What do you mean?

596
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,480
One day.

597
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,960
Boss will come to the company today.

598
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,240
Okay.

599
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,000
Good morning, boss.

600
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,560
Good morning.

601
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,080
You're an athlete.

602
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,960
You never give up.

603
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,960
So why did you give up

604
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,160
your career?

605
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,360
I...

606
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Why are you still here?

607
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,240
Boss,

608
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,040
he's your new assistant,

609
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,960
Nanxing.

610
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,920
Mr. Ye has met him.

611
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,160
I'm done.

612
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm done. I'm fired again.

613
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,600
Boss will be upset.

614
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,120
Nanxing,

615
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,720
don't worry too much.

616
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,520
I don't think he'll do it again.

617
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,640
What's wrong with that assistant?

618
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
Didn't we agree on the assistant?

619
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,320
Listen to me.

620
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,560
He can't even speak.

621
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
What assistant?

622
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,480
I asked him to help you.

623
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,800
I didn't ask him to chat with you.

624
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,160
And that girl is bold and careful.

625
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,520
She's very hardworking.

626
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
She's an old reader of yours.

627
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
She knows you well.

628
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,360
She should be able to calm your temper.

629
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
You know you need someone to help you.

630
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,280
But you can't always change your assistant.

631
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,440
Give her more time.

632
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,720
One week.

633
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,480
If she doesn't let me change my assistant within one week...

634
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,600
I'll let her leave.

635
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,880
I'll give you breakfast.

636
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
I didn't know you were coming.

637
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,880
So I didn't prepare your favorite milk.

638
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,920
What's your boyfriend's name?

639
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Song Jiaming.

640
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,000
So when did you two start dating?

641
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,480
Just recently.

642
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,680
How did you two meet?

643
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,520
We met in golf.

644
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,680
We met in golf.

645
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,520
We're going there this weekend.

646
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,520
Together?

647
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
I don't like golf.

648
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,280
That's right.

649
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,280
You need a boyfriend, right?

650
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,360
Boss Lu.

651
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm a human being.

652
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
I need my own life.

653
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,840
I'm not a work machine bought by our company.

654
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,800
I...

655
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,080
I didn't mean that.

656
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Is the contract okay?

657
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,400
You can sign it.

658
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,440
Thank you.

659
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,240
Do you like it?

660
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,280
The necklace looks nice.

661
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,880
It's a birthday gift.

662
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,520
Boss Lu.

663
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,360
Have you signed it?

664
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,080
I need to change.

665
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,040
Give it to me right now.

666
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,280
You'll remain with us forever?

667
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Nanxing.

668
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,980
We didn't even But his球队男行

669
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,520
that finally sparred just now.

670
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,720
It's bad news.

671
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
What should I do?

672
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
No matter what, I have to talk to him.

673
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,720
I have to leave a good impression on him.

674
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Don't be nervous.

675
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Just like usual.

676
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
What's wrong with you?

677
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
What are you doing?

678
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Are you crazy?

679
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,720
You'd better not say it.

680
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll write a draft at home this week.

681
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
I have nothing to teach you.

682
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
You can stay here or go home.

683
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
No, how can I stay?

684
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Don't be so polite.

685
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I can go to your house and stay with you.

686
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I can do it myself.

687
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
I don't have anything to talk.

688
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm in the middle of work.

689
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Keep your eyes peeled for me.

690
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Xingte.

691
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Mr. strip.

692
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Kill me.

693
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,620
she's feminine

694
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,140
and dress herself up

695
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,620
but not our senior

696
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,740
Clearly not

697
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,200
What should I do?

698
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,740
Your express delivery is here

699
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,760
Where should I put it?

700
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,400
Change the TV in the living room.

701
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,040
Change the curtains in the living room.

702
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Me?

703
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,560
That's another price.

704
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,520
Okay, I'll put it in for you right away.

705
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,400
Thank you.

706
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
It's my duty.

707
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,400
What is your main stroke?

708
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,920
It's just the sides of my body.

709
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,520
How is my condition?

710
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,400
Yang Xi?

711
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,320
Is it me or a woman with dumplings?

712
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,100
See?

713
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,000
Old bitternessing!

714
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
耳朵冷暖不足

715
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,440
Ice and cold oil can't be used for cleansing.

716
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,240
It just blood sugar cookie C or agina C crois swear.

717
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Sister Qiao, a newbie at work can make mistakes.

718
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,640
Besides, you just hit the boss.

719
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,440
It's not a big deal.

720
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,640
You all hit the boss?

721
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,840
No, we didn't.

722
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
No, we didn't.

723
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Then we're done for.

724
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,440
We have to think about the good things we do.

725
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,640
We're staying, right?

726
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,040
Yeah.

727
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,240
Think about it. You hit the boss twice, and you stayed.

728
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,240
What does that mean? It means you did a good job.

729
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,440
Yes.

730
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,640
Then you should clean up and get off work.

731
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,440
Go home and rest early, okay?

732
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,040
Okay.

733
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,240
Don't feel bad, Nanxia.

734
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,840
Nanxia, you can do it.

735
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,040
Thank you.

736
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
You can do it.

737
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
Thank you.

738
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,440
What are you doing?

739
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,240
Don't move.

740
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,440
What do you want?

741
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,440
What are you doing?

742
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,440
It seems like you're not doing anything.

743
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,640
Do you have any photos?

744
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,240
No.

745
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,640
What do you want?

746
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,240
Put it on your bedside.

747
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,440
No.

748
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,040
Do you want me to go back?

749
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,840
Yes.

750
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,240
If you want me to go back, don't ask so much.

751
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,640
Okay, I'll send it to you later.

752
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
Wait a minute.

753
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
Are you not happy today?

754
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,440
No.

755
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
That's good.

756
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,240
No matter what happens, don't call me.

757
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,440
I know.

758
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,440
I know.

759
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,240
I can't do it anymore.

760
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,440
I'm the only one who can do it.

761
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Mom, I'm leaving.

762
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,840
Nanxia, you lock the door. I'm running late.

763
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
Everything will be fine.

764
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,240
You have to believe in yourself.

765
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,640
Come on.

766
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,840
Xia Wudi.

767
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,440
Come on.

768
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Xia Wudi, I'm here to bring you breakfast.

769
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,240
My mom made breakfast for you.

770
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,640
She bought a new TV.

771
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,240
She changed the curtains.

772
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,440
I'll put it on the tea table.

773
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,440
I wonder why she used my photo.

774
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm here to bring you breakfast.

775
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,040
I don't want to eat.

776
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,440
Okay.

777
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,840
I'm going to work.

778
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
I'll stand here.

779
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,640
I'll go to the bathroom.

780
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,840
I'll go to the bathroom.

781
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

782
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

783
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
I'll go to the bathroom.

784
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,040
Here you go.

785
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,240
I won't come in again.

786
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Sorry.

787
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,160
Thanks

788
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,120
Thank you

789
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,840
Hello

790
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,840
M một minut

791
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,120
S voila

792
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm still by your side

793
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
A fight

794
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,360
겠습니다

795
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
You're acting like bad boys

796
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,640
Sister

797
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
I come again

798
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,080
Hey

799
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,560
You know I love you

800
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,040
Say it

801
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Nanxing, you hit the boss yesterday, but you still dare to come to work today.

802
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
What's wrong?

803
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Nanxing, you...

804
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Come on.

805
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Sister Jiao.

806
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Sister Jiao.

807
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,440
They seem to be discussing about me hitting the boss yesterday.

808
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Can you stop gossiping behind other people's backs?

809
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
No, Sister Jiao.

810
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,440
I'm going to work now.

811
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Nanxing, good morning.

812
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Sister Jiao, do you need me to do anything today?

813
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
The boss...

814
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
asked me to be on standby at any time.

815
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,440
You can tell me anything you need me to do.

816
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
I don't have anything.

817
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I've done with my work.

818
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
There's nothing else to do, Sister Jiao.

819
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
They are so annoying.

820
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
I'm going to go to the office.

821
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
They've done with their work.

822
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
There's nothing else to do.

823
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
You can do anything.

824
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
You can do some training.

825
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
How about...

826
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Xiao Chu,

827
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
can you get the paper box that you need to store the food in,

828
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
and let Nanxing help you?

829
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
It's here.

830
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Thank you.

831
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
No, it's not hard at all.

832
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
I'm going to the office.

833
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
I'll be back in a minute.

834
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm going to the office.

835
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
I'm going to the office.

836
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
I'm going to the office.

837
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I'm going to the office.

838
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm going to the office.

839
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I'm going to the office.

840
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,440
I'm going to the office.

841
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
I'm going to the office.

842
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm going to the office.

843
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm going to the office.

844
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm going to the office.

845
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
I'm going to the office.

846
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
I'm going to the office.

847
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm going to the office.

848
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
It looks a little messy.

849
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,080
bekin tarot cards

850
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,220
In addition,

851
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,920
I am treating you to minibus tickets

852
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,720
If you don't collect them at all,

853
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,920
there will be more charges

854
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,220
In addition,

855
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,520
if you pay for the etc..

856
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,540
you will beants

857
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,920
We can pray for your safety

858
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,000
some problem

859
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,880
And also

860
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,480
thirteen tr supplements

861
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
My goodness.

862
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Oh my goodness.

863
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
You...

864
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
You did all of this yourself?

865
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
You're amazing.

866
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I'm just a little more experienced.

867
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I don't know how to do anything else.

868
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
No, no.

869
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,480
You're amazing for saying things like that.

870
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Let's put it this way.

871
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
If the boss doesn't want you,

872
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Sister Jiao wants you.

873
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Oh, right.

874
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Someone is looking for you at the door.

875
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Who?

876
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Super handsome.

877
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Super handsome.

878
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I think he's more handsome than the boss.

879
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
He said he's your neighbor.

880
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,480
The sun brings a new day

881
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,480
to run with you

882
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480
You are the god

883
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,480
who has walked through my lonely bridge

884
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
and accompanied me

885
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Occasionally, I am in your gentle smile

886
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Maybe the atmosphere is good

887
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,480
My hero always can keep up with the report

888
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,480
and drive away all my troubles

889
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Oh my goodness

890
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Oh my goodness

891
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
Every corner

892
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
Oh my goodness

893
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Oh my goodness

894
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Becomes the soil of love

895
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
A little bit like a star

896
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
in a special relationship

897
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Maybe this represents my heart

898
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
Oh my goodness

899
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
Oh my goodness

900
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Every sunset

901
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Oh my goodness

902
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,480
The next day I promised

903
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,480
I accidentally got close to the tacit understanding

904
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,480
I'll be your hero if you like me

905
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Let's go now

906
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
The sun brings a new day

907
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
to run with you

908
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,480
You are the god

909
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,480
who has walked through my lonely bridge

910
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,480
and accompanied me

911
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Occasionally, I am in your gentle smile

912
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Maybe the atmosphere is good

913
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,480
My hero always can keep up with the report

914
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,480
and drive away all my troubles

915
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Oh my goodness

916
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh my goodness

917
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Every corner

918
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Oh my goodness

919
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Becomes the soil of love

920
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
A little bit like a star

921
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,480
in a special relationship

922
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,480
Maybe this represents my heart

923
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Oh my goodness

924
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Oh my goodness

925
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
Every sunset

926
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Oh my goodness

927
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,480
The next day I promised

928
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,480
I accidentally got close to the tacit understanding

929
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
I'll be your hero if you like me

930
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,480
Let's go now
