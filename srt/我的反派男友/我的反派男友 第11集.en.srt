Why did you have to keep it to yourself?

I'm afraid I would affect your work.

I'm fine, there's no
need to go to the hospital.

36

Seems like you're
really not having a fever.

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,220
I'll go to work now.

174
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,660
Alright,

175
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,620
don't you worry.

176
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,090
Okay,

177
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,020
you take good care of yourself

178
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,420
and finish the porridge.

179
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,180
Here, have some more porridge.

180
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,490
It's okay, Aunt Nan.

181
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,300
I'll do it myself.

182
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,370
You're ill severely,

183
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,500
how could I let you do it yourself?

184
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,180
Here, I'll do it.

185
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,890
It's... it's fine.

186
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,020
I can have it myself.

187
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,700
You...

188
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,220
I'll do it myself.

189
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,550
You... you alright?

190
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,470
I'm alright.

191
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,620
Don't rush it.

192
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,660
You finished it?

193
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,460
I'll pour you some more.

194
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,590
It's okay, Aunt Nan.

195
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,690
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

196
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,140
Are you okay?

197
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,340
I'd like to take a nap.

198
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,070
Lie down.

199
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,140
Here.

200
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,660
Cover up nicely.

201
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,960
Take a rest.

202
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Morning, Haitao.

203
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,040
Morning, Nan Xing.

204
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,180
Morning.

205
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,340
Boss.

206
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,020
Why are you here?

207
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,990
I'm waiting for you.

208
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,860
Waiting for me?

209
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,340
Are you again...

210
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,660
Boss, what's wrong with

211
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,190
that friend of yours again?

212
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,420
Didn't you say that

213
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,140
we let them have multi-planned encounters?

214
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,060
This friend of mine actually
did exactly the same.

215
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,420
and date her out

216
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,500
to an art exhibition.

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,100
He also expressed

218
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,180
that dating her to the art exhibition

219
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,660
is only because she likes it.

220
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,140
But Miss Ye doesn't seem

221
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,380
to understand what he meant.

222
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,940
Do you think

223
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,180
he should continue dating her?

224
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,460
One moment, Boss.

225
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,860
You asked too many questions.

226
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm not sure

227
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,930
which one to answer.

228
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
You can tell me how you feel about it.

229
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,420
My feeling?

230
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,940
I find it weird.

231
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,720
Two adults, man and woman,

232
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,980
suddenly dated each other

233
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,510
with multiple encounters.

234
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,180
Usually, people would think further right?

235
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
How could Miss Ye not think further?

236
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,270
It's not sudden.

237
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,900
They used to go out
with each other frequently.

238
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,580
What do you mean?

239
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,540
Before Miss Ye

240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,820
becomes the CEO,

241
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,580
they always go out with each other.

242
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,140
Basically everyday.

243
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,660
It's not like...you guys...

244
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,700
It's all because of work right?

245
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,780
Yes, what's wrong with it?

246
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,500
It's...

247
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,860
You should...

248
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,940
That friend of yours

249
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,660
should think about the problem

250
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,260
from Miss Ye's point of view.

251
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,540
What to think about?

252
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,620
According to what you said,

253
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,380
Miss Ye is someone who's

254
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,100
all time

255
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,740
being in a working mode.

256
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,660
So she must have treated everything

257
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,460
as work.

258
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,620
However,

259
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,140
she must have time off from work, right?

260
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,230
You have a point.

261
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,460
I do.

262
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,740
You do.

263
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,180
I wonder if Xiao Wudi's fever

264
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,240
is gone down or not.

265
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,250
[Young Master Xiao]

266
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,830
Are you feeling better?

267
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,350
Aunt Nan.

268
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,780
Cover up.

269
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm fine now, really.

270
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:53,780
No.

271
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,860
You were not covering enough.

272
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,100
I don't feel any cold now.

273
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,900
You're cold.

274
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,750
Cover up.

275
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,710
I'll go and get you some warm water.

276
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,550
Thank you, Aunt Nan.

277
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,520
[Young Master Xiao]

278
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,380
Why is Xiao Wudi not replying my WeChat?

279
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,620
[Aunt An]

280
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,220
Why is my mother not picking up the phone?

281
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,020
He won't get sicker, will he?

282
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,860
Nan Xing.

283
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Have you prepared the meeting materials?

284
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,160
I am preparing.

285
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,780
Xiong.

286
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,660
You're inside for half an hour.

287
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,390
Are you okay?

288
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,410
Aunt Nan, I'm alright.

289
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,740
You...

290
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,950
Then are you going to stay any longer?

291
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,260
I probably still

292
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,540
need a little longer.

293
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,830
I know what to do.

294
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,300
Xiong.

295
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,140
Yes, Aunt Nan.

296
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,300
I'll give you something.

297
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,760
It will be helpful.

298
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,620
So that's about it for

299
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,900
our book signing schedule

300
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,230
in recent three months.

301
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,099
Yufan,

302
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,770
you're responsible for

303
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,180
connecting with our local partners

304
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,859
handling the itinerary

305
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,540
and venue, things like that.

306
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,069
Alright.

307
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,020
Nan Xing,

308
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,380
Boss's hotel and flight ticket bookings

309
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,099
will be
your responsibility this time, okay?

310
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,740
Okay.

311
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,780
That's all.

312
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,500
Dismiss, off work.

313
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,610
What's going on with her?

314
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,740
You're back.

315
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,620
Mother, why are you here?

316
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,380
Where else should I be?

317
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,500
Why aren't you taking care of Xiong?

318
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,900
He's recovered already.

319
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,290
So soon?

320
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,150
He recovered in the afternoon.

321
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,940
It's working.

322
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,300
What are you cooking?

323
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm cooking some porridge for Xiong.

324
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,900
Coincidentally,

325
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,760
I also came back

326
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,080
to make him something.

327
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,410
You didn't add in any

328
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,060
weird ingredients, did you?

329
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,860
I'm not being innovative today.

330
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,940
For a sick person,

331
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,090
we better not.

332
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,540
Good then.

333
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,580
But we could still add in some vegetables

334
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,700
and some meats.

335
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,220
I'll wash some cabbage.

336
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,750
Alright.

337
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,390
This illness will not recover
if it remains any longer.

338
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,350
Are you really okay now?

339
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,770
Yes, I am.

340
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,100
My mother is really good.

341
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,150
She cooked you some porridge,

342
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,200
and I cooked you

343
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,460
two fried eggs.

344
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,740
Thank you.

345
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,030
I'm here to check on you.

346
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,820
You've recovered and I'm not worried now.

347
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,940
I'll go now then.

348
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,620
Seems like I need another trick.

349
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,820
I really don't know how to keep writing.

350
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,100
Or,

351
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,580
I'm simply not suitable
for original writing.

352
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,380
Power cut?

353
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,340
I don't know.

354
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,020
Do you have power in your room?

355
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,260
No.

356
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,800
What's happening?

357
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,750
I don't know.

358
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,020
I'll go check out the electricity meter.

359
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,100
What's going on?

360
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,300
I'm not sure.

361
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,700
It didn't trip.

362
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,620
We didn't owe any bills.

363
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,540
You see, the lights are still on

364
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,660
in other houses.

365
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll go find

366
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,740
the number for electricity company

367
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
and call them up.

368
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,390
Alright.

369
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,740
You scared me.

370
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,880
What's wrong with you?

371
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,780
What are you doing here?

372
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,780
-What's the matter?
-I'm...

373
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,860
Nan Xing, are you okay?

374
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,780
Who are you?

375
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,350
Madam An.

376
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,050
Xiong?

377
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,900
You...

378
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,780
I just got back from shopping.

379
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
The power is cut here?

380
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Yes.

381
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,260
We don't know the cause.

382
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,990
Do you have power at your place?

383
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,280
Let me check it out.

384
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,700
No power.

385
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
That's weird.

386
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,060
Why is there no power only in our house?

387
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,900
It's probably circuit failure.

388
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,740
Such issue

389
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,340
couldn't be fixed anytime soon.

390
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,940
Plus it's quite late now.

391
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
There shouldn't be
any technician available.

392
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,340
Why don't you guys stay over my place

393
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
for a night?

394
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,560
-Alright.
-It's not too good, right?

395
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,300
There's no other way.

396
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,140
At this hour,

397
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,300
we can't even shower without power.

398
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,470
I think tonight

399
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,490
we'll have to settle down here

400
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,490
at Xiong's place.

401
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,940
I'll go

402
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,820
pack up some daily necessities.

403
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,460
This bear...

404
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
It's cute, right?

405
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,580
The hairline is too high up,

406
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,380
too distant between eyes,

407
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,180
too big of a tummy,

408
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,940
how is it cute?

409
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,980
Not as handsome as Xiong.

410
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,510
Not cute.

411
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,940
How cute.

412
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,900
Your aesthetic view

413
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,420
really doesn't fit mine.

414
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,740
You're obviously not
my biological daughter.

415
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,650
How could you say that to me?

416
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,220
Don't cry.

417
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,340
I take it back.

418
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,740
Our connection is stronger than bloodline.

419
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,620
That's enough, mother.

420
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,140
Done.

421
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,060
Aunt Nan.

422
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,980
The room is cleaned and ready.

423
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,220
Tonight, you guys can

424
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,020
settle here.

425
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,300
I apologize, Xiong.

426
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,660
You just recovered from illness

427
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,900
and you're taking care of us.

428
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,810
Sorry for the inconvenience.

429
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,580
It's alright.

430
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,020
This is what I'm supposed to do.

431
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,080
As the saying goes,

432
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,940
a close neighbour is better
than a distant relative.

433
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,540
Also,

434
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,900
this is your own place.

435
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,560
You can stay as long as you want

436
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,860
You're quite generous.

437
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,590
Are you the one paying the rent?

438
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,300
What rental?

439
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,300
The rent for the second half of the year.

440
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,780
What are you in a hurry for then?

441
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,840
It's empty anyway.

442
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,180
You can let Xiong stay.

443
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,420
Xiong,

444
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,380
if she urges you for the rental again,

445
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,940
you can tell me.

446
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,340
I'll be in charge for you.

447
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,870
Thank you, Aunt Nan.

448
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,220
By the way,

449
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,260
I just got the hot water ready.

450
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,680
Aunt Nan, do you want to

451
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,660
shower first?

452
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,660
I'm not tired.

453
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,700
I'm not even tired.

454
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,940
It's not even late yet,
I'm not sleepy at all.

455
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,780
[Not tired?]

456
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,060
[How could I be alone with]

457
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,770
[Nan Xing then?]

458
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,820
One, two, three.

459
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,160
Finally, all three of us get together.

460
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,020
Let's play "Fight the Landlord".

461
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,060
Sure.

462
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,800
I think I don't have poker cards here.

463
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,940
I do.

464
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,820
Are you ready?

465
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm getting the landlord.

466
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm getting it, I'm calling it.

467
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,660
Landlord.

468
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,060
Are your cards that good?

469
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,960
These cards...

470
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,420
Do you regret now?

471
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,940
My cards are too good.

472
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,580
Do you want it?

473
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,500
He can't take it.

474
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,530
Because the "Big Cat" card is with me.

475
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,700
Arrogant.

476
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,240
Are you kidding me?

477
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,260
Paired Two.

478
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,740
Paired King.

479
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,740
What cards do you have? Let me see.

480
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,470
Sticker strip, sticker strip.

481
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,020
Here.

482
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,420
Done.

483
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,220
Mother has to get one too.

484
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,420
Me too?

485
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,590
You lost as well.

486
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,580
You guys are a team now.

487
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,490
Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

488
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,530
Boom!

489
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,980
One last card, four.

490
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,780
I won!

491
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,410
I...

492
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,860
I'm left with three cards.

493
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,620
Nine.

494
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,180
Play the card.

495
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,980
Do you want it?

496
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,380
Burst with the King card.

497
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,060
I won again.

498
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,420
Don't let it fall.

499
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,480
Each fallen one gets another ten.

500
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,660
Burst with the King card!

501
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,100
We won again!

502
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,330
We won again!

503
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,780
I'll shuffle the cards.

504
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,310
Hand it over, I'll shuffle.

505
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,140
It's too fun.

506
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,100
Let's shuffle.

507
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,840
We should play this everyday.

508
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,180
It's fine.

509
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,820
Staying here onwards

510
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,860
means

511
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,960
there will be more time together.

512
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,440
By then, making her

513
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,980
do everything with me

514
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,500
will be easy, won't it?

515
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,940
You're awake, Aunt Nan.

516
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,740
Xiong,

517
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,460
you did all these?

518
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,980
Have a seat, Aunt Nan.

519
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,500
You're too good.

520
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,540
Nan Xing.

521
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,620
Come here, Nan Xing.

522
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,620
Look.

523
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,760
You made these?

524
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,420
Of course, not.

525
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,780
It's all done by Xiong.

526
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,340
Xiong, it's really a surprise

527
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,540
that you're so good at cooking.

528
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,780
It's still far worse compared to

529
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,910
Aunt Nan's cooking.

530
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,900
Now that's a little bit overblown.

531
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,210
How is it overblown?

532
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,090
I wake up early everyday,

533
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,480
to make you meals...

534
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,140
Yes.

535
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,320
I know, mother.

536
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,130
Let me get you a bowl of porridge.

537
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,420
Forgive you then.

538
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Xiong,

539
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,460
we don't wake up so early tomorrow.

540
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,480
You went out of your way for this,

541
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,120
and end up getting so exhausted.

542
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,980
And you don't even get a thank you.

543
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,010
We wouldn't need him tomorrow.

544
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,900
We will go back tomorrow.

545
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,860
In the afternoon,

546
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,960
I will call the man
from electricity company

547
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,380
to come fix the circuit.

548
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,570
So hurry?

549
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,410
Or else?

550
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,340
We can't keep staying over here.

551
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,700
Why not?

552
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,420
Isn't this pretty good?

553
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,420
I don't have an opinion.
I'm okay for anything.

554
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,610
Nan Xing,

555
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,700
go check later

556
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,220
about the recent movies.

557
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,660
There's a recent one,

558
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,650
a very good romance movie.

559
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,620
Would you like to watch it?

560
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,260
Sure.

561
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,370
Check the weekend,

562
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,320
and see if there is any suitable venue for us.

563
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,850
Alright.

564
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,340
I've checked completely on this side.

565
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,540
No issue found.

566
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,630
We'll check again outside.

567
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,140
Okay.

568
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,320
Then what has actually happened?

569
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,900
I couldn't find the issue.

570
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,060
What's actually causing

571
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,420
the power cut then?

572
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,990
I'm not sure either.

573
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,900
I've never encountered such situation.

574
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,780
If it still doesn't work,

575
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,780
I'll have to dismantle the circuit.

576
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,100
Dismantle the circuit?

577
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,060
Does that mean we have
to smash open the wall?

578
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,420
It's too troublesome.

579
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,020
There's no other way.

580
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,340
I leave you with no option.

581
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,300
You are to be without option.

582
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,300
It's quite late now, I'll have to go.

583
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,180
I'll be back tomorrow.

584
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,580
Okay.

585
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,700
Thank you.

586
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,780
How was it, Aunt Nan?

587
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,660
Xiong.

588
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,300
We still can't find out the cause.

589
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,430
The technician said

590
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,500
if it still doesn't work,

591
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,780
we'll have to smash the wall open

592
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,180
and rebuild the circuit.

593
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,280
That troublesome?

594
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,180
Mother.

595
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,580
You're back.

596
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,220
We're smashing the wall open?

597
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,750
We couldn't find the cause.

598
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,780
How about

599
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:52,740
I call the electricity company

600
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
tomorrow

601
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,340
and request

602
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,600
a new technician over?

603
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
If we're demolishing the wall,

604
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,340
how long would it take?

605
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,060
It's useless.

606
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,710
This issue could not be solved so quickly.

607
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,500
I know it.

608
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,020
Moreover,

609
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,060
isn't it fine

610
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,460
staying at my place?

611
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,060
You guys need not think too much.

612
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,580
Make yourselves at home.

613
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,540
That is our house.

614
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,980
That's right.

615
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,580
It's the same.

616
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,500
Let's eat.

617
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,340
Mother.

618
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,100
Which movie time slot do your prefer?

619
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,820
I'm buying the tickets.

620
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,170
I've watched that movie.

621
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:26,980
Don't buy it.

622
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Xiong helped me bought the tickets.

623
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,340
Here, I'll do it, Aunt Nan.

624
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:31,820
Okay.

625
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,140
You must watch it.

626
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,270
I'm sure you would like this movie.

627
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:37,910
Alright.

628
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,620
Let me check out

629
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,540
one last dish.

630
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,080
You helped my mother bought the tickets?

631
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,360
Today, I

632
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,280
wanted to try the digital wallet.

633
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,540
So I tested with buying
the tickets for Aunt Nan.

634
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,900
How did you get the internet money?

635
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,710
I used yours.

636
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,900
That's why I wonder

637
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,300
how is there a credit today.

638
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,460
I'll find Sisi then.

639
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,790
She watched it.

640
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,780
How about I watch it with you?

641
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,860
I haven't watched any movie

642
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,260
after I came here anyway.

643
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,180
You're not

644
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,740
plotting for something again, are you?

645
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,660
What am I plotting?

646
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,140
What can I get from

647
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,020
watching a movie with you?

648
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,980
I wanted to

649
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,620
ask you to watch with me too.

650
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,780
But I thought

651
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,580
you wouldn't like this kind of movie.

652
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,060
Never try never know.

653
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,140
Let's watch together then.

654
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260
How can I help you?

655
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,400
One set of popcorn.

656
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:37,860

[Writing novel?]

860
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,380
[If I could help her on this...]

861
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,700
Nan Xing,

862
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,220
do you think that

863
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,650
your brain is not that good?

864
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,100
Why do you say so?

865
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,100
Let me put it this way.

866
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,620
Do you think

867
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,910
that you're not that good in thinking?

868
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,730
Since you were young,

869
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,210
you've thought about a lot of things.

870
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,740
Did you achieve any of them?

871
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,900
Now that you know
thinking isn't your strength,

872
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,220
stop thinking too much then.

873
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,380
Just do it.

874
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,130
You have a point.

875
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,620
Good or bad,

876
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,860
it will only reveal
after I finish writing.

877
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,060
That's right.

878
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
I support you.

879
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,020
But I still don't know

880
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,380
what to write.

881
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,980
I told you you're not good in thinking.

882
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,820
It's true.

883
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
The topic is already

884
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,700
right in front of you.

885
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,260
What topic?

886
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,060
The things between us.

887
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,150
Aren't they worth writing?

888
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,100
[I want an]

889
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,750
[unforgettable love too.]

890
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,340
[What's going on?]

891
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,460
[Doesn't this scenario]

892
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,210
[only happen in novel?]

893
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,020
[Couldn't get my heart.]

894
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,610
[Getting me is still good right?]

895
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,020
No!

896
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,140
[Before you send me back,]

897
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,910
[I can only sleep with you]

898
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,220
[every single night.]

899
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,460
I...

900
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,020
Didn't I told you

901
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,260
not to bother me?

902
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,820
Put me down.

903
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,390
[That's right.]

904
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,100
[I could write such a story.]

905
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,380
You're right!

906
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,420
The story between us

907
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,500
is literally more novel than novel.

908
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,230
Alright, I'll write this then.

909
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
Xiao Wudi, you're amazing!

910
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,060
Fantastic!

911
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,920
I'll get back to write right away.

912
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,580
[Broken circuit trick]

913

[isn't a long term plan.]

914
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,100
[Even if we]

915
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,180
[don't stay together,]

916

[you will still need
to see me frequently.]

917
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,220
