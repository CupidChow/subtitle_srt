Is our company closing down?

He's staying here for the time being.

Why didn't you tell me then?

16

There are many people in the office.

It'll be terrible
if other people see this.

19
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,140
I have plenty of documents

20

that I need him to sign.

21

Excuse me.

You were responsible for handling

37

Right now,

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,890
he has to deal with everything.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,210
There are all kinds of contracts

40
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,460
on his desk.

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,740
He could not

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,940
handle that alone,

43
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,260
let alone writing novels.

44
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,810
He stopped publishing the current series

45
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,180
two weeks ago

46
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,710

Even so, he still produced nothing.

50
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,850
I guess he has to suspend the series.

51
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,800
I don't know what to do either.

55

and return to the company?

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,750
I've already asked him before.

57
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,180
He didn't want me to interfere.

58
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,950
In the past, you guys

59
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,950
used to think that he obeyed my will.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,660
Actually,

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,390
he always had his own ideas.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,290
And,

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,720
judging from our current relationship,

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,250
I don't think

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,740
he'll listen to me.

66

In the end,

67
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,470

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,590
â™« At the moment of waking up â™«

176
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,110
â™« I fear the loss of my heartbeat â™«

177
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,620
Let go of me.

178
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,210
â™« Let the snow be over the world â™«

179
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,560
â™« Try to show you
everything will be great â™«

180
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,890
You're so impolite.

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,870
â™« Don't fear â™«

182
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,300
Do you think you can hug me
whenever you feel like it?

183
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,340
â™« When I walk into darkness â™«

184
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,490
Tell me the truth.

185
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,380
â™« Please stay by my side â™«

186
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,100
Where am I?

187
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,930
Who are you?

188
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,440
â™« Wait for the waves to
take our sorrows away â™«

189
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,210
And, why am I

190
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,450
here?

191
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,730
Don't you recognize me?

192
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,140
â™« We all will be flowers â™«

193
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,580
Do I need to recognize you?

194
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,450
â™« No matter white or black â™«

195
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm Nan Xing!

196
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,260
â™« We'll be close together â™«

197
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm your girlfriend.

198
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,730
Let go of me.

199
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,040
â™« The light will never dim â™«

200
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,460
â™« We'll be close together â™«

201
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,440
â™« The light will never dim â™«

202
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,820
Xiao Wudi!

203
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,310
Where are you going?

204
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,900
I can go anywhere I like.

205
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,260
No one can stop me.

206
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,060
How could you forget about me?

207
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,810
I understand now.

208
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,430
You were captivated by

209
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,580
my beautiful looks.

210
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,140
Fine, I understand.

211
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,730
Everybody desires to look attractive.

212
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,550
However, I will

213
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,810
tell you this first.

214
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,090
If you keep following me,

215
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,980
don't blame me for beheading you.

216
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,170
You are Xiao Wudi!

217
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,900
Not only do I know your name,

218
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,320
but I also know that
you're Young Master Hehuan!

219
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,380
You're the number one villain
in the martial arts world.

220
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,460
You thought

221
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
you traveled through time

222
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,290
and came here from 500 years ago.

223
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,860
But in reality, you're just a character

224
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,260
in the novel I'd written!

225
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,250
You're the unforgettable relationship

226
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,860
that I had wished for!

227
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,660
You're my best friend.

228
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,220
You're the dearest person

229
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,500
to me

230
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,620
besides my mother.

231
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,580
You're the only person

232
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
who I had confessed to!

233
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,900
You're also the person

234
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,740
I had missed the most!

235
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,420
Such nonsense.

236
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,700
Stop following me!

237
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,610
Listen.

238
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,300
I don't understand what you're saying,

239
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,300
and I don't want

240
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,630
to understand them.

241
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,850
What's wrong?

242
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,930
Are you okay?

243
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,730
Are you hurt?

244
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,860
I'm fine.

245
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,750
Eat them while they're hot.

246
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,080
I'll clean up that area.

247
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,180
It's fine.

248
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,620
I'll hire someone to clean it tomorrow.

249
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,130
Anyway,

250
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm living with my parents right now.

251
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,240
My house is vacant.

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,050
Why don't you move into my house?

253
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,940
It's fine.

254
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,050
I'm staying here

255
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,770
so that I could work more conveniently.

256
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,900
It's not that I don't have a place to go.

257
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,740
And, I've been handling
the company's affairs

258
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,340
pretty well lately.

259
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,090
Don't worry about it.

260
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,210
Eat up.

261
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,210
You...

262
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
How have you been doing?

263
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,530
Pretty good.

264
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,530
I no longer

265
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,660
need to answer calls

266
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,260
or read documents.

267
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,700
I have plenty of free time now.

268
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,730
But I couldn't get used to it.

269
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,930
That's pretty good.

270
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,700
You have time

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,300
to do the things you like.

272
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,730
You don't need to worry about
the company too much.

273
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,280
You should head back and rest.

274
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,940
Take good care of yourself then.

275
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,390
[Will you still]

276
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,730
[agree to it even if your relationship]

277
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,340
[will end terribly?]

278
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,970
[By then, you'll have to suffer]

279
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,220
[all by yourself.]

280
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,660
Let go of me.

281
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,420
Don't you recognize me?

282
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,820
I'm Nan Xing.

283
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,250
I'm your girlfriend.

284
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,700
You're my best friend.

285
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,260
You're the dearest person

286
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,410
to me

287
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,530
besides my mother.

288
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,360
You're the only person

289
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,500
who I had confessed to!

290
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,080
You're also the person

291
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,650
I had missed the most.

292
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,500
Such nonsense.

293
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,530
[You won't lose]

294
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,820
[your beloved again]

295
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,250
[if I stay away from you]

296
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,690
[this time.]

297
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,700
Say,

298
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,140
what exactly is wrong with him?

299
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,060
This can't be.

300
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,860
Is that actually the case?`

301
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,620
I know now.

302
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,990
Good night.

303
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,580
Why hasn't she returned yet?

304
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
Don't tell me she's in danger?

305
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,330
She's back.

306
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,860
Even if I want you to be happy,

307
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,870
you don't need to be that happy
without me.

308
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,650
Even if you do believe

309
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,190
that I've lost my memories,

310
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,190
you can't just ignore me like this.

311
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,700
At the very least,

312
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I was once your boyfriend, you know?

313
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,870
To think that I was actually disheartened
about her call for help.

314
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,800
Xiao Wudi, help.

315
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,260
Come back immediately.

316
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,060
What's going on?

317
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,820
Why am I here?

318
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,330
Do you

319
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,660
cast a spell on me?

320
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,890
Although you don't remember anything,

321
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,730
this is

322
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,140
our relationship.

323
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,860
As long as I beckon you,

324
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,900
you have to appear in front of me.

325
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,140
Come.

326
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,710
Take off your shirt.

327
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,740
What are you saying?

328
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,580
Aren't you hot from
wearing that many layers?

329
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,380
You smell rotten.

330
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,440
You should take a bath while you're at it.

331
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,690
Don't touch me!

332
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,860
Who are you?

333
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,300
Do I know you?

334
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

335
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,320
I'm your girlfriend.

336
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,060
You were summoned by me.

337
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
You have to do everything

338
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,820
I tell you to do.

339
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,680
If not,

340
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,030
you will suffer from a headache.

341
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,860
Understood?

342
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,150
I don't understand.

343
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,230
Xiao Wudi, help.

344
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,050
Go and take a bath.

345
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,800
Xiao Wudi, help.

346
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,780
Go and take a bath.

347
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,260
Xiao Wudi, help.

348
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,660
The bathroom is over there.

349
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,250
Please.

350
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,860
You have no decency at all.

351
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,050
From what I can remember,

352
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,780
Young Master Xiao, you weren't someone

353
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,580
who was bound by codes of ethics.

354
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,700
Xiao Wudi, help.

355
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,090
Go and take a bath.

356
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,540
Stop acting tough.

357
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,790
I was just teasing you.

358
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,890
Go now.

359
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,460
I even scrubbed the bathtub for you.

360
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,330
She must be out of her mind.

361
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,020
I guess I won't be able

362
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,970
to see all of this again

363
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,330
once I return.

364
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,440
I can't even see her again.

365
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,180
Why am I missing all of this?

366
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,820
What are you up to again?

367
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,890
I got you some clothes.

368
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,550
Your clothes are dirty.

369
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,970
You can wear these later.

370
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,350
This shirt looks terrible.

371
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,150
Don't you have any other shirts?

372
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,240
The rest of them

373
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,650
belongs to my boyfriend.

374
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,850
Are you my boyfriend?

375
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
Xiao Wudi!

376
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,660
Have you truly forgotten about me?

377
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
That's right.

378
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,720
I already told you before.

379
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,580
It's possible that
you might have been rebooted.

380
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,900
What do you mean by that?

381
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,420
It's just like resetting a smartphone.

382
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,810
You've been reset.

383
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,200
You forgot about me

384
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,530
because your data was wiped away.

385
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,900
You'll remember me

386
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,760
once I restore your data.

387
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,890
I don't understand.

388
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,780
Come here.

389
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,300
Why should I?

390
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,410
Help...

391
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,820
[Handsome Chinese Boy]

392
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,370
You can sleep here tonight.

393
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,540
This is inappropriate.

394
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,510
Why is this inappropriate?

395
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,620
I won't treat you as my boyfriend.

396
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,600
Even so,

397
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,140
you have no place to stay tonight.

398
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,200
Why must you put yourself on the spot?

399
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,300
Miss,

400
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,300
you are a kind person.

401
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,370
I suggest you

402
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,780
forget about that boyfriend
of yours as soon as possible

403
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,740
and start a new life.

404
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,900
You!

405
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,260
Nan Xing?

406
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,090
Boss, you're here?

407
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,230
What does this mean?

408
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,420
She told me to live here
for a couple of days.

409
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,100
Boss,

410
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,800
I was handling

411
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,780
some personal affairs just now.

412
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,020
I didn't leave you alone

413
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,830
on purpose.

414
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,800
It's fine. I've handled everything.

416
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,060
Was Miss Ye here?

417
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,140
Although

418
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know

419
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,730
what happened between you two,

420
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,260
I think she's pretty concerned about you.

421
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,050
Why don't you recruit her again?

422
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,420
You won't be under that much pressure

423
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,900
if she's helping you out.

424
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,090
She and I have known each other
for a long time.

425
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,270
She has always been

426
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,800
solving my problems for me.

427
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,830
Now, she finally has the time

428
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,690
to take a break.

429
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,550
I don't wish to interrupt her.

430
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,180
Alright then.

431
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,920
I'll clean up

432
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,020
that area for you.

433
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,800
No need for that.

434
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,370
You should head back and rest.

435
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,830
Where will you sleep then?

436
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,790
I'll sleep on the sofa.

437
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,890
On the sofa? But...

438
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,350
I'll think of something tomorrow.

439
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,690
Boss,

440
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
let me bring your luggage inside.

441
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,860
Come in.

442
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,710
I thought you were leaving.

443
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,460
Go ahead.

444
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,270
I have no place to stay tonight.

445
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,650
Why must I

446
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,910
put myself on the spot?

447
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,030
I'll stay in this room then.

448
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,930
No.

449
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,940
So, you aren't leaving?

450
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,340
Boss,

451
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,630
give me a moment.

452
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,770
I need to speak to him.

453
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,080
Come in.

454
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,880
Enough already. Stop pretending.

455
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Aren't you tired?

456
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,980
Who's pretending?

457
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,100
What do you mean by pretending?

458
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,870
You were pretending
to have lost your memories.

459
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,650
This trope

460
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,420
is outdated.

461
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,950
Everyone is tired of it.

462
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,580
I didn't pretend to lose my memories.

463
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,770
You didn't, huh?

464
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,590
I never saw a person from the ancient era

465
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,250
who knew they have to wait
for the traffic light.

466
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,390
You don't

467
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,650
look adorable at all.

468
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,130
What do you mean?

469
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,260
Why didn't you tell me

470
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,230
when you knew about it all along?

471
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,170
I made a fool out of myself.

472
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,390
It's all because

473
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,700
I wanted to give you a way out.

474
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,850
I never expected you to keep acting.

475
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,180
You did grow smarter.

476
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,700
However, dumber you

477
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,740
was better.

478
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,580
What do you want then?

479
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,240
Do you want to break up with me?

480
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,620
Sure. I'll gladly oblige.

481
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,340
What are you laughing at?

482
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,790
How could you laugh

483
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,620
when I'm sad?

484
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,740
What are you sad about?

485
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,420
You pretended

486
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,080
to lose your memories.

487
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,100
What exactly were you up to?

488
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,810
[Pretty good.]

489
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,670
I no longer

490
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,990
need to answer calls

491
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,620
or read documents.

492
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,300
You don't need to worry too much
about the company.

493
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,040
So,

494
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,570
if that fairy wasn't lying,

495
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,150
I would only be able

496
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,940
to stay here for a short time.

497
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,640
I guess

498
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,540
I have to return

499
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,930
to the novel's world

500
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,660
once I completed my mission.

501
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,750
By then,

502
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,340
we have to part ways again.

503
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,180
You were trapped

504
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,500
in a fire back then.

505
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,210
I don't want you

506
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,340
to go through the same thing again.

507
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,190
Was that why you pretended
to lose your memories?

508
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,330
Even so,

509
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,250
it cannot resolve our issue.

510
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,660
I know that.

511
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,340
However,

512
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,620
I didn't know how to
break the news to you.

513
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,580
when I saw you again.

514
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,500
My brain couldn't function.

515
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,230
Your brain couldn't function?

516
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,570
I thought you were intelligent?

517
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,180
Caring too much about someone
will cause one to panic.

518
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,980
You're the jinx of my life.

519
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,620
Fine.

520
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,020
You can blame it on me.

521
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm very grateful

522
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,270
that you considered my feelings.

523
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,740
But sometimes, we only learn our lessons

524
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,820
after losing something.

525
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,380
What have you learned then?

526
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,530
I said this before.

527
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,340
If I miss out on the present,

528
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,550
I will surely regret it

529
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,610
no matter what happens in the future.

530
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,160
Back then,

531
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,020
I was already mentally prepared.

532
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,270
I don't care about the ending.

533
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,100
I just want us to be together right now.

534
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,340
But it was just a guess back then.

535
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,460
Now, the ending has been confirmed.

536
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,660
How could you be sure

537
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,250
that I couldn't stand it?

538
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,020
Don't be so pessimistic.

539
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,820
Even if

540
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,820
your prediction does come true,

541
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,820
I believe that I can deal with it.

542
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,230
But...

543
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,900
Xiao Wudi,

544
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,040
you're a martial artist.

545
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,740
You should be cool about it.

546
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,340
That's what I wanted to do too.

547
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,470
But I can't just

548
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,040
act cool about losing you.

549
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,580
You're my first love.

550
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,850
Is that so?

551
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,290
Really?

552
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,660
I...

553
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,440
I was just saying that

554
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,090
in order to please you.

555
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,190
You're so easy to trick.

556
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,660
So, do you feel better now?

557
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,820
It's all because of you.

558
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,990
I was doing great

559
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,300
in my world.

560
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,620
You were

561
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,660
a villain anyway.

562
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,010
Why is he still here?

563
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,770
Boss, what's the matter?

564
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,139
It's getting late.

565
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,179
So?

566
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,659
I need to rush my manuscript tomorrow.

567
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,449
So?

568
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,710
It's time to sleep.

569
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,570
You should head home then.

570
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,940
I understand now.

571
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,580
I'll deal with the situation.

572
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,440
How could a boss

573
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,420
stay in his subordinate's house?

574
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,239
The situation is quite complicated.

575
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,810
I'll explain it to you later.

576
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,330
Boss, it's fine.

577
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,159
Follow me.

578
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,219
I'll bring your luggage to your room.

579
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,260
Boss,

580
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,620
although these sheets

581
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,110
aren't new,

582
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,010
I've washed and dried them.

583
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,889
They're clean.

584
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,260
You can sleep on them for now.

585
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,100
I'll buy new ones

586
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,989
for you tomorrow.

587
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,679
Both of you

588
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,480
can stay here for the time being.

589
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,340
Xiao Wudi is familiar
with the layout of the house.

590
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,130
You can ask him

591
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,590
if you have any questions.

592
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,900
I didn't even complain about it.

593
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,610
What's with the long face?

594
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,080
I'm just not used to

595
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,040
hearing footsteps

596
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,940
in the house.

597
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,960
I might suffer from insomnia

598
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,760
if I hear footsteps in the house.

599
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,840
This isn't your house.

600
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,330
It's Nan Xing's house.

601
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,340
I think I should return to the company.

602
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,660
But there was a fire just now.

603
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,780
You should stay here.

604
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,230
He can't even afford

605
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,810
a hotel room now.

606
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,210
You should go easy on him.

607
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,620
Did he lose all of his fortunes
in just a few days

608
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,300
after I returned to my period?

609
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,250
That's not it.

610
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,850
I'll explain it to you later.

611
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,930
Boss, you should rest.

612
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,430
We'll make a move first.

613
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,270
I'm living in the opposite house.

614
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,760
Text me

615
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,700
if you need anything.

616
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,360
Rest early.

617
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,220
I overheard your conversation

618
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,610
and heard something about

619
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,250
fairies and memory loss.

620
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,680
Were you guys talking about a novel plot?

621
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,340
Yeah.

622
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,900
Isn't the male lead

623
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,980
too absurd then?

624
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,280
What did you say?

625
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,160
It was just a discussion.

626
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,820
We don't plan on writing that.

627
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,450
See you. Goodbye.

628
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,740
Rest well, okay?

629
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,820
Good night.

630
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,680
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

631
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,180
It's been a long time since I saw you.

632
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
Can't I take a longer look at you?

633
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,370
Sure, you can.

634
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,820
One,

635
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,450
two,

636
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,200
three,

637
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,730
four,

638
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,540
five seconds.

639
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,220
Is that long enough for you?

640
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,500
Nope.

641
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,740
It's not long enough?

642
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,370
You can continue by tomorrow then.

643
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,030
Good night.

644
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,120
Aren't you afraid

645
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,890
that I might be recalled
to my world out of the blue?

646
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,460
You won't be recalled

647
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,710
before your mission is completed.

648
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,200
Good night.

649
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,590
Good night.

650
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,060
What are you doing here?

651
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,660
I came in through the window.

652
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,430
It isn't my first time doing it anyway.

653
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,660
It isn't your first time?

654
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,410
â™« Waiting for someone's expectation â™«

655
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,280
Have you done this many times?

656
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,930
â™« I guess right now
your heart flutters too â™«

657
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,140
Go back to your room.

658
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,770
â™« Still uneasy as we inch closer â™«

659
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,700
No, I won't.

660
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,490
That Lu Zichen

661
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,230
â™« This scenario is not what I expected â™«

662
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,930
is such a loud snorer. I can't sleep.

663
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,360
You two

664
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,220
aren't sleeping in the same room.

665
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,820
His room is next to yours.

666
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,140
The soundproofing is terrible.

667
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,160
It doesn't matter how far away
his room is.

668
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,080
â™« Waiting to make a wish â™«

669
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,700
You'll catch a cold
if you sleep like this.

670
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,730
â™« I guess right now you're willing too â™«

671
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,610
Be a good boy.

672
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,230
â™« Everyday with more
getting used to and reliance â™«

673
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,710
Let me stay here for one night.

674
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,720
â™« I hear heartbeats racing â™«

675
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,820
The sun hasn't risen yet.

676
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,530
Just go to sleep.

677
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,290
â™« Tell me why â™«

678
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,820
Don't worry.

679
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,370
I'll surely vanish before

680
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,530
â™« You are always by my side â™«

681
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,740
Aunt An enters your room
tomorrow morning.

682
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,850
â™« Maybe this is destiny â™«

683
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,670
â™« When I look into your eyes â™«

684
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,050
â™« The radiance
transcending time and space â™«

685
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,070
â™« Is love â™«

686
