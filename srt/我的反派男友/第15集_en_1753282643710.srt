1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Newadaama

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,760
I just want her to be with me more.

3
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,560
Why am I getting more and more excited?

4
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,880
Do I really want to be her boyfriend?

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,160
He's just in love once,

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
but he's always been rejected.

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
He's in love for the first time?

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,520
I'm still single for him.

9
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
He failed in love for the first time,

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
so he's single.

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,520
Then is he a man?

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,280
No.

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
He's a man.

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
He's a man.

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
He's a man.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
He's a man.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
Then who is he in love with?

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Who else?

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,720
Nanxing has been bold and warm-hearted

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,280
since he was a kid.

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,480
Our boy is smart.

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,120
He likes to pretend to be cool.

23
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,720
They always fight over this.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,480
Nanxing, it's okay.

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,040
You'll accidentally bump into him later.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
And then you'll naturally

27
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
fight with him.

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
What a coincidence.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
What a coincidence.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
What a coincidence.

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Why are you here?

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm wearing headphones,

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
not an eye mask.

34
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,600
Can't I see you

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
chasing me from the bus stop?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,240
Who's chasing you?

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Who's chasing you?

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,200
I was...

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
practicing.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Say it again.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Don't pretend to know me

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
at school.

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Don't talk to me.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,480
I didn't pretend to know you.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
I knew you.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,320
If you don't know me,

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,720
why did you give me your homework?

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,760
I have principles.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,560
I don't copy strangers' homework.

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,320
That's your homework.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,040
It's okay.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Why are you...

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,280
Look at you.

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Third grandson.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Good boy.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Xiaojun, open the door.

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,640
Bai Xiaoqing, the door is not locked.

58
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I came in by myself.

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Nanxing,

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm here to see you.

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Nanxing,

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm here to ask Mao Xiaojun

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
about math.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
Xiaojun,

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
tell him.

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,280
He will tell me.

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Tell me.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
Are you asking for homework

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
or looking for a pen?

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
I get hit by you every day.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
I'm even dizzy.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
You can start from the first question.

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Okay.

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
You'll be in a bad mood tomorrow.

75
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
Please.

76
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Tell me.

77
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I can tell you.

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
But,

79
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
you have to stay for dinner.

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
Mom, is there any Nanxing's dinner?

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You have to tell me late.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
Yes, of course.

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,760
I even added a dish for you.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,560
Study hard.

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Dinner is ready.

86
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,720
Actually, I've learned enough.

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I can go back now.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't cheat.

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,600
Mom,

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
it's specific to your plans.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,360
Okay.

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
rooms.

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
Section 5A is waiting.

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,640
Yes.

95
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,400
Reading trial class.

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Don't go back.

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,080
Scene 1,

98
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm just leaving.

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,160
Lu Yining will come to see you.

100
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Men.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,720
She doesn't like him.

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
is even more abnormal.

103
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,200
After the fire,

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,160
Nan Xin got a panic disorder

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,760
and didn't like anyone else.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
She only had one relationship

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
during her youth

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
and she failed.

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,200
If she wrote the emotional line,

110
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,280
what kind of inspiration would she have?

111
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,320
municipal braking

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
How can she have any emotional energy?

113
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,280
There is only one love

114
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,560
and was always rejected.

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
This year is the 50th anniversary

116
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
of our school's 50th anniversary.

117
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,720
At this moment,

118
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,240
I believe that you must have a lot to share.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,360
Can you send a blessing

120
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
to our school

121
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,280
on behalf of our great alumni?

122
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,240
Okay, please.

123
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Thank you.

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,480
I am very grateful to all teachers and alumni

125
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,200
for giving me this opportunity to stand here

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,720
to send my best alumni

127
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,040
a blessing for our school.

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,560
Sujiang Middle School is a special place for me.

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
Because what matters here

130
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,480
is not only the score of the college entrance exam.

131
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,960
It encourages us to have dreams

132
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
and to strive for them.

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
Many years ago,

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
my partner and I

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,960
started from here

136
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,920
because we had a small dream.

137
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,240
We went to the university and the world.

138
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,360
So, in the coming days,

139
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,840
X Culture

140
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,960
will continue to be grateful

141
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
and create glory

142
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
with the same heart and virtue as the school.

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Okay, finally,

144
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,040
we will invite the principal to come to the stage again.

145
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,000
She is so beautiful.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,680
And her twin daughter is so cute.

147
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
I want a twin daughter too.

148
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,160
She is so cute.

149
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
You go first.

150
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
I want to go to the equipment room.

151
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
Okay, bye.

152
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,280
Bye.

153
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,880
Bye.

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:42,800
0 boyfriend

155
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,280
in office

156
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
You have something to say to me.

158
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
I...

159
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Why are you so careless?

160
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Mao Xiaojun,

161
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
do you know that

162
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,280
I have someone I like again?

163
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,160
I have someone I like again.

164
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,520
But I don't dare to tell him.

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
I'm afraid that I'm not good enough.

166
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm afraid that he will dislike me.

167
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,800
Why are you here?

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Your mom asked me to bring you something.

169
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,120
How do you know I'm here?

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,840
I've never disliked you being stupid.

171
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
What?

172
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,360
I don't know how to put it.

173
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,560
I've never disliked you being stupid.

174
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,760
Of course, I've never been stupid.

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
But at least not now.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,760
And what's wrong with being stupid?

177
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,520
Not everyone is that smart.

178
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
I've delivered the stuff.

179
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,440
Then you should be careful.

180
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm leaving.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,800
Nanxing, be brave.

182
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
Don't miss this chance again.

183
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Xiao Xiao!

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,760
Let's go to the contest together.

185
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,440
It's not funny, we're free finished.

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,740
Alone in the forest

187
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,800
Theresa's 1938

188
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,960
했어 d Keys

189
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,760
piston

190
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,800
It's such a good trip.

191
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Come with me and watch us.

192
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,000
You can't just push away our vacation in a moment.

193
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,280
Let me tell them

194
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,720
Ok

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Little brother, good job

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,920
Zichen, see you later

197
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,760
See you later

198
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,960
Who are they?

199
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
They are all our senior and senior

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,160
You've seen them before

201
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,560
Then why do they praise me?

202
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
Didn't you say you remembered?

203
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,160
Ye Qing

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,560
Principal

205
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,480
Zichen is here too

206
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
Aren't you busy with work?

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,840
I just came to see

208
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,600
Zichen

209
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,760
I have to thank you on behalf of the school

210
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
You've done a great favor

211
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,360
Take this repair

212
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Old library

213
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
If it weren't for the X-Culture

214
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
Open the box

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
How can we

216
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,040
Solved the money so quickly

217
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,520
Yes

218
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,640
Principal Zhao

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
Don't praise him anymore

220
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,520
Praise Yi Bo more

221
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,280
Go up to the sky

222
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,880
President Lu, this is the fact

223
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Although our school

224
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
Although our school

225
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,480
Cultivated a lot of social people

226
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,680
But like Zichen

227
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,920
Not only to return to society

228
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,940
Not many people can help the

229
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,600
There are not many people

230
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,960
Our school is not short of money

231
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,560
But like him

232
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,720
People who can do things

233
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,880
If it weren't for Zichen

234
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
Send Ye Qing to help

235
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
How can we be so smooth

236
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,920
So much love to help

237
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,240
Come home and help me

238
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm old

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
To retire

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,160
This X-Culture

241
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,640
Isn't it you who participated in the investment?

242
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,560
You are talking about a family

243
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,560
I hope so

244
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
President Lu, let's go have tea

245
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay, please

246
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,800
Okay, it's not the first time

247
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
If he doesn't like it

248
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,480
What we do

249
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
Then why did he invest

250
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,560
Isn't your dad like that?

251
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,520
No matter what

252
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,560
He is also your dad

253
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Thank you

254
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,400
Do me so much

255
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,040
I used to think that as long as I donate

256
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
I didn't expect so much

257
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,920
Need to cooperate

258
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,960
The two of us are always different

259
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
I did what I was good at

260
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,640
You can do what you are good at

261
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
You always say that

262
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,440
Actually i know

263
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,120
You are just sharing the pressure for me

264
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Especially when facing my dad

265
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,520
what happened

266
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,360
Did I say something wrong?

267
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,480
No

268
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
Just i hope

269
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,560
Things outside of work in the future

270
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,160
Think about it when you make decisions

271
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Some things are not for me to handle

272
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,680
For example

273
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,600
Senior

274
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,320
My girlfriend is your fan

275
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,240
Super like you

276
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
Can we take a picture together?

277
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,360
Yes

278
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,200
Then we can go

279
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,720
Take a picture in front of the venue, senior

280
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,680
it is good

281
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,360
Thank you, senior

282
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,120
Thank you, senior

283
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,960
Go

284
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,240
You said our school

285
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,080
Is it a school branch?

286
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
Yes, it's done very well

287
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,280
When will you take me to see

288
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,040
OK, OK, OK

289
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,840
They have paid attention

290
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
I have already given you the answer

291
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,280
Why are you here again?

292
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
This is a business plan I made when I went back

293
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,720
I think if you have more understanding of this industry

294
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,080
Should change your mind

295
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,600
It's no use for my son to come

296
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,760
What do you think

297
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,320
I can vote for you

298
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,160
Just by this

299
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,680
Zichen's original novel

300
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Already gathered a large number of first-generation fans

301
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,320
The latter can be changed according to IP

302
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,680
And I believe in the next three years

303
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,800
Cultural IP industry will definitely explode

304
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,840
Uncle, you know this in your heart

305
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
Do you think I will agree?

306
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,760
Uncle, that's because

307
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
You don't believe your son

308
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
last time

309
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,360
You said he was too naive

310
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,560
I do not deny this

311
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,640
But I think it's because of this feature

312
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,480
Is the most precious thing of a creator

313
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,840
Future days

314
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
I will walk with him

315
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,600
I will take all the risks

316
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,440
I hope you think about it seriously

317
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,560
Then why do you have to vote for me?

318
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,280
Have you talked to other investors?

319
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,800
Because I think

320
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,920
You can give each other a chance

321
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,840
My son gave me a chance

322
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,440
Is it important

323
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
Don't you always want him

324
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
To inherit your company?

325
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,840
But if you force this thing

326
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
With his heart

327
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,120
Do you think he will be willing

328
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
Will this company be managed well?

329
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
What can you get?

330
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,040
He planned that dream

331
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
It's also my dream

332
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,000
This is for me

333
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,320
OK

334
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,560
I threw this project

335
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
But don't be too happy

336
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
I have a condition

337
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
You can't be with Lu Zi Chen

338
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
to invest in the company.

339
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,760
Is that okay?

340
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
I promise you.

341
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,280
I have a condition, too.

342
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,680
Please tell me.

343
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,040
Don't tell him that I'm here today.

344
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,640
Okay.

345
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,240
Okay.

346
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,680
Yang Xi.

347
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,040
What time is it? Why don't you turn off the lights and go to sleep?

348
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,560
I'll sleep later.

349
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
What are you doing?

350
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,880
Take off your clothes and take a look.

351
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
Are you going out?

352
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,760
I'm going to a competition.

353
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,240
Isn't the competition next week?

354
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,480
Yes.

355
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,360
Am I a little too anxious?

356
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,080
Yes.

357
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,120
You have to dress up for the competition.

358
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
Let me see.

359
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,400
This doesn't work.

360
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
The jeans are too casual.

361
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,960
You are a writer now.

362
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,200
You have to wear a little bit of a texture.

363
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,120
You can't wear this one.

364
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,480
This guy's clothes are too neutral.

365
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
No, no, no.

366
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,560
What about this one?

367
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,200
It's okay.

368
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,080
It's okay. You have to wear a dress.

369
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,280
Let me see.

370
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,120
And your hair.

371
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,000
What's wrong with my hair?

372
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,240
Hair is the second face of a person.

373
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
It's very important.

374
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,440
This...

375
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,760
Is it usually like this?

376
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,720
There must be a lot of boys going to the competition.

377
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
Even kids go.

378
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,320
Why does it feel different from usual?

379
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,000
What about this?

380
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,000
Is it pretty?

381
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,880
It's cute.

382
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
Anyway, there are still a few days left until the competition.

383
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,880
Let's go buy some pretty dresses.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
Don't lose, okay?

385
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,840
Okay.

386
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,000
Then you should rest early.

387
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,800
Okay.

388
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,840
Good night.

389
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,800
This is the ancient town I'm going to visit.

390
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,680
The place where love is born.

391
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Love.

392
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,000
Nan Xing, I like you.

393
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,960
Be my girlfriend.

394
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Do I have to say this to her?

395
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,320
I'm fine as long as I don't see Ming Huo when I'm nervous.

397
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
For example, don't blow the candles on your birthday.

398
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,080
Don't watch fireworks.

399
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,760
No.

400
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,320
I can't confess when I'm performing on fire.

401
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
What if she gets sick?

402
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,760
Xiaodi.

403
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
I like you.

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,680
Be my boyfriend.

405
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,840
Do I have to say this to her?

406
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,240
I will plan it well.

407
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,680
Give you a perfect confession.

408
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,680
Okay.

409
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,840
Xiaodi.

410
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Xiaodi.

411
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,480
Why aren't you home?

412
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,960
Where did you go?

413
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,400
I bought you breakfast.

414
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,640
It's hanging on your door.

415
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,840
Remember to eat it.

416
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
Why isn't it Tagen has sent her food yet?

417
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,440
What is he doing in such an non- jijung living room?

418
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,880
The breakthrough.

419
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,640
The second senate is in charge of prioritizing her health.

420
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,560
Have you had a rest?

421
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,080
Not yet.

422
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,000
What about you?

423
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,080
Not yet.

424
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,880
Get up at 6 a.m. tomorrow.

425
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,920
I've made the time.

426
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,520
Good night.

427
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,400
See you tomorrow.

428
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,040
See you tomorrow.

429
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,080
Where left

430
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,720
Accidentally caught

431
00:23:50,920 --> 00:24:13,580
Happy

432
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,520
Littlelively!

433
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,440
Here.

434
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,720
Lu Ruikin.

435
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,480
Put away your luggage, please. Thank you.

436
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,440
Chen Qian.

437
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,600
Put your luggage away and get in.

438
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,400
Mr Nan.

439
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
Gao Yangxi.

440
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,920
You're wearing a dress.

441
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,280
Don't move.

442
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,920
Zhao Jie.

443
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,720
What's wrong?

444
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,760
What do you want me to do?

445
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,040
I just want to say hello to you.

446
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
Don't be so nervous.

447
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,920
You are the writer

448
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,320
we want to focus on today.

449
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,640
Relax.

450
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,760
Handsome guy.

451
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,080
You are here too.

452
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,320
Do you remember me?

453
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,440
Of course I remember you.

454
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,560
Zhao Jie.

455
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,840
Last time, I had a lunch with a man in the corner.

456
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,840
I didn't even ask you to settle the score.

457
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,240
Handsome guy, you are handsome.

458
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm good at remembering.

459
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,320
You are good at remembering.

460
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,520
But you are also good at taking revenge.

461
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,680
He doesn't know how to talk.

462
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,240
Let's put our luggage in.

463
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
See you later, handsome guy.

464
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,520
Mr. Ye.

465
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,680
How is it? Are you here?

466
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,520
Yes.

467
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,480
Mr. Ye.

468
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,920
Let's go.

469
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,680
Are you ready?

470
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,640
Let's go.

471
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,400
Let me help you put your luggage in.

472
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,840
Okay.

473
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,240
Hello.

474
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,120
You are here too.

475
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,320
Mr. Ye.

476
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
Mr. Ye, why isn't the boss here?

477
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,920
He never participates in these activities.

478
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,560
He is here.

479
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,720
Boss.

480
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,120
Boss.

481
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,840
Boss.

482
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,880
Boss.

483
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,200
Why are you here?

484
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,040
I'm here with you.

485
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,120
Let's go.

486
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,960
Boss, please.

487
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,120
Let's go.

488
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
Why didn't you call me in advance

489
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,760
so that we could have a psychological preparation?

490
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,520
What psychological preparation do we need?

491
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,040
Don't you dislike

492
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,240
interacting with strangers?

493
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,120
Digging new authors

494
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,880
is the most important thing to us.

495
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,880
Okay.

496
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,840
You can talk to everyone

497
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
for the next few days.

498
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,040
Wait a minute.

499
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
This is Xiaochu.

500
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,280
You and Mr. Shi share a room.

501
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,760
Okay.

502
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,520
Yufan.

503
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,760
You and Qianqian share a room.

504
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,040
Okay.

505
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Take the keys.

506
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,920
Nanxiu.

507
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,520
You and I share a room.

508
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,600
Okay.

509
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Well, boss.

510
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm really sorry.

511
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
Our homestay has limited rooms.

512
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,240
So you may have to share a room with Xiao Wu Di.

513
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,400
You may have to share a room with Xiao Wu Di.

514
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,280
I can go to the hotel

515
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,080
and find a hotel.

516
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,200
Yes.

517
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,240
It's okay.

518
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,120
Okay.

519
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,760
I'll help you find a hotel nearby.

520
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,080
Hey.

521
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Don't bother.

522
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,920
You need to remember your identity.

523
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,320
You're a writer, not an assistant.

524
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,800
Don't think of Mr. Lu as a shallow person.

525
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,480
He's not a three-year-old kid.

526
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,920
You can do a lot of things yourself.

527
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,480
Right?

528
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,920
I can do it myself.

529
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,480
It's okay.

530
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,200
It's not a problem.

531
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,920
I'll help you find a hotel.

532
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,320
You can share a room with Xiao Wu Di.

533
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,960
Anyway, we're going to cooperate.

534
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
Get familiar with each other first.

535
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,120
I can.

536
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
Guys,

537
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,960
our rooms are all divided.

538
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,280
Let's go back to our rooms and put things in.

539
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,000
Later, we'll gather at the gate of the ancient town

540
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,520
and have lunch together.

541
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Let's go to the ancient town in the afternoon.

542
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,320
Applause.

543
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,200
Okay.

544
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,720
Okay.

545
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,560
Everyone, get out of here.

546
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,280
Go put things in.

547
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,720
Go.

548
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,480
See you later.

549
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,880
fingerprints

550
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,200
Who told you not to say hello before coming?

551
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,080
Enjoy the results.

552
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
Let's go look for a room.

553
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
Go, go, go.

554
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,920
Go, go, go.

555
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,320
Yes.

556
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,440
What are you doing?

557
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,400
We're waiting for our boss.

558
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,920
Boss

559
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,480
Boss

560
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,120
Boss is here

561
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
We can go for a walk

562
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Ok

563
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,640
Ok, bye

564
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,680
Bye

565
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,680
Are you sure you don't rest in the room

566
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,760
Stay with him

567
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,960
I

568
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm with you

569
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
You are not blind

570
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,600
I know a shop

571
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,800
It's a century-old shop

572
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,520
It sells cold noodles

573
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,600
Do you want to try it

574
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,240
Ok

575
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,840
It's just before lunch

576
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,280
How is it

577
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
It's so delicious

578
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,080
I told you

579
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,520
How do you know this shop

580
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,320
This

581
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,600
I saw the strategy on the Internet before

582
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
I want another bowl

583
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,760
You still eat

584
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
You won't eat later

585
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,200
Ok

586
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,080
Boss

587
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,360
Another bowl

588
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,080
Ok

589
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,200
This bowl

590
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,800
Ok

591
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,440
I'll give you a bowl first

592
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,440
Bye

593
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,040
Thank you

594
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,560
You today

595
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,480
You are here

596
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,240
Dai Xi

597
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
Hi, handsome

598
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,800

599
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Ice powder

600
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,720
I want to eat too

601
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
I'll treat you

602
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,720

00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,800
Give me more osmanthus

604
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,360
Ok

605
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,680
That boss

606
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,920
Come to my house

607
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,680
Ok

608
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,400

609
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,040
Dai Xi

610
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,120
Teacher Shi

611
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,240
What flavor do you want

612
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,720
This is the one

613
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,320
Double

614
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,600
It's an ice cream

615
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,240
Ok

616
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,600
Boss

617
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,720
Hello

618
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,360

That one

622
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
Ice cream

623
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,760
Boss

624
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,400
Very cold

625
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
That's smth

626
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,480
Come on

627
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Very delicious

628
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,840
did you happen to eat

629
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,600
I ordered it

630
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,920
Come to eat

631
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,640
Do you dig

632
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,320
Who did that?

633
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,080
There is so much fun stuff here.

634
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,880
Raw sugar?

635
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,520
This is amazing.

636
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,040
Look.

637
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,160
You can shave here.

638
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,160
What do you think?

639
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,680
Make it larger.

640
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,440
I can do it.

641
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,960
Let's go.

642
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,560
I'll teach you.

643
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,320
Come on.

644
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,920
This way.

645
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,600
What are you going to do?

646
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm going to do

647
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,160
a Paris Tower.

648
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,160
You're going to do it for the first time

649
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,320
and it's so difficult.

650
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
You're not going to do it.

651
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,680
You'll break it.

652
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,960
Look.

653
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,000
Look.

654
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,920
Add some water.

655
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,280
It's a little dry.

656
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,760
You have to start from the bottom

657
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
and use the middle.

658
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,320
Is it enough?

659
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,040
Okay.

660
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,800
Almost done.

661
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,880
Okay.

662
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,600
Did you step on the switch?

663
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,280
Slow down.

664
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,480
You're so good.

665
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,240
I'm not.

666
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,880
I'm not.

667
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,640
I'm not.

668
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,200
I'm not.

669
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,120
I'm not.

670
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,720
I'm not.

671
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,240
I'm not.

672
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm not.

673
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,680
I'm not.

674
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,360
I'm not.

675
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,040
You...

676
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
What do you want to do?

677
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,480
I want to do

678
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,320
a gift that can remember

679
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,560
us from today.

680
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
What do you mean?

681
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
You'll know when you do it.

682
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,640
Since it's us,

683
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,200
I'll do it with you.

684
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,120
Okay.

685
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,440
As long as you don't mess it up.

686
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,560
What do you need my help with?

687
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,800
You can be its chef.

688
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I'll add water for you.

689
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,760
Okay.

690
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,200
Don't wrap it too much on both sides.

691
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,160
You can't do it like this.

692
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,400
It'll crack.

693
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,840
From the middle.

694
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Come here.

695
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
Okay?

696
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,080
You are so generous.

697
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,840
Of all what we did yesterday,

698
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,280
that must be worth it but only a little.

699
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,960
You later.

700
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,600
Let's have a drink.

701
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,700
A mischievous one.

702
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,440
It's good.

703
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,500
Would you mind,

704
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,400
can you bring somebody here

705
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,740
and we may sit together?

706
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,840
Yeah, I would.

707
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,620
Okay?

708
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,480
Okay.

709
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
Is it difficult?

710
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,140
It's not hard at all.

711
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,420
Do you want to try it?

712
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,900
The next day, I accidentally got close to you

713
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,300
and we had a happy tacit understanding

714
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,740
I like to be your hero

715
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Let's go now

716
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,500
The flowers are here

717
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,460
Thank you

718
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,340
Do you want anything else?

719
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,140
Enough

720
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,980
We are talking about the direction of creation

721
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Come and join us

722
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,340
Okay

723
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,740
Go on

724
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,620
I'm busy

725
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,700
Everyone is talking about

726
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,020
the direction of creation of our novel

727
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,700
Is there any suspense or romance?

728
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,740
Do you have any thoughts?

729
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,460
We can do the drum and drum music

730
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,060
Why?

731
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,740
You are talking to me

732
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,420
The popular ones now

733
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,020
For example, your novel

734
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,260
I feel sorry for you

735
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,980
It's really hard for you to fall in love

736
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,620
But I feel a little bit touched

737
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,380
when I read your novel

738
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,700
What do you feel touched?

739
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,860
This hero

740
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,380
He doesn't even have the ability to give the heroine happiness

741
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,940
He dares to be brave and love her

742
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,700
What else can I be afraid of?

743
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,780
Wait

744
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,740
What do you mean

745
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,340
You don't even have the ability to give the heroine happiness?

746
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,140
I

747
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,860
What's wrong with this hero?

748
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
He is talented

749
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,980
He is talented and has great skills

750
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,780
Why can't he give the heroine happiness?

751
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,500
According to your novel

752
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,500
If the heroine falls in love with the heroine

753
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,780
It's equivalent to

754
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,180
the heroine's long-awaited love

755
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,700
Then the heroine's wish in front of the fairy

756
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,860
will come true

757
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,180
The heroine completes the task and goes back

758
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,380
Then the heroine will be alone in this real world

759
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,260
It's equivalent to separation

760
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,060
But a tragic ending is still good

761
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,540
Tragic

762
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,740
Isn't it?

763
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,420
And don't you think this hero

764
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,340
His behavior is considerate

765
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,460
He comes in a poor state and may disappear at any time

766
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,060
He dares to chase after the heroine like this

767
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,460
Don't you think he is selfish?

768
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,100
But he was a selfish person

769
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,460
This is not out of his character

770
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,260
Don't think too much

771
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,460
I prefer love tragedy

772
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,260
You don't have to be so heartless

773
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,860
You don't have to make any changes

774
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,660
Like I said

775
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,860
You gave me a big inspiration

776
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,060
I have to thank you

777
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Look, this kind of hero

778
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,660
He can confess

779
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,860
What am I afraid of?

780
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,860
Right?

781
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,260
Lan Xin, I'll go buy some food

782
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,860
Why are you sitting here alone?

783
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Bought for me

784
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,460
Try it

785
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,660
I don't want to sit with them

786
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,860
Go over there

787
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,260
it is good

788
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Come on, everyone

789
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,460
We are familiar with the ancient town today

790
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,660
Then don't be together

791
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,460
What about the creation after that?

792
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,260
Let's communicate more

793
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,460
Ok, as the editor-in-chief, I'll mention one first

794
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,860
Come on

795
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,060
Okay, thank you editor-in-chief

796
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,860
Thank you editor-in-chief

797
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
Nana

798
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,660
By the way, friends

799
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,660
Let's go for a walk after dinner

800
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,460
Okay?

801
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,460
it is good

802
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,260
Handsome

803
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,460
Why do you look so down?

804
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,260
No

805
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,060
I'm just a little tired

806
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,260
I don't want to go see fireworks

807
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,460
I can't see fireworks

808
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,860
I'm not going either

809
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,060
Since you two don't go

810
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,260
Do you want to go shopping together?

811
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Hurry up and eat

812
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Let's go see fireworks together later

813
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,860
Ok, go together

814
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,060
I'm very, very, very, very

815
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,660
Don't expect

816
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,460
Me too

817
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Wait a minute, we have to take pictures of each other

818
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,460
You have to take the kind of pictures

819
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
It's the kind of feeling in the friend circle

820
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,060
It's like a kind of feeling

821
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,460
That guy

822
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,660
Handsome

823
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,060
Then you go

824
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,060
We go see fireworks

825
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Bye bye

826
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
Bye bye

827
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Bye bye

828
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Bye bye

829
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Where are you going later?

830
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,260
I feel a little tired

831
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,860
I want to go back and rest

832
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,660
Then I'll go back and rest first

833
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,060
it is good

834
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
it is good

835
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
I'm going to take a walk

836
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
I'm going to take a walk

837
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
I'm going to take a walk

838
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,060
I'm going to take a walk

839
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,060
I'm going to take a walk

840
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,060

00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060

00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
I'm going to take a walk

851
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,060
I'm going to take a walk

852
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,060
I'm going to take a walk

853
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
I'm going to take a walk

854
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060

00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
I'm going to take a walk

862
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,060
I'm going to take a walk

863
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
I'm going to take a walk

864
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,060
I'm going to take a walk

865
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,060
I'm going to take a walk

866
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,060

I'm going to take a walk

883
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,060
Maybe it represents my heart

884
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,060
Oh, every sunset

885
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,060
The next sunrise promised

886
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Accidentally get close to the tacit understanding

887
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,060
Like to be your advantage

888
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Now set off

889
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:10,960
Turn a few

890
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,060
Sunlight brings a new day

891
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Run with you

892
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
You are the god

893
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,060
Walk through my animal's grass

894
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,060
Accompany me

895
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,060
My hero can always report in time

896
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Drive away all my troubles

897
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Oh, every corner

898
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Oh, the soil of love

899
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Special relationship

900
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,060
A little star

901
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Maybe it represents my heart

902
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,060
Oh, every person

903
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,060
Oh, every person

904
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,060
The next sunrise promised

905
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,060
Accidentally get close to the tacit understanding

906
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,060
Like to be your advantage

907
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Now set off
