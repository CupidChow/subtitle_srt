1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Katara n

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You are the past and the right to change your destiny

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Come for me, stay for me

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You will fill my heart

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be with me

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Story of Ming Lan

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm a villain in your novel

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm a devil, right?

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I should have told you earlier

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You don't have to say sorry to me

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Because I didn't do anything wrong

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This thing

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's beyond your imagination

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you not angry?

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not angry at all

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Can you be happy?

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Actually I know what you think

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Women thought they were just an ordinary ancient man

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But they are not

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm not scolding you

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I mean

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know you are a character from the book

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This thing is beyond your expectation

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was very shocking

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Especially this book was written by me

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Then I am your creator

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In other words, I am your mother

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You don't want to fall in love with your mother

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is normal

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You said before

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I really didn't think about this

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What about now?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I feel a little uncomfortable now

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is it?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It doesn't matter

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Actually these are not important

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is important?

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As long as you think it's important

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will help you to realize

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can't help me with this

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You didn't say it

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How do you know I can't help you?

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Say it

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What do you think is the most important thing?

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I actually just feel

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My life now is meaningless

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When I first came here

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
At least I know who I am

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Although I was also very confused

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But I know where I come from

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am the smartest and strongest person in this world

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But now I find all of this is fake

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I am not the person I imagined

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am not that little butterfly

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What am I living for?

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What else do you need to live for?

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You don't have to think so much

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is my own problem

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't have to think about such a complicated thing with me

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's not okay

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have to be responsible for you

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't treat me like my son

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
These two days

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Just let me think about it

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe I can think of it

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What if you can't think of it?

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I hope I can think of it

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then you promise me

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I must think of it

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Can I control this?

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just promise me

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, I promise you

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What else?

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Tell me when you think of it

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Nanxing

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't lock the door

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm going out soon

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Ok

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Bye bye

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good morning, Mr. Ye

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Good morning

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I am here

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I am here

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I am here

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I am here

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I am here

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I am here

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Good morning, Mr. Ye

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Good morning

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Good morning, Mr. Ye

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Good morning

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Good morning

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mr. Ye

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Good morning

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who walked into the room?

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I didn't tell you

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
because I didn't want to do this

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sister Qing

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Jiaojiao, you are so realistic

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
People say that people leave and people don't leave

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But you have become sister Qing

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let me see

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't cry

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You will be beautiful when you cry

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Girls don't cry

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will feel bad when I cry

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why do two men cry like this?

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have never seen you like this

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I will take you down

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you cry again, I will take a picture

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ok

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Just take it as me going on vacation

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Anyway, I haven't had a good rest for so many years

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
From now on

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can think about how many points to get up every day

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Eat whatever you want

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No need to go to the hard work

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In this case, are you very envious of me?

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Mr. Ye, since you are going on vacation

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Then have a good rest

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Brothers and sisters in the company

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We will continue to work hard

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Mr. Ye, come on

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Mr. Ye, can we take a picture together?

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We can take a picture together

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on, Mr. Ye, take a picture together

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Come on

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I want to see you laugh

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Three, two, one

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I really want to resign

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sit down

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The chief editor told me

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You are handing over the work to him

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have arranged the company's business

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All things have a corresponding person

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you angry with me?

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it because I didn't let you take a vacation that day?

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I am not angry

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I am not angry

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I am not angry

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it because I didn't let you take a vacation that day?

147
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I am giving you a vacation now

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I am not angry with you

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I just think that the two of us

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's not suitable to work together now

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why is it not suitable?

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think it's quite suitable

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All business in the company

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's on the right track

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Each position has a corresponding person

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't worry

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have a big problem

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have already greeted the personnel department

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can sign a contract

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will not sign

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I won't let you resign

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No matter if you agree or not

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I will not change

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You should know it for so many years

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So many years

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You didn't like me

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't mention the past

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Mr. Ye, did you clean up?

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come and sit

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A gift for you

171
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What is this?

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is a present

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I bought it for you

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What is this?

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a present

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I bought it for you

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I bought it for you

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why did you buy it for me?

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I just want to ask you

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's go

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's go

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's go

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is my gift.

186
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,080
Assistant secret book.

187
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
You are so...

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
So stupid, right?

189
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
So cute.

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
This is the end of all the work

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,880
I've done since I became an assistant.

192
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
You'll need it soon.

193
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Mr. Ye.

195
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,360
I can't bear to see you leave.

196
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,200
Nanxing, do you know?

197
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,840
I've always been very optimistic about you.

198
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,040
Since you got into the company,

199
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,720
you've been working harder than anyone else.

200
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,560
You've learned faster than anyone else.

201
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
You can now be an assistant.

202
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
But I hope you can figure out one thing.

203
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,480
What is the path you really want to take?

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,000
When everyone gave you the gift,

205
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,280
I saw that...

206
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,760
you were surrounded by everyone.

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,120
You were so strong,

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
strong,

209
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
and beautiful.

210
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
I was thinking,

211
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,160
I want to be someone like you.

212
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,400
Do you know?

213
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Actually,

214
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,040
I can see your talent from your work.

215
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,480
I think you can be a successful and outstanding writer

216
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,360
like your boss.

217
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,840
A writer like my boss?

218
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Impossible.

219
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Why?

220
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Nanxing,

221
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,960
do you know what you're missing?

222
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,200
You're the fearless boss

223
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,880
when you were young.

224
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,400
Even if you don't believe in yourself,

225
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,040
you should believe in why I chose you.

226
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,560
I want to chase you in the crowd

227
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,360
But I can't hear you even if you're too far

228
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,920
Can you open your eyes

229
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,520
and listen to the song in this scene

230
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,560
Trying to find a way to bear it

231
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,760
Trying to look through the end of nightmare

232
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,440
How to end the dream

233
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,960
Waiting for yearning to go away

234
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,560
I want to be the last one to be with you

235
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,080
The moment I wake up

236
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,560
I'm afraid my heart will break

237
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,840
Let the story over the world

238
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,560
Try to show you everything will be

239
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
All these years,

240
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,240
have you ever liked me?

241
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,360
When I walk into the dark night

242
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Don't mention the past

243
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,640
When I walk into the dark night

244
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Please stay by my side

245
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Waiting for the sun to set

246
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,640
We all will be the flower

247
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,640
No matter why or black

248
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,640
I thought the light would not go out

249
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
by the night

250
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,120
There's a vacancy back there and take a seat.

251
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
Get another peg.

252
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,520
Alright.

253
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,680
We're difference-markt�로.

254
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:07,920
Ray broydis?

255
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,480
OK.

256
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,160
Just a second.

257
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,680
Why are you here?

258
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
There's too many people.

259
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,120
We don't have time to look after you.

260
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm Fortune 5----

261
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,440
Lucky them in snazh feet

262
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,240
I'm so hungry.

263
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,960
Do you want food?

264
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,240
Sure.

265
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,360
I'll go down first.

266
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,680
Okay.

267
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,360
I'll go down again.

268
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
Boss, when will mine be ready?

269
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,000
Mom, can I sleep with you tonight?

270
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,200
Come on.

271
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,720
Sleep.

272
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,360
I have to get up early tomorrow.

273
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,280
No one wants to be a winrror.

274
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Okay, bring it his наo.

275
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,360
Mom.

276
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,200
Tell me,

277
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,840
why was he born?

278
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
What's wrong with you?

280
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Are you okay?

281
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm fine.

282
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
I just can't sleep.

283
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm just thinking.

284
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,880
You don't usually think about this.

285
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
You must be busy.

286
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,320
Tell me. What's wrong?

287
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
I just want to say

288
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,800
if I create a person

289
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
and then...

290
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Are you pregnant?

291
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,360
No.

292
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,120
How can I be pregnant?

293
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
What do you mean by creating a person?

294
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
You're pregnant.

295
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
How many months have passed?

296
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Who's the father?

297
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm just giving an example.

298
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,880
You scared me.

299
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,600
Let me put it this way.

300
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,120
I have a friend.

301
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,680
He doesn't know the meaning of his life.

302
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,360
I want to talk to him.

303
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,440
But I found out

304
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,720
that I don't know what the meaning of life is.

305
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
The meaning of life, right?

306
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,600
Life is all about living.

307
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
When someone is born,

308
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,520
they know what kind of person they will be in the future

309
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
and what kind of things they will do.

310
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,400
What kind of contribution they will make to this world.

311
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Right?

312
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Yes.

313
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,080
But my friend

314
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,120
thinks that his past life

315
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,760
is all arranged.

316
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
He's very free.

317
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,840
No one has pure freedom.

318
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,120
No matter how many of us are there,

319
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
we have to accept all the arrangements.

320
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,360
The simplest thing is

321
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,560
that we can't choose our parents.

322
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Right?

323
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
So we just live our lives

324
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,680
and do what we like.

325
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,000
And enjoy our life.

326
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,880
That's the meaning of life.

327
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,200
What we want now is to sleep right away.

328
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,480
Got it?

329
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,760
Go back to sleep.

330
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,600
Good night.

331
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,200
Good night.

332
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,920
Why didn't you sleep at this time?

333
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Xiaodi.

334
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,800
My mom said

335
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,120
that we all live our lives.

336
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,040
Everyone has been arranged.

337
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,920
But as long as you do what you like,

338
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,640
you can find the meaning of life.

339
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
How about I ask my mom to do it for me?

340
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,120
I'll do it for you.

341
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I'll do it for you.

342
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
I'll do it for you.

343
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
I'll do it for you.

344
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
I'll do it for you.

345
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
I'll do it for you.

346
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
How about I ask my mom to do it for you?

347
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,120
She'll be so proud of you.

348
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Stop it.

349
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,120
Are you thinner?

350
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
No.

351
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,120
No matter how messy your brain is,

352
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
you have to take good care of yourself.

353
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Eat and sleep.

354
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
Otherwise,

355
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
when you figure out the meaning of life,

356
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,920
you'll starve to death.

357
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
What's the point?

358
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,520
I have a magical body.

359
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,920
I won't die.

360
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,120
That won't work.

361
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I have a handsome boyfriend.

362
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,520
If you're hungry,

363
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll find a way to push you.

364
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,320
You're so arrogant.

365
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
You think I'm handsome?

366
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
What's the point of being handsome?

367
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
You're already a bad person.

368
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
What do you mean by that?

369
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,720
Look at you.

370
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
You're more handsome than normal people.

371
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
You're smarter than normal people.

372
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
You know martial arts.

373
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
You're more handsome than normal people.

374
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
You're smarter than normal people.

375
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
You know martial arts.

376
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
You're very wise.

377
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,520
You can do whatever you want.

378
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,520
If even people like you can't find the meaning of life,

379
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
will we normal people live?

380
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
What's the point?

381
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I'm still a fake.

382
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,920
What's the difference between you and us?

383
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
You're not a real person.

384
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,120
Do you remember

385
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
what you looked like when you were little?

386
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,320
I do.

387
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,520
I never thought about this before.

388
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,520
But these past two days,

389
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
I've been thinking about it very hard.

390
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,120
I realized I don't have any memories of that time.

391
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,520
Do you understand?

392
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
The problem I have

393
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
can only be solved by myself.

394
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
You don't have to think too much

395
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
to add to your burden.

396
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't worry.

397
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
You don't have to worry about me.

398
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Go back to sleep.

399
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,920
Goodnight.

400
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
Little girl.

401
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
I'm sorry.

402
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
I'm sorry.

403
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm sorry.

404
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
I'll be responsible for you.

406
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,320
Okay.

407
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,120
But you can't lie to me.

408
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,920
What am I lying to you about?

409
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Just wait.

410
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Goodnight.

411
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Goodnight.

412
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,820
We were7 years old.

413
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,520
Just now, when I heard the rumors that Su Long left the factory,

414
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,520
I thought I was dreaming wide awake.

415
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,320
But now, I've actually become a burden.

416
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,740
As if I used to make myself look like this

417
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,120
as a person even when we were clicking freezer preparing for myuni!

418
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,020
I feel so relaxed right after I explains what happened!

419
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,120
Doesn't it just feel like I need to walk my adventure to really know stuff?

420
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,720
I feel like I can do everything.

421
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
You're just leaving the company at night.

422
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
It's not like the sky has fallen.

423
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Your company will send someone to manage it.

424
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,320
Don't worry.

425
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,520
Nothing will happen.

426
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,560
But back to the point.

427
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,040
You're the boss.

428
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,720
You're always so arrogant.

429
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
How can you face your employees?

430
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,560
How can your shareholders

431
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,920
have faith in you?

432
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Don't worry.

433
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Since you don't have faith in me.

434
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
Why did you support me?

435
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
I'll tell you the truth.

436
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,280
I didn't plan on supporting you back then.

437
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,760
With your plan for the Sky Night Forum.

438
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,080
Who would have thought

439
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,920
that it would work?

440
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,080
And I'm not afraid of anything.

441
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,680
If Ye Qing didn't bring that proposal book to me,

442
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,160
how could I have already paid you so quickly?

443
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,840
So, I have confidence in Ye Qing, not you.

444
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,080
What do you mean by that? She asked you to come here in private?

445
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,200
I thought that she was just a little girl who wanted to take advantage of the situation.

446
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,760
So, I gave her some conditions and wanted her to give in.

447
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,040
I didn't expect that she would agree to it and even get the proposal done.

448
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,960
What did she agree to?

449
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,200
She agreed that I can't be with you.

450
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,920
Otherwise, I would withdraw all my investment.

451
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,560
You really said that?

452
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,080
Really.

453
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,000
You really said that?

454
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,720
Really.

455
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,080
I just wanted to scare her.

456
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,920
I didn't expect that she was quite tough.

457
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,200
She's tougher than you.

458
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,040
Come home quickly.

459
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Tell me about the company's business and the environment.

460
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,160
Tell you that I'm going to retire.

461
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,640
I will give you your money back.

462
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,480
Don't try to control my company anymore.

463
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,680
Don't try to control my life.

464
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,280
Can you really do that?

465
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,320
If you're tough enough, don't use the company's cash flow.

466
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,440
Those shares are also a lot of money.

467
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,560
I don't believe that anyone in this city would dare to take this job.

468
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,680
It's a deal.

469
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,840
Stinky brat.

470
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,080
Mom, look.

471
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,560
You didn't forget the red rice cake, right?

472
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,880
Not bad.

473
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,480
You're pretty fast.

474
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,960
Why aren't you answering?

475
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,040
Advertising. Don't mind it.

476
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,960
Our filling and the skin are almost not enough.

477
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,680
There are some left.

478
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,440
Thank you.

479
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,880
Ye Qing, where did you go?

480
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,840
You didn't receive my call and I didn't go to терриential company

481
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,880
to look for you either.

482
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,920
Here's your quick deal.

483
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
Thanks.

484
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,820
Okey.

485
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,580
Bye-bye.

486
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I want to make a gift that can record our beginning from today.

487
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Xiaowudi, help me.

488
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
What's the matter?

489
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Xiaowudi, welcome to this world.

490
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,240
From today, you are a member of our family.

491
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,240
I hope you can grow up healthy and happy.

492
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
What's this?

493
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Didn't you say you didn't have childhood memories?

494
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
I'll give it to you.

495
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Let's go. Let's go to the next one.

496
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Come and sit.

497
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Sit.

498
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Turn to page 34.

499
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:40,240
September 9th, Yishan Dong Brothers.

500
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Xiaowudi, what are you looking at?

501
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Hand it over to me.

502
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
You are not serious about class.

503
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
You are reading comic books here.

504
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
You go to the station.

505
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Lin Hao.

506
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Happy birthday to you.

507
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Happy birthday to you.

508
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Happy birthday to you.

509
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Bye

510
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Xiao Wu Di

511
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm sorry

512
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,880
I know I can't make up for your life's shortcomings

513
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
But

514
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,160
Today is your birthday

515
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I hope

516
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,160
I can spend every birthday with you in the future

517
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Today I'll give you a privilege

518
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
You can blow out the candles and make a wish

519
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
I'll close my eyes

520
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Okay

521
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Light the candles

522
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Okay

523
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Is it lit?

524
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Yes

525
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Make a wish

526
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
I hope I can stay in this world forever

527
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
and protect Dan Xi forever

528
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Done?

529
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Done

530
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Blow out the candles

531
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Let's blow out the candles together

532
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Okay

533
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Happy birthday, Xiao Wu Di

534
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Happy birthday, Xiao Wu Di

535
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Nan Xin

536
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Thank you

537
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm happy

538
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
Xiao Wu Di

539
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Xiao Wu Di

540
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Xiao Wu Di, don't mess with me

541
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Xiao Wu Di, don't mess with me

542
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Xiao Wu Di

543
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Xiao Wu Di

544
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
I didn't buy anything from the ancient times

545
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I didn't buy anything from the ancient times

546
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
I didn't buy anything from the ancient times

547
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Xiao Wu Di

548
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Save me

549
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I need you now

550
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Xiao Wu Di

551
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Save me

552
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
I haven't celebrated your birthday with you yet

553
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Come out

554
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Save me

555
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Save me

556
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Save me

557
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Baba

558
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
gakmau

559
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
The atmosphere is good

560
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
My hero can always catch up with me in time

561
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,160
To drive away all my troubles

562
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh every corner

563
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh the soil of love

564
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Special relationship, a little bit like a star

565
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Maybe it represents my heart

566
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh every sunset

567
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh the next sunrise I promised

568
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,160
I accidentally got close to the tacit understanding of love

569
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Like to be your hero

570
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Let's go now

571
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Turn a few tens of thousands of suns

572
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Bring a new day to run with you

573
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,160
You are the god who walked through my animal bridge

574
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Accompany me

575
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Occasionally, the smile is in your bowl

576
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,160
The atmosphere is good

577
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,160
My hero can always catch up with me in time

578
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,160
To drive away all my troubles

579
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh every corner

580
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh the soil of love

581
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Special relationship, a little bit like a star

582
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Maybe it represents my heart

583
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh every sunset

584
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Lai lai lai lai lai oh the next sunrise I promised

585
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I accidentally got close to the tacit understanding of love

586
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Like to be your hero

587
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Let's go now
