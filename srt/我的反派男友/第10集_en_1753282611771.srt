1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
I hear you from afar.

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,640
You're destined to be with me.

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Come to me.

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,040
Stay with me.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
You're the past and the past.

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I'll never change my destiny.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,480
Come for me.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,800
Stay for me.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,440
Your look fills my heart.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,360
I'll be with me.

11
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,360
Wait.

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I... I called you again?

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,360
I...

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
I know.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,440
I know you don't like being called.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,800
Every time I call you,

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
I'll interrupt your work.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,200
I know I'm going too far.

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,080
But I really want to ask you out this time.

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Didn't you say you wanted to play in the secret room?

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
You wanted to try it.

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,760
I didn't expect you to be so angry.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
I shouldn't have...

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm not angry.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Do I look so easy to be angry?

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,440
You've been angry since yesterday.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm not angry.

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,160
I...

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Forget it. You won't understand.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Let's go.

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
Aren't we going to play in the secret room?

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Everyone's here.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,280
Hello.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,040
Let's go.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,080
Go.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
The door is open.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,320
No one's here.

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,360
I can't...

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,400
Let's go...

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,640
Let's go.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,120
Okay.

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,200
Go.

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,120
Go away.

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,800
after R Majiang's death

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,800
S ....

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,720
Dull

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
You want the ring?

48
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
What do you want?

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,580
So you can kill someone

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,600
Continue

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,300
I want to find the

52
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,160
branch of the

53
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Fanzu...

54
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Fanzu...

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Fanzu, I...

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
I'll kill myself.

57
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,560
Then I'll go with Xiaodi.

58
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Let's go.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Let's go.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,760
Xiaodi, let's go.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,360
Let's go.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
Why is it so dark?

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,160
Are you okay?

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,960
This way?

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Please prove that you were not infected

66
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
according to the clues in the picture.

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,360
If you complete the proof

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
and the door is unlocked

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,960
within the specified time,

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
you will be relieved.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
If you fail,

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,760
you will be killed.

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,760
Choose a move.

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,560
Press...

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,560
Press...

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Press.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,760
Press the button.

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,160
Okay.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
Press.

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,160
It's okay.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,760
One more time.

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,960
Press.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,960
Press.

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
These three are easy.

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
The legs are bent.

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,960
Okay.

87
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
The last one.

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Just hold it.

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,960
You...

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,560
What?

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Just hold it like this?

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
What's wrong with holding it?

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Just hold it like this.

94
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,360
Just hold it like this?

95
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,960
How else can I hold it?

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
I'll hold it while singing.

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,160
No.

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I mean

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
this lonely man and widow

100
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
just hold it together casually.

101
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Aren't you usually

102
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,160
shy?

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,560
We are so close.

104
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,760
What's wrong with holding it?

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Do you still want to go out?

106
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
No.

107
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
What's wrong with you?

108
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
I feel that

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,960
you are strange recently.

110
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
How am I strange?

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,360
You are strange.

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,760
You are

113
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,760
so shy.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Sometimes,

115
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
I feel that you are angry.

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
But sometimes, you don't seem to be angry.

117
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
You are not like the old you.

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
If you were the old you,

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
you would...

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
I, Mr. He Huan,

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
am not the kind of person

122
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,360
who cares about the beauty of the world.

123
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,560
What kind of man and woman can't be told clearly?

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,160
I want to be clear.

125
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,160
This is the old you.

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
You are talking like a thief.

127
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,760
I didn't mean that.

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
I mean how happy you were before.

129
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
Why are you now like...

130
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,360
like a middle school student

131
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,960
who likes others secretly?

132
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,760
You really have someone you like?

133
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
No way.

134
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,760
Can I really say it right?

135
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,760
Who?

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Do I know him?

137
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Which elementary school?

138
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,560
Jinling High School.

139
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Zhu Meiyu High School.

140
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
No.

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,960
Stop talking.

142
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I understand.

143
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,560
You are afraid that he will be jealous,

144
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,760
so you don't dare to hug me.

145
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You must be joking.

146
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,160
I, Xiao Wu Di, am afraid of a woman.

147
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
You got it wrong.

148
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,960
You really have a woman.

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,160
Right?

150
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,160
Right?

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,560
You just said a few words to me

152
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
and you revealed your little secret.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
That's right.

154
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
I do have someone I like.

155
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
The person I like

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
is you.

157
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
The door is open.

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,560
That was so exciting.

159
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,160
I tell you,

160
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,960
I've never been so excited.

161
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,560
I tell you,

162
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,960
I was so scared just now.

163
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,360
Right, right, right.

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,760
It was so scary when you were bending your legs.

165
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,960
You two are too slow.

166
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
Time has passed for so long

167
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
and you have reached the end.

168
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
That was so hard.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
I won't be able to finish this next time.

170
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,960
It's all your fault.

171
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
It's not hard, Senior.

172
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Let's go down.

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
I didn't see it.

174
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,960
He really didn't see it at all.

175
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,560
No wonder he's been single for so many years.

176
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
It's so beautiful.

177
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,360
Look over there.

178
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Xiao Wo Di,

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,360
are you happy today?

180
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
I'm fine.

181
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
That's good.

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,960
I'm really smart.

183
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
You ride well.

184
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
You ride well.

185
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,960
Xiao Wo Di,

186
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
who's coming home first?

187
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm back.

188
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
You're back.

189
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
Mom.

190
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
What's good?

191
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
You're so silly.

192
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
I'm so happy that I need to find a reason.

193
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,160
I want to ask you.

194
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Why haven't you written that novel recently?

195
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
I've been so tired from work recently.

196
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,760
I don't have time to write.

197
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I like it.

198
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,160
You really don't write it?

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
I don't write it.

200
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,760
And I found out that I'm familiar with my boss.

201
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,160
I can't write anything that can make him feel bad.

202
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,760
You can make others feel bad if you don't make him feel bad.

203
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Then who else can I make him feel bad?

204
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
The bear on the other side.

205
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
Isn't that the one on the scene?

206
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
No, no.

207
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
Why not?

208
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
I can't.

209
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,160
How do you know?

210
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,560
I think I can.

211
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,960
You're so stupid.

212
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,960
Why do you have to make yourself feel bad?

213
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,360
He can't find out anyway.

214
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,360
You should be happy first.

215
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,180
MAC Stop

216
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Today you did a great job.

217
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
For activities like imperial attempts,

218
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,160
you can let me do more.

219
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Let's do this.

220
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Finish what we started, camouflage our future.

221
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,160
And here is the

222
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,220
Top choice

223
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,960
What is it?

224
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,600
Small

225
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,780
What is it?

226
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,580
Yes

227
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,180
Forget your

228
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,060
Look you

229
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,380
Cheninci

230
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,460
How much

231
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Cheninci

232
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Three, two, one.

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Don't move.

234
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I'm leaving after saying goodbye to me.

235
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
problematic tips.

237
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
No problem.

238
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Okay.

239
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

240
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
problematic tips.

241
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
No problem.

242
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Okay.

243
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

244
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
problematic tips.

245
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
No problem.

246
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

247
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
problematic tips.

248
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
No problem.

249
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

250
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
problematic tips.

251
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
No problem.

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

253
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
problematic tips.

254
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
No problem.

255
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

256
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
problematic tips.

257
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
No problem.

258
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

259
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
problematic tips.

260
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Okay.

261
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm leaving now.

262
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Okay.

263
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

264
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,360
problematic tips.

265
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Goodbye, Tang Li.

266
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I'll go to the office after I get those

267
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
problematic tips.

268
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
No problem.

269
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
We won't agree to this

270
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
choice.

271
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
The procedure will probably be

272
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
done by a lawsuit.

273
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
If so,

274
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,080
Thanks

275
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,080
Come in

276
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,040
Mr. Yue

277
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,840
Are you there to see me?

278
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,360
I need to request you

279
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,420
What's up?

280
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you want something to keep from me?

281
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Shoot

282
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,240
Does he know I blackmailed the boss for passion?

283
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,760
The secret偷 in the forum

284
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,720
Is it you?

285
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
It's me. How did you know?

286
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Did you write this story?

287
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Why is it still here?

288
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
This article was deleted before.

289
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Then, some netizens posted it on the internet.

290
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
I saw it.

291
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,360
The heroine in the story should be Zi Chen.

292
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
The heroine is the same as you, Nan Xiaoxin.

293
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
The big villain Xiao Wu Di is also your neighbor.

294
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
It's not that coincidental.

295
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Yes. How could it be so coincidental?

296
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
So you admit it?

297
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Ye. I didn't mean to blame Boss.

298
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I was just writing it.

299
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
And it doesn't mean I like Boss.

300
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Look, Boss wrote so many mysterious novels.

301
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
It doesn't mean he killed anyone, right?

302
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I can't delete it.

303
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
I haven't written it since I got in.

304
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Really?

305
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,360
How about I contact the postman and ask him to delete it?

306
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm afraid it will have a bad effect on the company.

307
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I swear I won't write it again.

308
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Why not?

309
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Why not?

310
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
The company's Star Project Chinese competition.

311
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I think you should go.

312
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Of course, you can't use this.

313
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I can't use this?

314
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm going to participate in Star Project?

315
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Why not?

316
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I think the heroine Lu you're competing with

317
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
is not so great.

318
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
But she and Nan Xiaoxin's love is very sincere.

319
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I like to see the interaction between them.

320
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I'm looking forward to what new stories you have.

321
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,360
But I've never written a original novel.

322
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Such a real competition.

323
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,360
The comments under my post were all scolding me.

324
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Don't be anxious to deny yourself.

325
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Look at all the comments under this post.

326
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Then make a judgment, okay?

327
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I think you should participate.

328
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Think about it.

329
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Go.

330
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Boss.

332
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Come here.

333
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Why don't you send me WeChat?

334
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Did Mr. Ye look for you?

335
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
This time is good.

336
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
He didn't even look for the lie.

337
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah.

338
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Talk about work?

339
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Talk about work?

340
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,360
He said he wouldn't let me write your同仁文.

341
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Talk about some girls.

342
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,360
What kind of relationship and work are going to be separated?

343
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Shouldn't.

344
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
He doesn't want to separate.

345
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
No way.

346
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
I mean my friend.

347
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
He asked her out last time.

348
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Then Mr. Ye naturally started talking about work.

349
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,360
You mean this aspect.

350
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Yeah.

351
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
He asked someone out with an assistant.

352
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Who knows what you're going to do?

353
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Then what do you think my friend should do next

354
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
to make him realize this problem?

355
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Boss, don't ask me anymore.

356
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
I don't know anything.

357
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,360
If I knew, I wouldn't be single for so many years.

358
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Then you're a woman.

359
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
You know better than a man like me.

360
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Then you should

361
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
be more persistent.

362
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Make more coincidences.

363
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Then he will realize one day.

364
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
So that's what people do.

365
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
I don't know the living.

366
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
It's all written in the book.

367
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
I know.

368
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
I won't say it out.

369
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
It's okay. I'm leaving.

370
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Okay.

371
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Make more coincidences.

372
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
I'm leaving.

373
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
I'm leaving.

374
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
I'm leaving.

375
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
I'm leaving.

376
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm leaving.

377
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I'm leaving.

378
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm leaving.

379
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
I'm leaving.

380
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm leaving.

381
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
I'm leaving.

382
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm leaving.

383
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
I'm leaving.

384
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
I'm leaving.

385
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I'm leaving.

386
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
δ throne

387
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
There were too many secrets

388
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
that I should keep.

389
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
What secrets?

390
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Nothing.

391
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
It's well-made,

392
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
but why pork?

393
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
Lan Xing!

394
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Have you informalized with the boss?

395
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Yes.

396
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,760
He also agrees with my change.

397
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,160
He wants me to change the answer.

398
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
I'll tell you when I'm done.

399
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Okay, that's good.

400
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,160
It means he's already

401
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,240
recognized your ability.

402
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,000
Keep it up, Nan Xing.

403
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
Okay, Miss.

404
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,680
Why didn't you reply to my message?

405
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,480
What are you doing?

406
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
What's wrong with him?

407
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,040
The boss called me away.

408
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,080
I want steak.

409
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
Don't order takeout.

410
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,480
You can order it yourself.

411
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,200
Find a high-priced restaurant.

412
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,200
Okay.

413
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,760
Hello?

414
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
Where are you?

415
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,120
At the office.

416
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,680
It's lunchtime.

417
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,600
Come down.

418
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,560
Didn't you say you wanted steak?

419
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Three minutes.

420
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,600
If you don't come down, I'll go up.

421
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,040
Mr. Zhang.

422
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,880
Who's that?

423
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,440
A friend.

424
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,120
You're here so fast. The dishes are still hot.

425
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Why are you so anxious?

426
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
I don't want to drink.

427
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
I want you to open it for me.

428
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
Mr. Xiao,

429
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I came running.

430
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,120
You let me do this?

431
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I want to have lunch with you.

432
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I've ordered it.

433
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Eat it.

434
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
I don't eat beef.

435
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,880
It's okay. Try the other dishes.

436
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
What do you want from me?

437
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I have to go back to the company.

438
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
You don't even have time to eat with me.

439
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
I have.

440
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Help me pick some dishes.

441
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
And that,

443
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
fries.

444
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
This?

445
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
What does he want again?

446
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Do you want this?

447
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
You can try it.

448
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
What about this?

449
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Here, this.

450
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Okay, don't bother about me.

451
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
You eat it.

452
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Don't always think I'm bullying you.

453
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm actually nice to you.

454
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
This restaurant is not cheap, okay?

455
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Hello.

456
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Mr. Xiao, hello.

457
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
My name is Jiao Jiao.

458
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm a colleague of Nan Xing.

459
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Hello.

460
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
What's going on?

461
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
So many people are here.

462
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
I told you not to come.

463
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Mr. Xiao.

464
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
That,

465
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
which year were you born?

466
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
He,

467
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
not that old.

468
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
A young talent.

469
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
So you are,

470
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
a local?

471
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm from the outside.

472
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Which city?

473
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
In the mountains.

474
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
The countryside is good.

475
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Now they are promoting new countryside construction.

476
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
It's not like the countryside.

477
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
It's not like the countryside.

478
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
It's not like the countryside.

479
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
The countryside is clean and the people are clean.

480
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Jiao Jiao, have a pizza.

481
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
She has a chance to eat pizza every day.

482
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
But today,

483
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
she only has a chance to talk.

484
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
And,

485
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Nan Xing told me you were neighbors.

486
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
But I think you are here

487
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
to have lunch with her.

488
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
I want to confirm

489
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
if you are still neighbors.

490
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
There is no change in this relationship.

491
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Of course there is.

492
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
She is my neighbor.

493
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
She just passed by.

494
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Passing by is good.

495
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Passing by means someone else

496
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
has a chance.

497
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Jiao Jiao, have a pizza.

498
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
What are you talking about?

499
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Am I

500
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
thinking too much?

501
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Too far?

502
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Actually, Nan Xing has been

503
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
very, very advanced recently.

504
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
When I was sending the documents to the boss today,

505
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
he asked me specifically,

506
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
and he is very considerate.

507
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I was confused.

508
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Nan Xing, you are amazing.

509
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
You and the boss

510
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
have changed so fast.

511
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
Be careful, Miss Ye.

512
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
It's not hot, right?

513
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
It's okay.

514
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
There is so much water.

515
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
I can't sit.

516
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
I'll help you.

517
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Hurry up.

518
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
My legs.

519
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Take the wet tissue.

520
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Okay.

521
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Be careful.

522
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
It's hot.

523
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Is it okay on your clothes?

524
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
It's okay on my clothes.

525
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
It's still water.

526
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I spent the afternoon

527
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
in the company.

528
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I came out to see the bed.

529
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
This is the rule of law.

530
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
If I drink the water,

531
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I will kill you.

532
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
You are so cool.

533
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
What cool?

534
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I am very generous.

535
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
How can I be cool?

536
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Mr. Jiao,

537
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
let's go back to work.

538
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Let's meet next time.

539
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Bye.

540
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Bye.

541
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm going to work, too.

542
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Wait.

543
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
I'm free tonight.

544
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Let's go to the

545
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
last secret room.

546
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Tonight?

547
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I had my own business at noon.

548
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I came to eat with you.

549
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
So I thought I had time

550
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
to think about it.

551
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
You forgot what you said last night.

552
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Okay.

553
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
It's a must.

554
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Just once?

555
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Okay.

556
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
I promise you.

557
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Even if I don't promise you,

558
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
you will make me promise you.

559
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
But don't call Xiong Sisi and the others.

560
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
They are too stupid.

561
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Go with us.

562
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Just the two of us.

563
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Okay.

564
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm going to work.

565
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Okay.

566
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Make more coincidences.

567
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
You will realize it one day.

568
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
I wrote some notes.

569
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Okay.

570
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
I'll talk to you later.

571
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Boss, look at this.

572
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Boss, it's just right.

573
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
I'll talk to you later.

574
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Boss.

575
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Boss, is it convenient for you

576
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
to discuss this document?

577
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
You can go.

578
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Let's go.

579
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
What are you doing?

580
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Huh?

581
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Right, I want to ask you something.

582
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
The painter last time

583
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
told me that he didn't know you.

584
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,960
He said that he's going to be on the plane

585
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
because the flight is cancelled.

586
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
But didn't you want to introduce us to each other?

587
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
No.

588
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Then why did you ask me out?

589
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,560
Just watch the paintings. If you like it, I'll show you.

590
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,640
That's it?

591
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,560
That's it.

592
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,880
If you're interested, I'll share the news with you.

593
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,840
I'll go buy coffee. What do you want to drink?

594
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,640
They're the same.

595
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,720
Hi, handsome boy!

596
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,120
What a coincidence!

597
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,840
It's not a coincidence. I have an appointment with a friend just now,

598
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,240
to eat and I'm also in a rush.

599
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,160
I can't hang with you guys today.

600
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,400
I'll be going now, then.

601
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,040
Bye, Miss!

602
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,880
Bye bye!

603
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,120
Bye, Handsome boy!

604
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I like to read.

605
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
I do not want to.

606
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,140
So sweet.

607
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
We just happened to pass up.

608
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,640
You must be busy today!

609
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,700
Let's go.

610
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,620
Here, here!

611
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,000
Who is it at this hour?

612
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,840
It isEvery Homie.

613
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Please take a rest, gentlemen.

614
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,840
I'll go to the back and give a massage to Miss Qiu.

615
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Will there be a chance to hug in this level?

616
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Today, you're lucky to come to my Lian Qing House.

617
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,840
May I ask which gentleman is going to pass the level?

618
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Him?

619
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Him? His surname is Xiao.

620
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Mr. Xiao.

621
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
This...

622
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
This is unnecessary.

623
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,840
There's no need to do this.

624
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Mr. Xiao.

625
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Please dance with me.

626
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
And dance?

627
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Mr. Xiao.

628
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Come on, Mr. Xiao.

629
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Mr. Xiao.

630
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Come and dance, young master.

631
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Isn't that right?

632
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,840
How did it become like this?

633
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Where's the lock?

634
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Ji Yang Shu He Zhu.

635
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Look.

636
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Look.

637
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Here comes the chance.

638
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
It's okay.

639
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Don't be afraid. It's fake.

640
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Don't be afraid.

641
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
It's fake.

642
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
The sign.

643
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Put it on.

644
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Ladies, please wear your blindfolds.

645
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,840
The male conductor will now start the game.

646
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,840
After completing the mission, there will be a big reward.

647
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Big reward?

648
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
It won't be like before.

649
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
I have to hug to pass the level, right?

650
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
There's another chance.

651
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Come on.

652
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Young master is really impatient.

653
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Let the little girl play a game with you.

654
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Xiao Di, where am I going?

655
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
She's going backwards.

656
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
She's changing people.

657
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Where is she going, Xiao Di?

658
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
You turn right.

659
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
You turn forward.

660
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
You turn back.

661
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
You turn back.

662
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Take her hand.

663
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Turn around.

664
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
I got it.

665
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
I got it.

666
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
You passed the level.

667
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Young master is really good.

668
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
You caught me so quickly.

669
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm going to give you a mysterious reward.

670
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Please accept my kiss.

671
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I'll kiss your head.

672
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Let's go.

673
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Xiao Di.

674
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
What's wrong?

675
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Isn't this interesting?

676
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
You think it's interesting?

677
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
This secret room is so boring.

678
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
It's not as fun as the last time.

679
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Let's play another one.

680
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Another one?

681
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
I have something else to do today.

682
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
How about another day?

683
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Or you play it yourself.

684
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
What's the point of playing it myself?

685
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
You didn't find it interesting to play with me.

686
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,840
It's not interesting without a hug.

687
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Okay.

688
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
You play it yourself.

689
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I'll go and check the cards for you.

690
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
I'll treat you.

691
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Original.

692
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,840
And ask for the first post.

693
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Can I do it?

694
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Under the post I sent before,

695
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
the people in the post are scolding me.

696
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Don't be anxious to deny yourself.

697
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I think the heroine Lu under your post

698
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
is not very good at it.

699
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
But she and Nan Xiaoqing's love

700
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
are still very sincere.

701
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
I like to see

702
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
the interaction between them.

703
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm looking forward to

704
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,840
what new stories you have.

705
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
I think you should participate.

706
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Okay.

707
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I'll try.

708
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
But what should I write?

709
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,840
What should I write?

710
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Let's go for a walk.

711
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Maybe we'll have an inspiration as we walk.

712
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,840
What story can I write?

713
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I only wrote my childhood friend kiss.

714
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
It's all your fault.

715
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
It's all your fault.

716
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
I'm so sorry.

717
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
I'm sorry.

718
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
It's all your fault.

719
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
It's all your fault.

720
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,840
You're so mean.

721
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm so mean.

722
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,840
She's just like a normal person.

723
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
What kind of love is this?

724
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,840
She has the right to listen to me.

725
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I have the right to listen to her.

726
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Is it fair?

727
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Is it fair?

728
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Why?

729
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Xiao Wu Di?

730
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Why are you here?

731
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
What is fair?

732
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
What are you talking about?

733
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Didn't you say you had something to do?

734
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
I have something to do.

735
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm thinking about something in my head.

736
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
You can't figure it out.

737
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
What do you want to tell me?

738
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,840
What's the use of telling you?

739
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm just a cool breeze.

740
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
I should be able to figure it out.

741
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,840
What's the use of telling me?

742
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Tell me.

743
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
What's the matter?

744
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,840
What's wrong with you today?

745
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,840
You passed by by chance today.

746
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
One message on WeChat.

747
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
And then you're in the secret room.

748
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
And you're eating.

749
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Is it all a coincidence now?

750
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Of course it's a coincidence.

751
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
You think I'm stupid?

752
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
What do you want?

753
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Tell me.

754
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Don't let me stay in the secret.

755
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Tell me.

756
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I'll cooperate with you if you tell me.

757
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Okay?

758
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
What's wrong?

759
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,840
You started yesterday, didn't you?

760
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,840
You started yesterday, didn't you?

761
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
What's going on?
