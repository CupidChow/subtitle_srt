181
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,740
Zichen,

182
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,940
if you really

183
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,180
love Qing,

184
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,810
be more mature.

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,020

186
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,500

188

You haven't eaten, right?

190
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,090
Have a bowl of wonton.

191
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,900
Thank you.

192
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,030

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,740
Have a cup of milk.

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,980
Sure. Thanks, Mum.

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,500
Be careful.

261
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,380
It's hot.

262
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:35,790
Okay.

263
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,340
Why are you staying up late these days?

264
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,540
I had to

265
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,250
visit investors with my boss in the day.

266
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,180
I don't have time to think about the plot.

267
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
So I write something when I get home.

268
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,700
That's why I stay up late.

269
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
I've told you that your boss

270
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,620
likes you.

271
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,370
He brought you with him to see

272
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,310
his investors.

273
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,260
I went there

274
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,900
to support him.

275
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,660
I guess my boss

276
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,220
was a bit nervous.

277
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,180
These matters

278
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,490
were handled by Miss Ye.

279
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,540
But she has left the company.

280
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,700
Why did she leave her position?

281
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,820
They had a fight?

282
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,820
I know.

283
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,380
You're too outstanding.

284
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,820
That's right.

285
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,660
See? I knew it.

286
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,240
Hurry and go to bed.

287
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,450
I'll sleep when I'm done.

288
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,060
Fine.

289
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,820
Don't stay up too late.

290
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,420
Okay.

291
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,300
By the way,

292
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,170
Why don't I see Xiong these days?

293
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,620
He returned to his hometown.

294
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,200
He didn't tell me he'd gone back home.

295
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,260
Okay, I'll leave you be.

296
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,670
Okay.

297
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,910
Get some early rest.

298
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:44,980
Goodnight.

299
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,640
Goodnight.

300
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,099
Mr. Lu,

301
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,869
I'll put it this way.

302
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,579
I had been talking to Ye Qing

303
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,380
before

304
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,569
about financing your company.

305
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,980
I know

306
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,290
how much effort

307
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,829
she put into X-Culture.

308
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,339
So I don't

309
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,020
intend to lie to you.

310
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,900
I know you're going around

311
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,220
meeting investors.

312
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,330
But I can tell you

313
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,140
clearly that

314
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,850
your efforts and dedication

315
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,060
will lead nowhere

316
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,340
and it is better to just give up.

317
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,170
Why?

318
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,340
First,

319
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,460
we agree with your ideals.

320
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,020
Your ideals are great

321
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,260
and your goals are meaningful.

322
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,570
But you know

323
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,730
the world is not short of ideals

324
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,910
but of people

325
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,790
who can turn them into reality.

326
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,770
For X-Culture,

327
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,820
this person is Ye Qing,

328
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,740
not you.

329
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,660
Second,

330
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,020
you shouldn't

331
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,660
kick your father out.

332
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,180
It's not a lot of money,

333
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,440
but as long as he's around,

334
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,850
people will know

335
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,220
that this company

336
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,570
is backed by

337
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,160
a great commercial value.

338
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,270
Now that Ye Qing is gone,

339
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,140
and you don't want
your father's support either.

340
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,260
As an investor,

341
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,860
I find you are acting

342
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,390
very irrationally now.

343
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,940
I understand.

344
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,330
It seems

345
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,040
we don't need to
continue the conversation.

346
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,020
Thank you for your honesty.

347
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,500
Mister.

It's just physical chores.

474
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,180

I feel more relaxed now.

476

I don't have to wear high heels anymore.

477
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,980
I'm not used to it too.

478
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,100

479

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,110
I'll accompany you.

484
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,260

486
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,100
As usual,

487
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,140

Okay, thanks.

489
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,510
Tell me, what do you want from me today?

490
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,100
Mr. Lu

491
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,740
is kicking his father out.

492
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,030
What do you mean?

493
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,220
Mr. Lu wants to buy

494
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,860
all of his father's shares.

495
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,700
But he couldn't touch

496
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,100
the company's cash flow.

497
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,700
Under these circumstances,

498
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,300
no one will help him.

499
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,800
Where could he get that much cash?

500
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,660
So he put his house on sale.

501
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,540
The agent said

502
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,260
his house is a mansion.

503
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,880
So it's easy to get a buyer.

504
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,580
It shouldn't take long

505
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,500
to get a deal.

506
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,790
Mr. Lu didn't say anything,

507
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,930
but I think

508
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,140
this might be related to

509
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,500
your resignation.

510
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,060
I'm thinking

511
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,190
if you can go back and persuade him.

512
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,130
Perhaps

513
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,730
there is a way out of this.

514
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,970
Not bad.

515
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,700
You have become mature now.

516
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,220
Really?

517
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,940
But I'm not

518
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,860
working for X-Culture anymore.

519
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,980
I don't have the stand

520
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,380
to meddle in this matter.

521
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,100
Fine.

522
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,780
Then consider this a day

523
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,770
I came to work

524
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,100
for my ex-leader.

525
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,500
I welcome you

526
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,740
to help me out anytime.

527
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,620
I'll buy you dinner,

528
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,880
but you won't get paid.

529
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,060
You can buy me drinks too, right?

530
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,460
No problem.

531
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,540
Here, try this one.

532
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,070
It's really delicious.

533
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:52,580
[Lu Zichen]

534
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
[Mr. Lu wants to buy]

535
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,200
[all of his father's shares.]

536
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,300
[But he couldn't touch]

537
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,830
[the company's cash flow.]

538
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
[So he put his house on sale.]

539
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,570
[I heard you're kicking your father out.
Why?]

540
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,930
What does this mean?

541
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,390
[Ye Qing]

542
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,660
[I heard]

[that you're kicking your father out.]

544
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,900
[Why so sudden?]

545
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,410
[He told me that you...]

549
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,660
How should I reply to this?

550
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,280
Thank goodness I have Miss Ye's
survival notes.

551
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,300
When will Miss Ye come back?

552
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,740
Even if I have her notes,

553
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,940
I can't handle

554
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,660
all these problems on my own.

Mr. Shi.

557

You two are the only ones left

558

for the New Star Program interview.

559
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,140
Have you forgotten?

560
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,860
I have to finish it before it is released.

561
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,500
Make an appointment with Xiao Wudi

562
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
and get back to me.

563
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,940
Hello.

564
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
[Hello, miss.]

565
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,300
[I am the agent who is in charge]

566
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,660
[of the sale of your property.]

567
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,460
[I would like to inform you that]

568
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,950
[a buyer has been found]

569
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,380
[for Mr. Lu's house.]

570
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,980
That's fast.

571
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,900
It's only been on sale for a few days.

572
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,820
[The housing market
is very hot right now.]

573
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,060
[Especially for a large mansion]

574
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,220
[like Mr. Lu's]

575
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,460
[which is very popular]

576
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,380
[and can be sold at a very good price.]

577
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,940
[Please]

578
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,700
[inform Mr. Lu on my behalf.]

579
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,340
Okay, I got it.

580
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,340
Thank you.

581
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,640
[You're welcome.]

582
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,980
Mr. Lu,

583
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,510
the property agent just called me.

584
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,820
She said the house was sold.

585
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,140
That's what I'm waiting for.

586
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,420
Mr. Lu.

587
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,260
Your son...

588
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,180
What's wrong with him again?

589
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,060
He called to say

590
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,340
that the money to purchase the shares back

591
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,260
was ready.

592
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,260
I've asked around.

593
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,380
He seems to have taken out

594
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,180
all of his cash

595
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,900
and sold his house.

596
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,820
Do you think

597
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,320
I should persuade him?

598
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't.

599
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,060
Why should you persuade him?

600
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
It's rare to see his determination.

601
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,220
Go through the procedures with him.

602
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,880
Roger that.

603
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,610
He sold his house?

604
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,300
Not bad, young lad.

605
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,380
Mr. Lu,

606
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,420
here are the contract

607
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,240
and information you need.

608
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,940
Mr. Lu,

609
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,460
I think you are a bit too...

610
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,620
Childish?

611
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,860
No.

612
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,660
I mean to say you're a bit too impulsive.

613
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,060
It's not that I haven't thought
about the consequences.

614
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,940
Complete independence

615
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,860
might be good

616
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
for our company.

617
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,460
Those people won't work with us

618
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,690
because of my father.

619
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,340
That just means

620
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,420
we're not on the same page.

621
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,540
I can buy another house after selling one.

622
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,800
It's not like I don't have
a place to stay.

623
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,750
Thank you for your hard work these days.

624
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,300
You can leave early today.

625
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,200
Rest at home tomorrow.

626
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,340
Okay.

627
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,700
Don't tell anyone in the company

628
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,460
about what has happened recently.

629
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,380
Okay, I know.

630
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,020
I've already told Mr. Lu.

631
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,520
You can arrange

632
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,110
the exact time on your side.

633
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,460
Okay.

634
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,780
Talk to me if you have any questions.

635
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,380
Thank you for your hard work.

636
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,780
Mr. Shi,

637
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,020
I've seen the cover

638
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,930
that you sent to me.

639
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,260
There are two things
that need to be changed.

640
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,720
I'll send you the details.

641
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:14,970
Okay.

642
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,420
Nan Xing.

643
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:19,940
Mum.

644
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,740
Drink some water.

645
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,620
Take a break.

646
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,420
You've been on the phone all night

647
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,340
talking about work,

648
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,670
you've worked too hard.

649
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,550
There's been a lot going on lately.

650
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,500
I've noticed

651
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,260
that you are different

652
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,860
since Miss Ye left.

653
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,020
No.

654
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,410
How is it not?

655
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,980
The onlooker sees everything clearly.

656
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,820
I think you're getting

657
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,770
that tough woman vibe now.

658
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,380
You're exaggerating.

659
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm not familiar with a lot of work.

660
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,900
I have to depend on this
notebook given to me by Miss Ye

661
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,430
to survive as an assistant.

662
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,380
Don't stress yourself out.

663
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,900
Take your time with everything.

664
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,540
Understand?

665
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,980
Balance your work with your life.

666
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,820
I know.

667
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,740
How about

668
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,050
I take you out for a couple of days

669
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,580
at the weekend?

670
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,980
Let's have a change of mood.

671
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,820
I have to work overtime on the weekend.

672
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,980
Fine then.

673
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,780
You can go and have fun
with your best friends.

674
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,020
That's all I can do.

675
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,100
Listen here,

676
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,940
the body is the key to the revolution.

677
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,340
Don't tire yourself out.

678
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,460
This wind chime

679
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,210
is the same as the one
in your WeChat profile photo.

680
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,270
You just bought it?

681
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,680
Okay, go ahead with your work.
