00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,460
Summer's Desire

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,280
Thank lucky

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,280
One's hidden beauty

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,380
She makes me happy

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm here to see you.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm here to see you.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm here to see you.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm here to see you.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm here to see you.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm here to see you.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm here to see you.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm here to see you.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm here to see you.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm here to see you.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm here to see you.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm here to see you.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm here to see you.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm here to see you.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm here to see you.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm here to see you.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm here to see you.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm here to see you.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm here to see you.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm here to see you.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm here to see you.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm here to see you.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm here to see you.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm here to see you.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You are destined to be with me.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come to me.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Stay with me.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are the past and the past.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I will never change my destiny.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Come for me.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Stay for me.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You look back at my heart.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be with me.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Long Ballad

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 18

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The Long Ballad?

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Qin Ge.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where is he?

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, where is he?

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you know him?

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Since I'm the villain in the book,

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll be with Master Lu

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
as long as I mess around.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Master Lu will be

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
close to Nan Xing.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You!

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you know

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
where Master Lu and Nan Xiao Xing are?

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Master Xiao!

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's really Master Xiao!

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Master Xiao!

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master Xiao!

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We've finally

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
got you today!

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why are they so happy?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They even call me Master?

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I didn't expect to catch up with them today.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Catch up?

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah!

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're going to be on the list!

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hero!

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What does that mean?

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Because you're

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the hero of our Fairy Town!

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right,

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Master Xiao.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you hadn't helped the town

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and caught the villains,

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you wouldn't have saved our daughter.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How could we

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
have a peaceful life today?

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you, Master Xiao!

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We don't have

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
anything good to give you.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We just want to

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ask you to keep it!

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Keep it!

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait!

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Get up first.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Get up!

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm asking you.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is there any other hero

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
besides me?

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In our Fairy Town,

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
all the old and young

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
are under your care.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Who would dare to call himself a hero

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
when you're around?

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm a villain, aren't I?

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why is it different from what Nanxing wrote?

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't know.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is there a hero

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
in our Fairy Town?

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A hero?

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He has a right to be a hero.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A hero?

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've never heard of a hero.

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But he has a right to be a hero.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He seems to be over there.

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Over there?

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Which way?

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That way!

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Over there!

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That way!

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's about 30 miles away.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's go.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Xia!

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't go!

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mr. Xia!

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't go!

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Fairy, fairy.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Although we're not together,

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Nanxing is still waiting for me.

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please help me.

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Send me back.

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Send me back.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Send me back.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Send me back.

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Send me back.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Send me back.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Money.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Send me back.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Send me back.

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Send me back.

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Send me back.

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why...

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why isn't it working?

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Send me back.

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Send me back.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Send me back.

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Send me back.

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How can you send me back?

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you playing with me?

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Where did you save me?

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The water is so shallow.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How can I sink in it?

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Xiong.

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He's home, right?

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What did he say?

232
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He promised me that I can't be with you.

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Otherwise, I would withdraw all my investment.

234
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I hope that

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you can think about it

236
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
when you're not working

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and making decisions.

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can't handle some things.

239
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What else is there in a fresh meat wonton?

240
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
A sandwich.

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
A sandwich.

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's all?

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Twenty in total.

246
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Please scan the code.

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Dad, I'm leaving.

248
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Take care.

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Qin Qin,

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
let's go to the restaurant.

251
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you sure?

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not sure.

253
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not sure.

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not sure.

255
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not sure.

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not sure.

257
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not sure.

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you sure?

259
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course.

260
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I've been helping you since middle school.

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Stop bragging.

262
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's been years.

263
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm telling you, be careful.

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't spill the wonton.

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So you care about the wonton.

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What do you think?

267
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Le.

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Aunt.

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I know why you came.

271
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Though I have no idea

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
what happened specifically,

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I knew you would guess it right.

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm sorry.

275
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,080
My daughter, Qin Qing, has been very independent since she was little.

276
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
She has her own thoughts.

277
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Her dad and I have been working in this shop.

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,520
We didn't care much about her since she was little.

279
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,200
But no matter what, her life and studies were well managed.

280
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
She said she wanted to open a company for you.

281
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,560
Her dad was against it.

282
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,640
He said a girl doesn't need to work so hard.

283
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,680
But every time she came back full of energy,

284
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
she said you thought of this and that.

285
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
What have you done now?

286
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,440
We don't want her to work so hard.

287
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,200
But she's so persistent and happy.

288
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,880
What can her dad and I say against?

289
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
Lu.

290
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,760
If you really like Qin Qing,

291
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
just say it.

292
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,720
As a mother, I don't want to take care of a child who's not grown up like my daughter.

293
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,960
You haven't eaten yet, right?

294
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,480
Eat and then go.

295
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080
Thank you.

296
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,760
Eat before you leave. We're still busy.

297
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,100
California

298
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,480
Xiaodi.

299
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,320
I've made a daily record of us........

300
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Can you open your eyes and listen to the song in this scene?

301
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,920
I know you must be thinking of a way to come back.

302
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,320
I will be here waiting for you.

303
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,320
How can I end this dream?

304
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Waiting for the yearning to go away,

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
like a car that is so old.

306
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:32,320
The moment I woke up, I was afraid that my heart would break.

307
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,920
Let the story over the world.

308
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,320
Try to show you everything will be great.

309
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,720
Good morning, An Nanxing.

310
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
Good morning.

311
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,320
Good morning.

312
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,520
No need to worry.

313
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,720
Good morning, everyone.

314
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,520
Good morning, Miss Jiang.

315
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,120
Please stay by my side.

316
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,520
When the tide returns, Jiangbei will be full of hope.

317
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,120
We all will be the flower.

318
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,720
No matter why or black.

319
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,520
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

320
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,520
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

321
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

322
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,920
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

323
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,520
Boss, I'm calling the driver to drive the car over.

324
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,120
The moment I woke up, I was afraid that my heart would break.

325
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Let the story over the world.

326
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Try to show you everything will be great.

327
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
No need to worry.

328
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Good morning.

329
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,120
You're making a fool of me.

330
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Stop chasing.

331
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
Please stay by my side.

332
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,320
When the tide returns, Jiangbei will be full of hope.

333
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,920
We all will be the flower.

334
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,520
No matter why or black.

335
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,720
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

336
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,320
When I walk into the dark night,

337
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,120
please stay by my side.

338
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,320
When the tide returns, Jiangbei will be full of hope.

339
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
We all will be the flower.

340
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,520
No matter why or black.

341
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:56,720
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

342
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:06,320
I will be silent and think that the light will not go out.

343
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,320
Mom, I'm home.

344
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720
Be careful. Take a break and drink some milk.

345
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
Okay. Thank you, mom.

346
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,320
Be careful. It's hot.

347
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,720
Okay.

348
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,720
Why are you so late recently?

349
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,320
I have to accompany the boss to meet the investor during the day.

350
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,120
I don't have time to think about the plot.

351
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,720
I just came back and wrote something and it's already a mess.

352
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
I told you that your boss likes you.

353
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,520
He even brought you to meet the client.

354
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
I just went to help him with the factory.

355
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,320
I guess our boss is a bit guilty.

356
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,520
Mr. Ye was in charge of all these things before.

357
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Isn't he resigned now?

358
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,520
Why did he resign?

359
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,720
Did they have a fight?

360
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,520
I know. Because you are too good.

361
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,720
Right.

362
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,920
Look, I guessed it right.

363
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,120
Go back and sleep. I'll sleep after I finish writing.

364
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,520
Okay. Don't be too late.

365
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Okay.

366
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,920
By the way, why haven't you seen Xiao Xiong recently?

367
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,920
He went back to his hometown.

368
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,520
You don't even say that.

369
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

370
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Okay.

371
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,720
Go to sleep early.

372
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,520
Good night.

373
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Okay.

374
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,920
President Lu, let me tell you this.

375
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,720
About the investment,

376
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,120
I was talking to Ye Qing about it.

377
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,320
I know how much effort he put in in X Culture.

378
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,720
So I won't lie to you.

379
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
I know you are meeting investors everywhere now.

380
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
But I can tell you clearly.

381
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Your efforts and efforts will not be enough.

382
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,720
It's better to give up now.

383
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,720
Why?

384
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,720
First, we agree with your idea.

385
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,320
Your dream is great.

386
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,520
Your goal is meaningful.

387
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,120
But you know,

388
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,120
in this world, what's missing is not a dream.

389
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,120
It's people who can turn dreams into reality.

390
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,320
For X Culture,

391
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,720
this person is Ye Qing, not you.

392
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,920
Second, you shouldn't kick your dad out.

393
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,520
This money is not big,

394
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
but as long as he is here,

395
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,920
everyone will know that behind this company

396
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,320
there is a huge business value supporting it.

397
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,120
Now Ye Qing is gone,

398
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,720
you don't need your dad's support.

399
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
As an investor,

400
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I find your performance now is very unreasonable.

401
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,120
I know.

402
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
I know.

403
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,720
It seems we don't need to talk anymore.

404
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,720
Thank you for your honesty.

405
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,320
Sir, we are at the north gate of this building.

406
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,920
We are waiting for you at the door.

407
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,120
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

408
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,720
Boss, the car will be here soon.

409
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,520
Go cancel the future appointment.

410
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,320
You don't see them anymore?

411
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,520
He is right.

412
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,920
This money is not a big deal.

413
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
I can cancel it myself.

414
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,320
Have you figured it out?

415
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,520
Go find an agent to help me get the house out.

416
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,920
What?

417
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Why don't you think about it again?

418
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,120
Selling the house for this kind of thing is not worth it.

419
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,520
No need to say anymore.

420
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,920
Besides, be careful, I'll give you a holiday.

421
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,120
Let's go.

422
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,120
Okay, hang it up.

423
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,920
You can talk about the price.

424
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
The sooner the better.

425
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,320
I'll go to the third room.

426
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Don't forget the coriander.

427
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm leaving.

428
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,320
I'm busy.

429
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Mr. Ye.

430
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,320
Are you busy today?

431
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,720
Yes, what's up?

432
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,920
I have something to tell you.

433
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
One bowl?

434
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,720
Can I come to you when you are free?

435
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
How about this?

436
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Come and help me after work, okay?

437
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,920
Okay.

438
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,720
Bye.

439
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,120
Okay, bye.

440
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,920
Sir, wonton.

441
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,320
Sit down.

442
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,120
Qin Qian, clean this up first.

443
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,720
Okay.

444
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,520
Here's your wonton.

445
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,920
Okay, sit over there.

446
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,120
Hello, sit here.

447
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,520
Sit down.

448
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay, thank you.

449
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Here you are.

450
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Yes, yes, yes.

451
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Full house, right?

452
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Full house is 18 yuan.

453
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,920
Okay, what do you want?

454
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Fresh shrimp, big bowl, small bowl.

455
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,320
Coming.

456
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
Small bowl, fresh shrimp.

457
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,320
Mr. Ye.

458
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,120
Don't stand there, come and help.

459
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,320
Don't stand there, come and help.

460
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,520
What do you want?

461
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,920
Fresh shrimp and big bowl.

462
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,720
Big bowl, right?

463
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,920
This is my parents, Nanxing.

464
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,320
Hello, uncle.

465
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
Hello.

466
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
There are too many people today.

467
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,720
Thank you for coming to help.

468
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,920
It's okay.

469
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Nanxing,

470
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,520
send these two bowls of wonton to the right.

471
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
The second one is the most inside.

472
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Go.

473
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,720
I don't know how to work without this bag.

474
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,720
The third bowl, small bowl.

475
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,320
Small bowl.

476
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,520
Small bowl, 12 yuan.

477
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,120
Okay, okay.

478
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
And then?

479
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
Come on, let's compete for alcohol today.

480
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Why did you come here today?

481
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,720
Do you want to stay here?

482
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,920
I want to eat your barbecue.

483
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,520
Okay.

484
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
By the way, help me grill another eggplant.

485
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,120
Okay, wait a minute.

486
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,920
Okay.

487
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Try it.

488
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Mr. Ye.

489
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,720
You are really different from the company now.

490
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Have some tea.

491
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
See if it's delicious.

492
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
How is it?

493
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,520
It's so delicious.

494
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
When I was picking you up just now,

495
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
when you were making the wonton,

496
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,920
I felt so fragrant.

497
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Have one.

498
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
I eat it every day.

499
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
You eat it quickly.

500
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,720
And,

501
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,520
I am a homeless now.

502
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,320
So don't call me Mr. Ye.

503
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,520
No.

504
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
You are Mr. Ye.

505
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
You are Mr. Ye.

506
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,320
You work so hard in the restaurant

507
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,920
from morning to night.

508
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,120
Is it hard?

509
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,120
I am fine now.

510
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
It's all physical work.

511
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,320
Compared to the previous management company,

512
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,920
I am much easier now.

513
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,520
I don't have to wear high heels anymore.

514
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,120
I am not used to it.

515
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
If you are not used to it,

516
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
just take it off.

517
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,720
Now?

518
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,320
What's wrong with it now?

519
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Is it not okay?

520
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I will accompany you.

521
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,520
Come on.

522
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,720
Okay.

523
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I will take it off.

524
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,520
Is it much better?

525
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,520
It's still the same.

526
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,320
I will help you to pull it.

527
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,520
Okay. Thank you.

528
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,520
Tell me.

529
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
What's the matter?

530
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
The boss

531
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,120
wants to kick his dad out.

532
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,520
What do you mean?

533
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,920
The boss wants to buy all the shares

534
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
in his dad's hands.

535
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
And he can't touch the company's cash flow.

536
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
In this situation,

537
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
no one will take over.

538
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,520
He doesn't have so much cash flow.

539
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,520
So he hung up the house.

540
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
The agent said

541
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,520
his house is a good house

542
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,720
and easy to sell.

543
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
It should be sold in a few days.

544
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,120
Although the boss didn't say it,

545
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I think

546
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,320
at least he should resign from your job.

547
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I just want

548
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,920
you to go back and persuade him.

549
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Maybe there is still a chance to get back on your feet.

550
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,120
Okay.

551
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
You are mature now.

552
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,120
Really?

553
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,320
But now

554
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,120
I am no longer an employee of X Culture.

555
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
I don't have the position to question this matter.

556
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Okay.

557
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
Then I will come here today

558
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,920
to give the money to the boss.

559
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I will work all day.

560
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I welcome you to work here at any time.

561
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
You can eat and eat, but you can't pay.

562
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,520
I can drink, right?

563
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,320
That's good.

564
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
Try this.

565
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,520
It's super delicious.

566
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,920
Boss wants to buy all the shares in his dad's hands

567
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
and can't touch the company's cash flow.

568
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,920
So he hung up the house.

569
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,520
What does this mean?

570
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,920
This is a fake.

571
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
This is a fake.

572
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,120
This is a fake.

573
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
This is a fake.

574
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,920
What does this mean?

575
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I heard that you are going to kick your dad out of the game.

576
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Why is it so sudden?

577
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Sorry.

578
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I am late.

579
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,720
Time is up.

580
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Happy السerie after the paper Text

581
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:26,380
The

582
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,140
IP project

583
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,240
How can i reply this

584
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I'm so happy to have the secret weapon that Mr. Ye gave me.

585
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
When will Mr. Ye come back?

586
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Even if he gave me the secret weapon,

587
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
I can't handle so many problems by myself.

588
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
My little star.

589
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Teacher Shen.

590
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
The new star project's board is missing you two.

591
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Did you forget?

592
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I have to finish it before the holiday.

593
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Tell me when you have an appointment with Xiao Wu Li.

594
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Hello.

595
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Hello, Miss.

596
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,120
I'm the agent who entrusted you to sell the house.

597
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
I want to inform you that

598
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,120
your Mr. Lu's house has been found.

599
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
So fast?

600
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
It's only a few days.

601
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
The house is very hot now.

602
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Especially your Mr. Lu's big flat house is very popular.

603
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
The price is very beautiful.

604
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I'm sorry.

605
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
I'm sorry.

606
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
I'm sorry.

607
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm sorry.

608
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I'm sorry.

609
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
I'm sorry.

610
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm sorry.

611
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm sorry.

612
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
The price is very beautiful.

613
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Please inform your Mr. Lu again.

614
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Okay, I see.

615
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Thank you.

616
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
You're welcome.

617
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Boss.

618
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
The agent just called.

619
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
He said the house has been sold.

620
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I'll leave it to him.

621
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Mr. Lu.

622
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Mr. Lu, he...

623
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
What did he say?

624
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
He called to say that

625
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
the money to buy back the shares

626
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
is not enough.

627
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
He said that

628
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
What did he say?

629
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
He called to say that

630
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
the money to buy back the shares

631
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
is ready.

632
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
I asked around.

633
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
He seemed to have taken out all the cash

634
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
and sold the house.

635
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Do you think I should persuade him?

636
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
No.

637
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Why do you persuade him?

638
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
It's rare to have a chance.

639
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Follow him.

640
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Okay.

641
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
He sold the house.

642
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
He's a good guy.

643
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Boss.

644
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
This is the contract you want.

645
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
And the information.

646
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Boss.

647
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,120
I think you're a little too...

648
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Do you want to eat?

649
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
No, no.

650
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I just want to say

651
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
I'm a little too impulsive.

652
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
I've thought about the consequences.

653
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
It's good for our company

654
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
to be completely independent.

655
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Those people don't cooperate with us

656
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
because of my dad.

657
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
That can only explain

658
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
that we're not on the same side.

659
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
You can buy the house again.

660
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
It's not like you can't afford it.

661
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I...

662
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
You've had a hard time these days.

663
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
You should get off work early today.

664
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
You have to rest tomorrow.

665
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Okay.

666
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
What happened recently

667
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
is a matter of life for the company.

668
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Okay, I know.

669
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
I've already told the boss.

670
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
You can arrange the specific time.

671
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Okay.

672
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
If you need anything, you can talk to me.

673
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Okay, okay.

674
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Thank you.

675
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Teacher Shi.

676
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
I've read the cover of my book.

677
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I need to change two parts.

678
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I'll send you the file.

679
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Okay.

680
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Xiao Xin.

681
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Mom, have some water.

682
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Okay.

683
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
You've been talking on the phone all night.

684
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
It's too hard to talk about work.

685
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
I've had a lot of things lately.

686
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
I found that since Mr. Ye left,

687
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
you've been different.

688
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
No.

689
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
No.

690
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I'm a carefree person.

691
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
I think you're now

692
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
like a strong woman.

693
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
You're exaggerating.

694
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm not familiar with many businesses.

695
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I have to point out

696
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Mr. Ye's assistant's secret to me.

697
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

698
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
You have to take it slow.

699
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
You know?

700
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
You have to work hard.

701
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
I know.

702
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,120
How about I take you out for a few days on weekends?

703
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
To change your mood.

704
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
I have to work overtime on weekends.

705
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Okay, okay.

706
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Then you can go out with your sisters.

707
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
That's the only way.

708
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
I'm telling you.

709
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Physical strength is the foundation of revolution.

710
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Don't tire yourself out.

711
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,120
This is the same as the WeChat profile photo you sent me.

712
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's new.

713
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
I'll send it to you later.

714
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Okay.

715
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Okay, go ahead.

716
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Xiao Wu Di.

717
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,060
Sell them now.

718
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm running with you

719
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,120
You are the bridge that I've walked alone in the heaven

720
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Accompany me

721
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Occasionally, I'm in your round smile

722
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Maybe it's the atmosphere

723
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,120
My hero can always catch up with me in time

724
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Drive away all my troubles

725
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,120

Maybe this represents my heart

729
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Lay lay lay lay lay lay oh every sunset

730
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,120

00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,120
If you like me, I'll be your hero

733
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Let's go now

734
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Turn a few turns of the sun to bring a new day

735
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
I'm running with you

736
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,120
You are the bridge that I've walked alone in the heaven

737
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120

My hero can always catch up with me in time

741
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,120

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,120
