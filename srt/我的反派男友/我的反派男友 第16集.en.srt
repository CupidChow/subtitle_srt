[Episode 16]

4
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,910
Come, let's take a picture.

5
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,820
Hurry.

6
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,210
It looks great.

7
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,820
One, two, three.

8
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,620
Come on, let's take another one.

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,300
Look at my Sparkler.

10
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,700
It's changing colours!

11
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,660
Yeah, you're right.

12
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,250
I want that too.

13
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,539
Come, let's enjoy it together.

14
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,660
Come on!

15
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,100
This is great.

16
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,390
This looks amazing!

17
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,030
This is awesome!

18
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,259
It's so nice!

19
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,140
It's great.

20
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,259
Boss, come here and join us.

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,820
Boss.

22
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,780
You guys can go ahead.

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,460
Boss, come on.

24
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
This won't do.

25
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,040
Come on.

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,030
Boss, you're such a boring person.

27
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,700
Go and take pictures with them.

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,940
I want to take it from this angle too.

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,600
Let me do it.

30
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,500
Here, take a Sparkler.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,100
Three, two, one.

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,540
It's starting.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,460
It looks great!

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,340
Did you snap the fireworks?

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,780
Did you?

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,040
Look at the fireworks!

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,900
I've already made up my mind.

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,140
Let's be together.

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,740
I know.

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,430
I was too timid before this.

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,180
I didn't dare to express myself.

42
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,020
But now, I no longer wish to be timid.

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,900
I like you.

44
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,640
Let's be together.

45
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,440
What's wrong? Why are you keeping quiet?

46
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,980
Are you sure about that?

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,740
Yeah.

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,180
This time, I'll bear

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,580
all of the consequences.

50
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,060
You cannot bear this

51
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
alone.

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,220
Whether we become a couple

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,860
or not

54
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,670
no longer concerns you alone.

55
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,740
We can never return to the past

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,500
after you say that.

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,260
Before this, I gave you hints

58
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,020
that I couldn't

59
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,150
resolve this issue.

60
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,840
But now,

61
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,310
you still brought it up.

62
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,260
Right now,

63
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,060
I don't know how to answer you.

64
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,500
If I say yes,

65
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,150
does that mean we need to be together,

66
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,260
get into an office relationship,
and get married?

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,420
I don't know

68
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,780
if I can accept it.

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
However, if I say no,

70
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,980
does that mean

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,690
I have to lose

72
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,950
one of my best friends?

73
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,280
No matter what you say,

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,220
you will never lose me.

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,530
[And, don't you think this male lead]

76
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,010
[is too imprudent?]

77
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,890
[He appeared out of nowhere,]

78
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,950
[and he could disappear at any time.]

79
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,100
[Even so, he still dares
to court female lead.]

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
[Don't you think he's too selfish?]

81
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,140
Hello?

82
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,460
[Hello.]

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,060
[This is the ceramic shop.]

84
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,460
[Your product is ready.]

85
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,670
[I thought you were supposed
to retrieve it before sunset?]

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,580
I...

87
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,460
I think I'll skip it for today.

88
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,700
[I'm not referring to the one]

89
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,260
[you made together
with your girlfriend today.]

90
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,420
[It was the one you made by yourself]

91
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,950
[when you came yesterday.]

92
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,350
You can leave it there for now. Thanks.

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,170
[Xiao Wudi, help!]

94
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,380
[There's a crook!]

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,659
[Xiao Wudi, come here!]

96
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,760
[There's a crook!]

97
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,400
What's the matter?

98
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,020
What happened?

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,240
Where's the crook?

100
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,980
Aren't you the crook?

101
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,140
Why did you

102
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,659
summon me out of the blue?

103
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,220
It's because I wanted to see you.

104
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,940
I'm busy.

105
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,540
I need to head back for now.

106
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,270
Xiao Wudi, you'll get a headache
if you ignore me!

107
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,900
Xiao Wudi,

108
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,380
I like you.

109
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,650
Nan Xing, I cannot

110
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,980
be together with you.

111
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,300
But why?

112
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,300
I don't have an identity
in the current era.

113
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,030
And, I appeared out of nowhere.

114
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,110
I might disappear out of nowhere too.

115
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,280
But you're different.

116
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,100
Nan Xing,

117
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,740
you need a clear future.

118
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,180
You won't get a future

119
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,780
if you become my girlfriend.

120
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,660
In the past, I was selfish

121
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,620
as I thought

122
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,060
you could bear the consequences
by yourself.

123
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,660
But now, I realize

124
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,660
that I can be selfish
to anyone in the world,

125
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,980
except for you.

126
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,480
That's why I cannot be together with you.

127
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,140
In the future...

128
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,500
I thought you had panic disorder?

129
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,640
But this is a sacred place
for love confessions.

130
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,660
That's why

131
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,240
I wish to gather my courage
and tell you this.

132
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,260
Xiao Wudi,

133
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,870
I've already lost the people I loved once.

134
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,620
As for the future,

135
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,690
let's leave it to the future us,

136
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,620
okay?

137
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,600
This time, I wish to cherish the present.

138
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,580
If I miss out on the present,

139
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,730
I will regret it

140
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,020
no matter what happens

141
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,780
in the future.

142
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,780
Xiao Wudi.

143
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,880
Will you become my boyfriend?

144
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,540
Okay.

145
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,740
The fireworks are awesome!

146
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,410
Hurry up!

147
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,220
Okay!

148
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,860
Let's go!

149
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,610
Let's go!

150
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,460
It's over.

151
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,370
So,

152
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,860
shall we continue

153
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,380
with our...

154
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,900
You mean now?

155
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,780
Isn't it a little...

156
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,180
I guess so.

157
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,130
What are you laughing at?

158
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
I thought you were great at that.

159
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,900
Wait, what do you mean by that?

160
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,260
Explain yourself.

161
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,300
I, Young Master Hehuan,

162
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,540
am a master at everything.

163
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,270
It's just...

164
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,300
So, you want to argue with me

165
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,630
on the first day of our relationship, huh?

166
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,290
[No matter what you say,]

167
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,860
you will never lose me.

168
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,800
Why must you

169
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,150
make it so complicated?

170
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,980
Think about the past.

171
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,180
There were only the two of us

172
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,060
when we first started our business.

173
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,660
Back then,

174
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,060
we were together 24/7.

175
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,620
If we become a couple right now,

176
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,500
everything will be the same.

177
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Isn't that great?

178
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,860
What if we break up?

179
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,180
If you're worried

180
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,210
that you might lose your career,

181
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,660
I can promise you this.

182
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,860
I'll leave the company after our breakup.

183
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,740
How?

184
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,420
Your works, dreams,

185
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,580
and your entire fortune

186
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,820
are in this company.

187
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,100
What would the employees think

188
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,900
if you leave the company?

189
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,140
I couldn't care less about them.

190
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,470
But I do care about them.

191
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,150
Do you have no confidence in me?

192
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,660
Let's treat it as if

193
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,020
this encounter never took place, okay?

194
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,540
Hey.

195
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,540
Wait here for me.

196
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,080
What's the matter?

197
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,060
Give me a second.

198
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,260
Stay there.

199
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,100
Is this for me?

200
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,320
Open it and have a look.

201
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,500
This is a figure of you
that I made myself.

202
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,230
It's for you.

203
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,180
I hope

204
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,580
that when you listen

205
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,100
to this wind chime,

206
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,300
it'll feel like the sound of my heartbeat.

207
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,030
I will always stay by your side.

208
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,660
Do you like it?

209
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,860
I do.

210
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,740
So,

211
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,800
you should rest early.

212
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,430
I'll make a move now.

213
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,740
You're leaving already?

214
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,300
If so, I...

215
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,480
I can stay here if you like.

216
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,180
That's not it.

217
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,540
I meant,

218
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,670
what about the thing

219
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,600
we were doing just now?

220
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:21,900
Okay.

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,980
Nan Xing, are you back?

222
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,100
This is strange.

223
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,220
I heard her voice.

224
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,900
But where is she?

225
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
She's not back yet? Look at the time!

226
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,660
Why did you run away?

227
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,930
You were the one who ran away first.

228
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,060
You dragged me with you.

229
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,350
Are you okay?

230
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm fine.

231
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,060
Miss Jiao is a busybody.

232
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,120
If she finds out

233
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,460
that we're a couple,

234
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,920
the entire company

235
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,180
will hear about it by tomorrow morning.

236
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,730
So,

237
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,350
I think we should keep our distance

238
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,110
whenever

239
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,100
there's a crowd.

240
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,860
You women

241
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,560
are cold-blooded indeed.

242
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,700
You don't cherish things
once you get them.

243
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,830
What are you saying?

244
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,340
Alright.

245
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,980
You should head back and rest now.

246
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,230
Goodnight.

247
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,290
Goodnight.

248
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,220
Xiao Wudi.

249
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,369
Goodbye.

250
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,820
You didn't wait for me.

251
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,660
I thought someone said

252
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,460
we should keep our distance?

253
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,740
Xiao Wudi.

254
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,420
Xiao Wudi, do you want to chat?

255
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Are you asleep?

256
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
I shouldn't have

257
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,460
told him to keep our distance.

Let's go.

278
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,540
Should we tell her?

279
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,140
You don't plan to tell her again?

280
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,620
Again? That sounds hurtful.

281
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,140
It's fine.

282
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,620
If you don't have the guts to tell her,

283
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,420
I'll tell Aunt An on your behalf.

284
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,860
No!

285
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,900
This is so sudden.

286
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,020
Why don't

287
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,300
we tell her when our relationship

288
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,160
is more stable?

289
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,060
What do you mean by that?

290
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Isn't our relationship stable now?

291
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,780
So,

292
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,800
you had a change of heart already?

293
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,660
That's not it.

294
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,300
My mother is a part of
the older generation.

295
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,900
Their concept of stability

296
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,580
is different from ours.

297
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,190
What's the difference?

298
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,700
I thought Aunt An always wanted you

299
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,860
to get a boyfriend?

300
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,170
And now,

301
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,500
if she realized

302
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,220
that you found yourself
such an outstanding boyfriend,

303
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,880
she should be elated about it.

304
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,680
You don't understand.

305
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,620
The current elders and the elders
from the ancient era

306
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,420
have the same viewpoint

307
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,020
when it comes to this.

308
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
If you break the news to her

309
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,040
out of the blue,

310
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
my mother will surely act like this.

311
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,660
You two are a couple now?

312
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,100
That's great!

313
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,740
Xiong,

314
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,180
which company do you work for?

315
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Where did you come from?
Where are you staying right now?

316
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,940
How long have you two been together?

317
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,860
Only one day?

318
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,660
When will you guys get married then?

319
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,390
I'll follow your instruction.

320
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,100
About this,

321
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,380
I think we should

322
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,380
talk about it
when our relationship is stable.

323
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,260
Yeah, right?

324
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,500
You better don't give yourself away.

325
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,230
Don't worry.

326
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,290
Mum, I'm back.

327
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,220
You're back?

328
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,010
How was it?

329
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,380
How did the PEN congress go?

330
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,990
It went smoothly.

331
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,670
It's just a PEN congress.

332
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,140
There's nothing difficult about it.

333
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,270
We had fun together.

334
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,740
The venue was gorgeous.

335
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,140
I'll bring you there next time.

336
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,670
Alright.

337
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,980
You didn't post it on social media.

338
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,780
That's why I thought

339
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,110
the place was terrible.

340
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,260
I forgot about it as I was too busy.

341
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,780
Are you making dumplings?

342
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,220
Yeah.

343
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,480
I wanted to prepare a welcoming feast
for you and Xiong.

344
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,740
I thought Xiong

345
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,060
joined you on your trip?

346
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,590
Why did you come back alone?

347
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,950
He came back as well.

348
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,990
Where is he then?

349
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,540
He's at home.

350
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,260
Invite him here then.

351
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,460
I prepared enough for three people.

352
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,020
I don't think that's appropriate.

353
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,180
He just came back.

354
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,300
I shouldn't go and interrupt him.

355
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,380
Why is it not appropriate?

356
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,720
It's not your first time doing it anyway.

357
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,720
What's the matter?

358
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,060
Could it be that there's something
between you two?

359
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,810
Of course not.

360
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,690
If so, you should bring him here.

361
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,020
Ask him to lend us a hand.

362
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,580
Sure, I'll go fetch him.

363
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,300
What should we do?

364
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,020
Can't you

365
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,740
just stay calm for a second?

366
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,940
Why don't I tell my mother

367
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,860
that you fell asleep

368
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,120
out of exhaustion?

369
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,660
Let's just go.

370
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,740
This isn't

371
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,900
my first time having a meal
at your house anyway.

372
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,300
It's not something unnatural.

373
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,100
You're right.

374
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,620
It's not your first time
having a meal with us.

375
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,350
It's not something unnatural.

376
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,060
If I don't go there tonight,

377
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,140
we won't be able
to survive until tomorrow.

378
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,980
That's right.

379
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,780
If you don't come tonight,

380
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,780
she'll find out about it by tonight.

381
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,830
Let's go.

382
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,230
What's the matter?

383
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,230
Give me a hug.

384
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:42,980
Nan Xing,

385
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,240
why did you take so long

386
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,620
to invite him?

387
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Were you two

388
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,380
working out just now?

389
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,620
Enough already.

390
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,640
Xiong, come on.

391
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,260
Follow me.

392
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,820
What are you doing?

393
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,140
What are you doing?

394
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,820
Can't you act normally for once?

395
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,020
Speak for yourself.

396
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,580
Xiong,

397
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,220
you don't know
how to make dumplings, right?

398
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,020
Nan Xing

399
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,980
is good at making dumplings since young.

400
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,140
She's an expert at making dumplings.

401
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,260
Nan Xing can teach you how to make them.

402
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,520
-He doesn't...
-Sure.

403
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,730
I may not know how to make them,

404
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,260
but I'm a fast learner.

405
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,620
I think Nan Xing

406
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
can be my teacher.

407
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,380
I'll make some dough.

408
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,910
Use this.

409
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,500
Okay.

410
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,340
Didn't I tell you to keep your distance?

411
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,270
Didn't I tell you to act naturally?

412
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,860
Aunt An,

413
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
we'll make them

414
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,620
outside.

415
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,340
Sure.

416
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,660
Come.

417
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,500
How should we go about this?

418
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,100
Let me teach you.

419
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,410
First, take a piece of dough.

420
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,460
Take around one spoonful of filling.

421

♫ To go through the difficulties ♫

428

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,180
Tell her that
you didn't take any pictures.

516
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,700
Mum,

517
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,930
I don't know why

518
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,110
♫ Maybe they represent my heart ♫

519
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,360
my phone is dying on me.

520
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,780
If so, I'm sure

521
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,380
Xiong has them on his phone, right?

522
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,340
Show them to me.

523
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,160
♫ Every sunset ♫

524
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,820
Check them.

525
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,570
♫ The next sunrise that I've promised ♫

526
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,120
Aunt An, I'll try to find them.

527
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,530
♫ Unknowingly got close,
our tacit understanding ♫

528
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,590
-♫ Be your warrior if you like it ♫
-♫ Be my warrior if you like it ♫

529
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,180
Since when did you use this
as your screensaver?

530
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,580
♫ Let's depart now ♫

531
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,620
No way.

532
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,540
We'll be done for if Mum sees this.

533
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,140
Change it.

534
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,420
No.

535
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,640
I'll change it back for you tomorrow.

536
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,660
Is it that difficult
to find some pictures?

537
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,860
Come, show them to me.

538
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,130
It's locked.

539
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,430
Unlock it for me.

540
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,740
Goodness.

541
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,580
This picture is...

542
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,420
It looks awesome.

543
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:03,940
Mum,

544
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,500
I'll bring you there next time.

545
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
It's a promise then.
Remember to bring me there.

546
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,700
Okay.

547
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,660
I think the soup is overflowing.

548
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,340
My pot!

549
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,510
Let's go!

550
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,140
Where are you two going?

551
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,140
We suddenly

552
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,540
came up with some ideas for our novel.

553
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,940
We have to jot them down.

554
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
The dumplings are going to be cooked soon.

555
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,460
I'll deliver them to him
once they're ready.

556
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,900
You guys should leave
after finishing them.

557
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,760
We'll have them when we come back.

558
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,940
She didn't follow us.

559
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,570
I think

560
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,480
she almost found out just now.

561
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,340
You should be more careful
when you're at home.

562
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,100
You were being too obvious about it.

563
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,460
I got it.

564
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,470
We're done for.

565
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Even the stairway

566
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,340
isn't safe now.

567
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,510
She can see everything through
the peephole.

568
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,300
Our community is unsafe as well.

569
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
She will pass by us from time to time.

570
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,220
It'll be fine.

571
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,980
I think I should head home for now.

572
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,660
Let's contact each other
through WeChat then.

[Xiong,]

597
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,900
which company do you work for?

Where did you come from?
Where are you staying right now?

Only one day?

When will you two get married?

I'll follow your instruction.

about our relationship

Mum, I'll head out now.

I know I told you not to send me to work,
