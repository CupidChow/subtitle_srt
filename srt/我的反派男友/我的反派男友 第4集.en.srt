Why are we here?

6
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,490
You still don't get it?

7
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,009
Get what?

The rule of summoning.

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,090
Now I am more confused.

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,410
The first time I summoned you,

11
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,380
I was in an embarrassing situation.

12
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,420
The second time,

13
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,900
I was in danger.

14
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,660
You said I needed

15
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,060
a hero who can save me.

16
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,750
But I didn't need saving

17
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,310
in either case just now.

18
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,010
Nothing happened.

19
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,579
I thought so at first.

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,579
But now I realise

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,470
that what really matters

22
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,120
is not the situation

23
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,820
you are in,

24
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,740
but the outcome after you summon me.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,329
Outcome?

26
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,760
[When you first summoned me,]

27
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,980
[I saved you from embarrassment.]

28

[I saved your life.]

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,460
[As for the third and fourth time,]

31
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,780
[I wiped your mouth]

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,579
[and gave you]

33
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,780
a shoulder to lean on.

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,990
Do you get it now?

35
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,820
No?

36
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,390
When you were embarrassed,

37
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,579
I saved you from embarrassment.

38
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,500
When you were in danger, I protected you.

39

40

Who is kidding here?

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,560
You have been deceiving me

48

49
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,680
And you were still deceiving me just now.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,410
What on earth

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,480

52

What else could I wish for?

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,460
Well, I said

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,850
I wanted

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,240
an unforgettable love.

56
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,160
What?

57
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,310
I wanted

58
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,610
an unforgettable love.

59
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,410
Do you need help

60
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,410
with that tongue?

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,090
Speak up.

62
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,060
I said I wanted

63
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,470
an unforgettable love.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,160
But I didn't know

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,630
why things

66
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,850
turn out like this.

67
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,880
Can you not stare at me like that?

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,080
Surveillance cameras are everywhere.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So you do know you are being watched.

70
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,510
Then how dare you make that wish?

71
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,490
I was triggered at that time.

72
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,930
So I just said it without much thought.

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,050
Did you know

74
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,779

75
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,180

I said it without much thought.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,370
How could I have thought
of the consequences?

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Very well.

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,860
Do you think someone like you

80
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,500
deserves an unforgettable love?

81
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,550
Stop dreaming.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,530
Why don't I deserve

83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,080

84
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,590

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,780
who would dream?

89

I don't take things
that don't belong to me.

92
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,790
I got a job to support myself.

93
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,590
Other than being single all my life,

94
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,020
do I have any flaws?

95

An unforgettable love?

96
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,200
Will I have to

97
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,130
fall for

98
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,600
a girl like that?

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,640
What a wishful thinking.

100
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,020
If she ever

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,580
pesters me again,

102
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,100

My career has just begun.

176
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,150
♫ Is love ♫

177
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,020
But you... You don't even have a job.

178
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,950
You don't even have an identity card.

179
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,500
Without it,

180
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,760
how can we register
our marriage in the future?

181
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
How can we register
the birth of our children?

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,620
Stop dreaming.

183
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,230
Did I say I wanted to
have children with you?

184
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,190
You don't want to have children?

185
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,420
This is not about me.

186
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,970
Didn't you say

187
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,490
you wanted an unforgettable love?

188
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,220
But you didn't say it must be me.

189
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,740
If I can find you a guy,

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,890
the job will be done.

191
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,420
You make a good point.

192
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,860
If you can find me a boyfriend,

193
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,920
your mission will be accomplished.

194
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,140
I hope so too.

195
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,830
But before that happens,

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,410
will I still be able

197
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,460
to summon you?

198
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,770
That is why we need to work quickly.

199
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,860
My patience

200
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
has a limit.

201
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,350
If I lose it one day...

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,860
You...

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,230
Why are you acting like a
vengeful spirit in search of victims?

204
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,830
This is exactly what it is.

205
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,190
We need to find a guy immediately.

206
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,940
And I can hand you over

207
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,990
to him.

208
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,010
Do you think no one fancy me?

209
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,600
Who?

210
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Who has the nerve?

211
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,370
Do you think I don't know

212
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,120
you're being sarcastic?

213
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,850
The males in my team

214
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,900
scream whenever they see me.

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,460
My popularity

216
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,020
is not something I want to brag about.

217
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,690
Fine.

218
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,670
Show me tomorrow.

219
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,240
Fine.

220
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,800
Tomorrow,

221
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240
don't forget to bring money.

222
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,250
I am going home.

223
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,760
It is still raining.

224
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,800
Give it to me.
That is my umbrella.

225
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,020
Why are you so slow?

226
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,220
Can you hurry up?

227
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,700
Xiao...

228
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,310
Surprise!

229
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,080
Mum?

230
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,080
Xiao...

231
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,310
He is so handsome.

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,800
Xiong.

233
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,190
Xiong?

234
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,660
Xiong.

235
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,590
Yes.

236
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,780
Mum, he is Xiong Sisi's cousin.

237
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,750
Xiong Wudi.

238
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,280
Hello, aunt.

239
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,110
You are Sisi's cousin?

240
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,160
I thought...

241
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,170
Well, what a coincidence.

242
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,230
Today is Nan Xing's first day at work.

243
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
I purposely rushed home

244
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,250
to cook a feast.

245
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:23,960
Join us.

246
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,660
Alright.

247
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,050
Come in.

248
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,310
Quick, come in.

249
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,120
Go back to Unit 302.

250
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,090
My mum will ask you...

251
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,670
Come in.

252
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,470
What was that about?

253
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,130
What do you want me to say?

254
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,170
I had to

255
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,600
give you a proper identity.

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,270
I can't say

257
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,350
the fairy sent you

258
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,620
from the past, can I?

259
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,930
True men don't change their first

260
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,480
or last names.

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,570
Haven't you heard of that?

262
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,870
Yes, I know.

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,050
But what is said is said.

264
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,010
What do you want me to say now?

265
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,610
That you are Xiong Xiao Wudi?

266
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,340
Wudi Bear?

267
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,420
Wudi Bear sounds fine actually.

268
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,130
Are you tired of living?

269
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,730
Mum.

270
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,080
What are you two doing?

271
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,410
He...

272
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
Come over and eat.

273
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,930
Start without me.

274
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,530
I'm going to cut some fruits.

275
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,190
The dish...

276
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,480
Eat up.

277
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,770
Don't you think

278
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
it tastes like...

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,420
Help yourself.

280
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,230
Is it good?

281
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,490
Yes, aunt.

282
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,500
Here. Have some fruits
to get rid of greasiness.

283
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,050
This is

284
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,430
Nan Xing's favourite.

285
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,400
You must try it.

286
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm going to clean up a bit.

287
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:03,880
Okay.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,130
Go ahead without me.

289
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,000
You don't want it?
What a picky eater.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,300
I don't eat oranges.

291
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,650
They taste weird.

292
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,240
Mum,

293
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,020
you didn't

294
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,420
wash your knife after cutting the chilli?

295
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I forgot it again.

296
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,630
I will get you some water.

297
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,080
Here. Drink some water.

298
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,550
Thanks, aunt.

299
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,260
Are you alright, Xiong?

300
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,150
I am fine.

301
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,300
How is the food?

302
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,320
They are so good.

303
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,900
Really?

304
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,080
Have some more.

305
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,630
Okay.

306
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,410
Here you go.

307
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,440
Xiong.

308
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,080
Where do

309
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,930
you live?

310
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,390
I live at the opposite unit.

311
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
Opposite this unit?

312
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,420
He just came to town.
He has no where to live.

313
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,180
So I rented Unit 302 to him.

314
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,000
Her dad left her that unit.

315
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,020
It has been vacant for many years.

316
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,110
We cleaned the place up

317
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,670
because we wanted to rent it out.

318
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,850
But you have moved in there?

319
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,770
Yes.

320
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,350
You're very efficient.

321
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,040
No, mum.

322
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,540
So,

323
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,690
what is your profession?

324
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,370
He...

325
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,590
I am not asking you.

326
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,960
I usually

327
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,580
help people

328
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,390
to find love.

329
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,940
I know.

330
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,170
You are a dating consultant, aren't you?

331
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,880
Right?

332
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,600
Then you should

333
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,110
be able to help Nan Xing

334
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,860
come up with a few strategies.

335
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,430
If it were up to her,

336
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,820
she would not be able to find a lover.

337
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,280
Mum.

338
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,260
Something smells like it's burnt.

339
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,520
Do you want to go and check it out?

340
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,160
Yes, I need to check it out.

341
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,420
Stop eating already.

342
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,480
Get going now.

343
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,650
Why?

344
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,670
Mum, he has to go.

345
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,010
I will see him to the door.

346
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,140
You are leaving now?

347
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,350
Join us again next time, Xiong.

348
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Don't take my mum's words

349
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,110
seriously.

350
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,310
Well,

351
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,330
do you feel

352
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,500
dizzy?

353
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,360
Nauseous?

354
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,770
Tightness in your chest?

355
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,190
Nothing?

356
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,490
That is weird.

357
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,550
Not many people can go home
without feeling sick

358
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,280
after eating my mum's cooking.

359
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,050
If you feel sick

360
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,890
at midnight,

361
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,460
call me.

362
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,300
I will send you some medicine.

363
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,030
Cut the crap.

364
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,140
Don't forget about tomorrow.

365
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,950
Tomorrow?

366
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,090
Find a replacement.

367
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,350
Did you really forget?

368
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,750
Are we really doing this?

369
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,070
See you tomorrow.

370
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,930
I think Xiong is not bad.

371
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,860
He is good-looking

372
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,380
and very courteous.

373
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,720
How do you know

374
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,190
he is courteous?

375
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,370
You think I don't know

376
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,050
how bad my cooking is?

377
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,820
Other than that brat,

378
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,110
I have never seen anyone

379
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
enjoy my food

380
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,150
so much.

381
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,130
What can this mean?

382
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,900
It means he is well bred.

383
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,470
It can also mean

384
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,800
he has a loss of taste.

385
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,160
Anyway, I think he is nice.

386
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,490
You should give him a thought.

387
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,460
He and I will never be together.

388
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,740
Why not?

389
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,010
If nothing will happen,
why did you rent the unit to him?

390
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,890
So many people

391
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,150
came to view the unit,

392
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,200
but you turned them all down.

393
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,750
So why are you renting it to him?

394
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,520
[What can I do?]

395
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,270
[I can't]

396
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
[let him stay in my room, right?]

397
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,560
This is a golden opportunity.

398
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,580
Take action when you have to.

399
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,340
Mum, I'm not in the mood

400
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,790
to think about that now.

401
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,120
Today is your first day at work.

402
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,840
Did your boss like you?

403
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,480
He didn't go to office.

404
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,880
That is normal.

405
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,420
Bosses are very busy.

406
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,200
They won't go to the office every day.

407
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Look at me.

408
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,550
I don't go to work every day too.

409
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:12,950
Right?

410
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,430
You have just started working.
So take it easy.

411
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,609
Get yourself familiar

412
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,040
with the company data,

413
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,680
the environment,

414
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,079
and your colleagues too.

415
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,619
But I didn't get to do all this.

416
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,000
Cheer up.

417
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,240
Don't forget

418
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,170
what you have learnt as an athlete.

419
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,280
Never abandon, never give up.

420
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,510
Alright, get some rest early.

421
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:38,850
Okay.

422
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,890
[For you. Just in case.]

423
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,730
[Indigestion and Stomachache]

424
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,760
I said I wanted

425
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,210
an unforgettable love.

426
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,010
[I will help her to find a lover]

427
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,960
[so that I can go back sooner.]

428
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,610
[For you. Just in case.]

429
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,360
Xiao Wudi?

430
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,310
He's not around?

431
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,110
I did call you.

432
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,380
I am leaving now.

433
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,380
Good morning.

434
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,600
You...

435
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,770
I was afraid I wouldn't wake up

436
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,490
if someone

437
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,030
called me in a low voice.

438
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,230
Actually,

439
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,470
what can you do if you come with me?

440
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,970
I want to hear

441
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,990
people screaming for you.

442
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,850
Do you have money with you?

443
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,180
Fried chicken! Snacks!

444
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,360
Thanks, Nan Xing.

445
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,970
Nan Xing, are they spicy?

446
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,170
Some are spicy.

447
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,060
Here. This bucket
has the original flavour.

448
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,860
Spicy ones are here.

449
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,000
You call this screaming?

450
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,510
Nan Xing,

451
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,720
why didn't you visit us lately?

452
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,250
I came before going to work.

453
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,410
Hey, handsome.

454
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,330
Would you like to join us
for some fried chicken?

455
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,920
Can I eat here then?

456
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,500
Sure. You definitely won't mind.

457
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,420
Nan Xing.

458
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,680
How are you doing

459
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,580
at your new job?

460
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,490
Don't be nervous.

461
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,640
I won't steal

462
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,000
my senior's boyfriend.

463
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,720
You mean me?

464
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,820
Don't misunderstand.

465
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,840
Nan Xing is pure and innocent.

466
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,380
Although she gets along well with boys,

467
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,460
they are just buddies.

468
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,340
It won't turn romantic.

469
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,200
Why so?

470
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,990
Because everyone likes

471
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,810
girls that normal people like.

472
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,480
What kind of girls

473
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,950
do normal people like?

474
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,970
Those who know
how to act like a spoiled child,

475
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,610
are feminine and gentle

476
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,420
and know how to dress up,

477
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,640
in every way

478
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,690
unlike Nan Xing.

479
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,750
Otherwise, she wouldn't

480
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,680
have remained single all her life.

481
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,240
Remained single all her life?

482
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,730
Change your perspective.

483
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,930
Maybe she is

484
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,410
waiting for you all along.

485
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,000
Right?

486
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,700
That is just so romantic.

487
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,220
By the way, handsome.

488
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,580
Do you know anyone

489
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,640
as handsome as you?

490
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,890
The less handsome ones are fine too.

491
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,620
I don't mind.

492
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,090
How about cousins on your father's side

493
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,350
or your mother's side?

494
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,200
Anyone like that?

495
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,990
Enjoy the food.

496
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,500
Sure.

497
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,650
Xiong Sisi.

498
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,430
I didn't do anything.

499
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,010
I was just chatting with him.

500
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,760
[With the way she is,]

501
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,370
[will I ever be able to
find a replacement?]

502
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,550
[Can I still leave this place?]

503
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,880
What did you chat about?

504
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,220
I wished you two happiness.

505
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,380
What?

506
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,090
He and I aren't in
that kind of relationship.

507
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,000
You don't have to hide it from me, Nan Xing.

508
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,170
He was the one who asked you
to borrow the tracksuit

509
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,970
the other day.

510
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,630
I was tailing him.

511
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,040
He is just my tenant.

512
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,630
I borrowed the tracksuit

513
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,220
for him

514
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,730
because of something that happened.

515
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,120
Stop imagining things.

516
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,340
Really?

517
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,810
I will pursue him then.

518
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,670
Come back here.

519
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,140
Are you tired of living?

520
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,630
What?

521
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,330
What are you talking about?

522
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,530
Listen.

523
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,040
From now on,

524
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,590
don't get too close to him.

525
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,770
If you run into him,

526
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
just turn around.

527
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,690
You hear me?

528
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,750
It is for your own good.

529
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,800
Fine.

530
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,890
I got it.

531
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,860
Also,

532
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,550
don't go to my place for now.

533
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,390
Don't let my mum see you.

534
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,820
Why?

535
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,330
Don't ask.

536
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,890
Eat up now.

537
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,800
The coach will be here soon.

538
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,300
Try this.

539
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,680
How about this?

540
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,900
What's wrong with you?

541
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,660
I am just wondering

542
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,130
if I can go back.

543
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,860
You must go back.

544
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,240
You must never

545
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,330
lose faith.

546
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,180
This isn't a good place.

547
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,040
We have air pollution and global warming.

548
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,970
Besides, the pace of life is too fast.

549
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,030
The past is better.

550
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,240
Alright. I get it.

551
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,590
Go to work first.

552
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,640
I will

553
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,980
figure something out.

554
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,220
Alright. I will get going now.

555
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,820
I almost forgot this.

556
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,750
Since you have moved into the unit,

557
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,980
my mum wants to buy
a new set of furniture for you.

558
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,570
Alright.

559
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,720
Xiao Wudi.

560
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,570
Go for it!

561
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,840
Never abandon, never give up.

562
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,390
Miss Jiao, good morning.

563
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,380
Nan Xing.

564
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,720
You are so early.

565
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,730
When I was

566
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,540
training,

567
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,620
I had to be even earlier.

568
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,460
I am used to it already.

569
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,470
Where did you

570
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,900
get so many flowers?

571
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,810
You seem to be quite romantic.

572
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,840
Miss Jiao, good morning.

573
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,470
Good morning.

574
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,100
Good morning.

575
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,980
I saw some flowers

576
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,310
on the table yesterday.

577
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,630
Although they weren't mine,

578
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,380
seeing them

579
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,680
made me happy.

580
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,030
So I thought I should

581
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,910
get everyone some.

582
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,460
I hope

583
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,640
I can perform well.

584
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,330
Miss Jiao, this is for you.

585
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
It is so pretty.

586
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
Thanks, Nan Xing.

587
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,900
Miss Jiao.

588
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,440
What can I do today?

589
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,420
Chu.

590
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,560
Didn't you say

591
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,280
you need Nan Xing's help?

592
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,800
I have

593
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,020
some receipts here.

594
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,550
I need them pasted on paper.

595
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,710
When you are doing it,

596
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,540
feel free to

597
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,650
ask me anytime

598
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,470
if you have any question.

599
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,630
Sure, no problem.

600
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,550
Do it well.

601
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,080
Miss Jiao.

602
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,540
Please take a look at this.

603
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,400
Let me see.

604
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,610
Chu, this is for you.

605
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,350
Yu Fan, I will place this here.

606
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,570
I am allergic to flowers.

607
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,620
Give it to Chu.

608
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,430
Thank you.

609
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,100
This kid is quite diligent.

610
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,280
It will be a pity

611
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,770
if she is fired.

612
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,020
Based on the way our boss
treats his assistants,

613
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,220
she won't last a week.

614
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,600
What do you mean?

615
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,440
A day.

616
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,960
Boss is coming to the office today.

617
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,600
Good morning, Boss.

618
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Good morning.

619
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,660
You are an athlete?

620
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,600
Never abandon, never give up.

621
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,450
So why did you give up

622
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,830
on being an athlete?

623
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,140
I...

624
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,490
Why are you still here?

625
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,180
Boss.

626
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,950
She is your new assistant.

627
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,200
Her name is Nan Xing.

628
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,970
Miss Ye has interviewed her.

629
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,540
I am doomed.

630
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,550
I froze again.

631
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,880
Boss must surely be mad.

632
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,750
Nan Xing, don't be too worried.

633
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,160
Since I think

634
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,820
this is probably the last.

635
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,810
What's with that assistant?

636
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,820
Didn't we agree about hiring an assistant?

637
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,680
I made the call.

638
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,630
She can't even say a word.

639
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,330
How can she be an assistant?

640
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,420
I hired her

641
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,410
to help you,

642
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,930
not to talk to you.

643
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,450
Besides,
that girl is gutsy and meticulous.

644
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,500
She is very persistent

645
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,920
and also a long-time fan of yours.

646
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,890
She knows you very well.

647
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,290
She should be able to
tolerate your temper.

648
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,220
You know

649
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,520
you need help,

650
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,230
but you can't keep
changing your assistant.

651
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,470
Give her some time.

652
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,580
One week.

653
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,350
After one week,

654
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
if she can't change
my impression of her...

655
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,530
I will fire her.

656
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,940
Take my breakfast.

657
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,370
I didn't know you were coming today.

658
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,090
So I didn't get

659
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,290
your favourite milk.

660
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,070
Your boyfriend I met last time,

661
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,160
what is his name again?

662
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,080
Song Jiaming.

663
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,760
So when

664
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,350
did you guys start dating?

665
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,410
Recently.

666
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,760
How did you know him?

667
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,570
While playing golf.

668
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,990
We are going to play golf this weekend.

669
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,650
You want to join us?

670
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,530
I don't like to play golf.

671
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:33,950
Right.

672
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,400
Do you really need a boyfriend?

673
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,120
Mr. Lu.

674
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,800
I am a human.

675
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,350
I need to live my life.

676
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,360
I am not

677
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,930
a working machine
that the company bought.

678
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,560
I...

679
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,050
That is not what I meant.

680
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,950
The contract is ready.

681
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,210
You can sign it now.

682
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,400
[Ye]

683
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,210
Thanks.

684
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,170
You like it?

685
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,260
Here you go.

686
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,260
The necklace looks nice.

687
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,170
It is a birthday gift.

688
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,240
Mr. Lu.

689
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,640
Have you signed it?

690
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,370
I need to get changed.

691
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,260
[Nan Xing.]

692
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,890
[You must have left him]

693
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,290
[with a bad impression.]

694
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,530
[What should I do to redeem myself?]

695
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,500
Hello, Boss.

696
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,700
[What should I do?]

697
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,730

[Don't be nervous.]

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,580
[Do it as you normally would.]

703
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,050
Are you alright?

704
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,890
[Nan Xing, what are you doing?]

705
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,150
[Are you insane?]

706
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,340
[You should have just kept quiet
if you are doing this.]

707
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,230
I will be writing at home this week.

708
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,380
If you have nothing to do,

709
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,220
you can either stay here

710
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,100
or go home.

[No. I won't be able to
hold the job this way.]

Don't act like a stranger.

713
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,090
I can accompany you at your home.

714
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,500
I can manage it myself.

715

[Dear God.]

[Just kill me.]

[No.]

[do normal people like?]

722
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,250
Those who know
how to act like a spoiled child,

723
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,560
are feminine and gentle

724
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,240
and know how to dress up,

725
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,580
in every way

726
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,720
unlike Nan Xing.

727
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,960
She is obviously not that kind of girls.

728
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,500
What should I do?

729
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,780
You have parcels.

730
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,460
Where do you want me to put them?

731
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,000
Here.

732
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,840
Okay.

733
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,610
Replace the old television

734
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,540
with the new one.

735
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,750
And change the curtains

736
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,010
in the living room too.

737
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,310

00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,680
This will be charged differently.

739
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,750
Sure, I will immediately install them.

Thanks.

741
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,850
You are welcome.

742

Miss Jiao.

743
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,110
It's been a day.

744
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,960
Should we check on her?

745
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,600
I think we should.

746
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,990
Let's go.

747
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,130
Nan Xing.

748
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,610
Miss Jiao.

749
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,590
Workplace newbies

750
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,290
tend to make some mistakes.

751
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,230
Besides,

752
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,000
you just hit the boss a little.

753
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,590
It isn't a big deal.

754
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,240
Did you all hit him too?

755
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,970
No.

756
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,980
We didn't.

757
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,190
Then it will be over for me.

758
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,460
We should think positively.

759
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,140
You are still here.

760
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,010
Aren't you?

761
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,010
That is true.

762
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,060
Think about it.

763
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,320
You hit the boss twice.

764
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,580
But you are still here.

765
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
What does it mean?

766
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,120
It means you did quite well.

767
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,450
That's right.

768
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,510
You can get off work now.

769
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,940
Go home and have a good rest.

770
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,440
Okay?

771
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,080
Okay.

772
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,730
Don't feel bad, Nan Xing.

773
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,330
Nan Xing, cheer up!

774
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,750
Thanks.

775
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,970
Cheer up!

776
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,060
Thanks.

777
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,020
What are you doing? You startled me.

778
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,679
Don't move.

What are you doing?

781

Looks like you can't do this on your own.

782
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,020
Do you have photos?

783
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,530
Why do you want them?

784
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,300
Ward off evil, of course.

785
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,020
I don't.

786
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,600
Do you want me to go back?

787
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,449
Yes.

788
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,840

789
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,810
stop asking.

Alright. I will send them to you tonight.

791
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,380
Wait a minute.

792

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,810
No.

That's good then.

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,490
It looks messy.

875
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,970
Done.

876
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,000
Nan Xing.

877
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,270
Nan Xing.

878
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,780
Nan... Nan...

879
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,250
Miss Jiao.

880
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,720
Nan Xing, I am sorry.

881
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,700
I am so sorry.

882
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,150
I have been too busy today.

883
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,000
I almost forgot about you.

884
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,790
Don't worry about it.

885
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,660
My gosh.

886
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,020
God, did you...

887
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,330
Did you do all this by yourself?

888
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,640
You're so amazing.

889
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,530
I am just physically strong.

890
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,500
That is all I am good at.

891
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,360
Don't say that.

892
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,640
It is amazing that

893
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,270
you can tidy this place up.

894
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,750
Let me put it this way.

895
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,150
If Boss doesn't want you,

896
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,480
I want you.

897
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,210
I almost forgot.

898
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,840
Someone is here for you.

899
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,060
Who?

900
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,960
A super handsome guy.

901
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,690
I think he is more handsome than Boss.

902
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,080
He said he's your neighbour.
