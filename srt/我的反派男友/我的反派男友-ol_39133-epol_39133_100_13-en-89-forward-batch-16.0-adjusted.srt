Why didn't you switch on the lights?

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,770
Are they faulty?

8
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,210
Don't.

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,770
Even the brightest light

10
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,729

Just tell me what is going on.

Don't be polite with me.

meticulous and considerate.

He's changed into a caring guy.

Wait.

107
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,210
Why did he

108
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,050
suddenly turn into a caring guy?

109
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Is he plotting something again?

110
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,330
Forget it.

111
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
I don't care what he is pulling.

112
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
Just leave me out of it.

113
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,090
I will enjoy my freedom for now.

114

The devil has turned over a new leaf?

118
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,320
That would be too boring.

119

No way.

120
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,430
I need to give him a romantic plot.

121
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,830
Why don't I just

122
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,780
give the female lead a boyfriend?

123
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,530

Are you alright?

140
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
I am fine.

141
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,360
I am tired after all that walking.

142
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,700
So I am just squatting down to rest.

143
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,530
Don't squat for too long.

144
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,720
Squatting for too long

145
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,380
will make your head spin
when you stand up later.

146

This boyfriend

147

still feels like Hero Lu.

148
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,210
Not cool enough.

149
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,240
Obviously, he is a caring guy too.

150
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,850
Very polite.

151
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,330
He's totally my ideal type.

152
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,960
But why isn't he

153
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,930
cool and also boring?

154
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,440
Why do I feel like

I suddenly don't know how to write?

156
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,520
Has my ideal type changed?

157
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
Or have I

158
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,240
lost my talent?

159
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,970
That is not it, Nan Xing.

160
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,120
You are just too exhausted right now.

161
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,170
It is getting too late.

162
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,320
You need to sleep.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,370
After you wake up,

164
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,640
the boyfriend will become cool.

165
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,250
He is just not cool.

166
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,080
I am doomed.

167
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
It's not that I can't write

168

when someone is watching me,

169
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,010
but I really can't.

170
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
I have lost my talent.

171

I knew

172
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,050
you would never give me true freedom.

173
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
It is too late now.

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
I really can't write it.

175

177
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,700
[Come and save me now.]

178
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,200
Sisi, what happened to you?

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
[Come here now.]

180
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
[Quick.]

181
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,160
Can you speak slowly?

182
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,000
[Hurry.]

183
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,150
[Only Wudi can pull off this tough vibe.]

184
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,010
[Look how scared they are.]

185
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,290
[Of course.]

186
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,160
[This is when a villain meets a villain.]

187
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,150
[You are in deep trouble now.]

188
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,160
Nice work.

189
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Nice work.

190
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,700
[What's going on?]

191
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,650
You must have worked very hard
to build those muscles.

192
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,120
Well?

193
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,020
Did you have a good breakfast?

194
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,320
How about lunch?

195
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,520
Is it time

196
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,930
to get off work?

197
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,930
You think I will return the money

198
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,690
if you come here with a good attitude?

199
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,890
This is outrageous.

200
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,520
You took so much money from her.

201
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,320
It's called scamming, you know?

202
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,900
That's enough.

203
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,480
You speak very loud.

204
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,600
I think you must be the manager.

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,240
Yes.

206
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,900
Hello. Nice to meet you.

207
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,930
Here.

208
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,640
Why don't we talk in private?

209
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,520
No, thanks.

210
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,690
We can just talk here.

211
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,280
Okay. No problem.

212
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Here is the thing.

213
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,900
There is a great saying.

214
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,440
Do not refuse to do good,
even if it is insignificant.

215
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,840
Do not engage in evil,
even if it is trivial.

216
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,160
Look.

217
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,030
Since you don't intend

218
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,890
to take this trainee in,

219
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,170
shouldn't you return her

220
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,090
administration

221
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,130
and course fees?

222
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Do you have proof?

223
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,250
Proof.

224
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,160
Justice will prevail.

225
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,290
You should

226
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,240
take the initiative to admit it.

227
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,180
Take the initiative to admit?

228
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,960
Nan Xing,

229
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,290
is he here

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,730
to reason with them?

231
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,090
Xiao Wudi,

232
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,130
why do you have to
pretend to be a gentleman?

233
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,120
What do you mean
I pretend to be a gentleman?

234
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,930
I don't.

235
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,010
Although

236
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,090
they are in the wrong first,

237
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,170
I believe

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,320
as long as we persevere

239
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,730
in convincing them by reasoning,

240
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,050
justice will prevail.

241
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
If I wanted to convince them by reasoning,

242
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,410
I wouldn't have asked you for help.

243
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,610
I have made up my mind.

244
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,640
From now on,

245
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,370
I will only convince people by reasoning.

246
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,320
Alright.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
You look like a polite person.

248
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,770
Moreover,

249
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,050
he hit my employee.

250
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,850
I haven't made him pay for that.

251
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,810
I won't return the money today.

252
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,610
Please leave.

253
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,080
Leave.

254
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,690
I am sorry.

255
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,610
I can't leave.

256
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,560
I haven't

257
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,090
made my reasoning clear.

258
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,440
How can I leave?

259
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,800
What an arrogant young lad.

260
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,560
You want to convince people by reasoning?

261
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,090
Then, you must have the ability

262
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,970
to do so.

263
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,650
Xiao Wudi,

264
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,970
if you have an opinion,

265
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,720
tell me when we get home.

266
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Stop fooling around.

267
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,450
Nan Xing.

268
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
It is dangerous here.

269
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,760
Step back.

270
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,320
May I know how do you want me to start?

271
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,650
What does this mean?

272
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,850
Nothing.

273
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,320
We just want to get close to you.

274
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,520
Xiao Wudi.

275
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,810
Miss,

276
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,520
don't talk nonsense.

277
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,000
I am recording this.

278
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Whoever makes the first move
will be at fault.

279
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,970
We can't accuse a good person.

280
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,810
Forget it.

281
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,800
I don't want the money back.

282
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,290
I don't want it.

283
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,090
Nan Xing, let's not get anyone hurt.

284
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,480
Nan Xing, I don't want the money anymore.

285
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,890
Let's not get anyone hurt. Really.

286
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,800
You don't want anyone to get hurt?

287
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,570
But you have

288
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,040
impacted my business, you know?

289
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,570
Whoever makes the first move
will be at fault.

290
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,610
You said that, right?

291
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,450
Yes.

292
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,010
Nan Xing,

293
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
take out your phone.

294
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
You start recording too.

295
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,640
Don't do this, Xiao Wudi.

296
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Do as I say.

297
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,290
Xiao Wudi,

298
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,970
forget it. Let's leave.

299
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,770
I don't want the money anymore.

300
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:08,960
Xiao Wudi.

301
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,240
Xiao Wudi.

302
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,410
Are you alright?

303
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,000
What are you doing?

304
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,850
I didn't ask you to take action.

305
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,850
Give me the phone.

306
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,050
Did you record it?

307
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,890
Yes.

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,930
Not cool enough.

309
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,530
But it is still acceptable.

310
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,680
You...

311
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,130
[Can you see it?]

312
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,609
[Proof.]

313
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,319
Get that.

314
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,200
Go.

315
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,240
If I give this to the police,

316
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,530
they will surely investigate it.

317
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,840
There will be inspection charges,
medical expenses

318
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,880
and emotional distress charges.

319
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,890
I am sure you will have to pay all this.

320
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,610
How long will the whole process take

321
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,120
and how much time will be wasted?

322
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,640
You should do the math.

323
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,080
Now tell me.

324
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,710
Are you going to return the money?

325
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,120
Yes.

326
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,330
Yes.

327
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,240
I will.

328
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,030
Your phone.

329
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
For transferring the money.

330
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
Here you go. My phone.

331
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,600
After that,

332
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,330
we went to the police station

333
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,010
to report

334
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,500
that evil fitness centre.

335
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,840
Xiong Sisi's money

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,720
was fully refunded too.

337
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,530
Great.

338
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,000
Who is the hero of the day?

339
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,930
Xiao Wudi.

340
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,010
Who is Xiao Wudi?

341
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
The hero!

342
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,320
-Hero!
-Hero!

343
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,050
♫ Take a few turns ♫

344
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,390
♫ And the sunshine brings a new day ♫

345
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,210
-Hero!
-Hero!

346
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,060
♫ Running with you ♫

347
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,210
-Hero!
-Hero!

348
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,400
♫ You are the one that God gave me ♫

349
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800

That was so cool.

No.

You are still the same old you.

Yes, you are still the same old you.

You intimidate, coerce,

You are still that devil.

So all my efforts in these days
have been in vain?

Yes.

406
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,450
You've been very strange
the last two days.

407
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:33,960

408
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
so many baffling things.

409
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,610
You were hesitant when you talked.

410
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,330
And during the fight just now,

411
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,610
you pretended to be
a gentleman for a while.

412
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,960
It's really not like you.

413

You don't have to do that.

414
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,560
I pretended because of you.

415
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,160
Because of me?

416
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,200
Would Young Master Xiao

417
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,730
do anything because of me?

418
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,850
I wanted you to like me.

419
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,840
Didn't you tell me

420
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,890
you're afraid of me?

421
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,570
You even said

422
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,850
everything must be real

423
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,640
in order to be written into the novel.

424
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,570
So I've spent

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,960
the last two days shaping myself

426
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,400
to give you some materials to write about.

427
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,770
Is it not necessary now?

428

That's not what I meant.

429

That's exactly what you meant.

430

defaming me.

432

Actually, after our company

523
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,880
nurtures a new writer,

524
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,690
we will not only deal with
intellectual property licensing

525
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,490
of physical books,

526
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,280
but movies, animations

527
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,410
and games

528
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,400
are also

529
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,840
important revenue sources
of our company.

530
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,010
Hence, I hope this time

531
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,270
you can handle matters

532
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,010
regarding your boss's
intellectual property licensing.

533
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,810
I think

534
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,240
based on your knowledge of him,

535
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,970
you should be able to do the job.

536
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,940
But I have never

537
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,240
dealt with that before.

538
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,170
I don't even know

539
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,240
where to start.

540
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,210
It's alright.

541
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,600
Just start with

542
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,840
audio books.

543
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,410
After I return from my business trip,

544
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,290
I will test you.

545
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,130
Study well.

546
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,880
I will.

547
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,200
One more thing.

548
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
How is the New Star Program

549
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,000
going for you?

550
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,410
Have you finished writing your novel?

551
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,490
No.

552
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,770
I am still writing.
I haven't submitted it.

553
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,730
The deadline is coming soon.

554
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,770
You'd better hurry.

555
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,760
When I return two days later,

556
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,650
we will need to make a decision.

557
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
Also, you have to balance your tasks

558
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,330
and novel writing very well.

559
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,080
I got it.

560
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,850
Don't forget to remind your boss

561
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,980
about his schedule.

562
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,180
He said he would not be
coming to the office for two days.

563
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,000
He seems to be depressed.

564
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,360
I will get back to work, Miss Ye.

565
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:23,920
Okay.

566
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,200
Is Mr. Lu trying to pursue you?

567
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,360
Zichen?

568
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,000
You believe the online gossips too?

569
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Didn't you

570
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,190
go bungee jumping recently?

571
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,160
He has a fear of heights.

572
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,460
Despite not being good at it,

573
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,600
he still plucked up the courage
to accompany you.

574
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,860
Don't tell me
he isn't interested in you.

575
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,120
[Hello?]

576
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,100
Hello? Zichen?

577
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,780
Where are you?

578
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,940
No worries. I can talk.

579
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,170
What is it?

580
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,860
Nothing serious.

581
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,120
I just want to remind you

582
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,390
to read the new submissions
of new writers.

583
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:32,810
Okay.

584
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,760
What is that sound?

585
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,030
You are not at home?

586
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,700
It is nothing.

587
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,300
I came out to get some fresh air.

588
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,950
That's good.

589
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,670
You should

590
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,480
get out of the house more often.

591
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,990
By the way,

592
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,960
how was yesterday's rock climbing?

593
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,730
[I think that doctor]

594
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,620
is interested in you.

595
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,600
You seem to be very nosy these days,

596
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,060
Mr. Lu.

597
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,130
We have been friends
for more than a decade.

598
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,600
It is normal to care.

599
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,700
Besides, I think

600
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,170
he is not bad.

601
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,930
I heard he has a girlfriend.

602
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,760
That's too bad.

603
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,240
[Zichen.]

604
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,840
I...

605
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,460
What?

606
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,930
Tell me.

607
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,920
Forget it.

608
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,090
It is hard to talk over the phone.

609
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,260
You carry on with what you are doing.

610
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,270
[After I return from my business trip,]

611
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,130
[we will talk.]

612
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,740
Okay.

613
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,090
I will hang up now.

614
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,980
[Don't forget to read the manuscripts.]

615
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,560
Okay.

616
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,240
Bye.

617
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,380
Bye.

618
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,730
He already has a girlfriend. Great.

619
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,250
Did she sense it?

620
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:59,970
[Lu Zichen]

621
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,950
[I am reading the manuscripts.]

622
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,950
[Are you asleep?]

623
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,890
[What did you want to say]

624
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,550
[when you called me earlier?]

625
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,510
Why do you need so much money?

626
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,580
I want to start my own business.

627
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,210
I want to build
our own audience platform

628
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:30,610
so that

629
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,940
more writers like me

630
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,120
are given a chance.

631
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,480
You just created one bestseller.

632
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,870
Now you are thinking of
saving the entire industry?

633
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,370
Isn't that too naive?

634
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,340
Maybe I am naive.

635
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,390
But I truly believe that

636
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,700
people who like writing

637
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,580
like me

638
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,100
need an opportunity

639
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,750
to focus on their creations.

640
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,810
The goal of starting a business

641
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,480
is profit.

642
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,080
It doesn't require

643
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,390
naive idealists.

644
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,950
Besides,

645
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,920
do you know

646
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,490
the risk of that business

647
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,860
you plan to venture in?

648
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,170
If the risk is high
and the profit is low,

649
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,230
I would rather buy financial products

650
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,610
from bankers.

651
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,680
In any case,

652
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,490
if the company was established,

653
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,420
who would run it?

654
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,270
Me.

655
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,820
Do kids nowadays

656
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,420
say whatever they want

657
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,810
without having to take responsibility?

658
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,440
Uncle Lu,

659
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,630
the success of Zichen's novel

660
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,830
is not a coincidence.

661
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,860
As long as he keeps writing,

662
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,500
our platform

663
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,430
will have a huge base of readers.

664
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,530
We will then be able to

665
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,750
hire more great writers.

666
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,010
With Zichen's talent,

667
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,400
I trust that we will get

668
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,320
more outstanding writers

669
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,120
and create more excellent works

670
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,080
in the future.

671
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,850
Besides, this industry

672
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,700
is set for an explosive growth.

673
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,460
The company of two of us

674
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,220
will become the main force.

675
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,420
Is that how

676
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,980
she usually pleases you?

677
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,070
And you believe her?

678
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,370
And you fall for her?

679
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,350
And then you team up

680
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,280
to rip me off?

681
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,410
Uncle Lu, we...

682
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,840
I am talking to my son.

683
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,020
We are not

684
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,580
in that kind of relationship.

685
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,170
So you don't like her?

686
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,270
You can't answer that?

687
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,050
Ye Qing and I are business partners.

688
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,880
I won't fall for her.

689
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,300
[Did you mean]

690
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,430
[what you said back then?]

691
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:20,770
Here.

692
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,410
Cheers, Wudi.

693
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,469
Enjoy the food and drinks.

694
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,730
Sure. Thanks, Wudi.

695
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,020
Wudi, I envy you so much.

696
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,510
If I could be like you,

697
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,790
I would be able to protect Sisi

698
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,590
and help her solve her problems.

699
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,449
It's not a big deal.

700
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,540
Next time,

701
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,350
I can teach you a trick or two.

702
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,900
For real?

703
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,489
Wait.

704
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,909
You mean you will take me
as your disciple?

705
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,639
Master.

706
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,409
Please accept my gratitude.

707
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,630
Get up.

708
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,230
I won't take any disciples.

709
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,300
But since you have someone

710
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,020
you want to protect,

711
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,780
I will teach you a trick or two.

712
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,440
It might come in handy one day.

713
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,560
Thank you, Master.

714
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,230
Cheers.

715
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,400
A toast to Wudi.

716
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:05,590
Wudi, you are my hero.

717
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,810
Cheers, Wudi.

718
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:07,690
Come on, enjoy the food and drinks.

719
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,820
Don't go over there.

720
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,050
Wudi,

721
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,560
since you are that good,

722
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,730
why don't we have
an arm wrestling match?

723
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,320
Okay.

724
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,810
You represent the track and field team.

725
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,810
Don't embarrass us.

726
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,860
-Come on.
-Come on.

727
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,790
Why are you laughing?

728
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,190
Because I find you a fool.

729
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,560
What's wrong with me?

730
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,110
Go!

731
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,180
What do you think about Hao?

732
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,100
Hao is a very nice guy.

733
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,820
He also has a great personality.

734
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,740
Every time we go out,

735
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,250
he helps us to carry things.

736
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,810
He even lights the mood up.

737
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,030
Whenever we plan to have a meal

738
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,950
or go for drinks,

739
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,420
he will make the reservation for us.

740
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,600
That is so nice of him.

741
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,990
Don't always include us.

742
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,670
When you are not around,

743
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,310
he isn't that attentive.

744
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,910
Really?

745
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,800
You can't tell it?

746
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,820
Look at this incident.

747
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,480
Because of you,

748
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
he got into a fight and hurt his hand.

749
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,360
Now he is drinking with Xiao Wudi

750
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,890
to thank him on your behalf.

751
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,490
Three, two, go!

752
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,540
Anyway,

753
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,270
he's not bad.

754
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,390
Not bad?

755
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,850
He even took you to
meet his elder brother.

756
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,100
You'd better give it a good thought.

757
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,120
Go! Go! Go!

758
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,520
Loser has to drink!

759
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,330
Who is next?

760
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,420
-Nan Xing.
-Nan Xing.

761
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,640
It is Nan Xing's turn.

762
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,820
-Nan Xing.
-Nan Xing.

763
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,260
-Nan Xing.

-Nan Xing.
-Nan Xing.

765
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,700
Are you sure?

766
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,560
I am good at this too, you know?

767
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,940
Master, you are doomed.

768
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,700
Nan Xing, go for it.

769
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,960
Nan Xing, go for it.

770
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,530
Come on. Three, two, one.

771
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,080
Go!

772
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,050
Go! Go! Go!

773
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,690
-Nan Xing, go for it!
-Nan Xing, go for it!

774
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,580
Go! Go! Go!

775
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,290
Go!

776
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,970
Hang in there, Master.

777
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,540
Go! Go! Go!

778
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,550
Go for it!

779
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,270
Xiao Wudi,

780
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,030
are you

781
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,590
using a lot of strength?

782
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,180
I can't do this.

783
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,010
Use your strength, Master.

784
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,220
What are you two doing?

785
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,230
What are you doing?

786
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,290
-I will drink.
-Drink wine.

787
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,680
Master, how can you lose?

788
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,140
Master.

789
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,320
-Chug!
-Chug!

790
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,720
I will drink too.

791
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,670
Sisi,

792
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,230
I've told you so much,

793
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,030
are you listening or not?

794
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,140
I am not listening.

795
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,760
Whatever you say.

796
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,440
[Men and Women]

797
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,450
Stop drinking.

798
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,130
I want to drink.

799
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,020
I must drink.

800
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,250
Since you are so cool

801
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,680
and kind,

802
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,070
I need to have one more drink.

803
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:10,820
In that case,

804
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,060
okay.

805
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,870
Since you are

806
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,330
so good at sweet-talking,

807
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,250
you can have one more drink.
