What kind of person is he?

48

Are you okay?

49
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,220
She's going.

A called death.

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
This way.

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
All of you, leave.

56
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,960
Get up.

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,160
Go.

58
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Are you okay?

59
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,760
Hurry and leave.

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,160
I'll help you get up.

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,360
Go.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
Slowly.

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Be careful.

64
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,560
I'll help you get up.

65
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
I really love eating.

66
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Okay.

67
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
How is it?

68
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Not bad.

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,760
Mr. Lu,

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,960
the place for tomorrow is over there.

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
Director Lu.

72
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
Are those two people?

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
Ziqian, why are you here?

74
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Director Lu,

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,360
the previous two people

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
are all here.

77
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm here to help you.

78
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Director Lu,

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,160
I saw you on TV before.

80
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,760
This time, I finally see you.

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
Song Jiaming.

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Hello.

83
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,760
Which company?

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,360
My boyfriend.

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,760
Hello, I'm Song Jiaming.

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,760
Director Lu, do you want to eat together?

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,960
I booked a table.

88
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,560
You guys eat.

89
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,760
Okay, take your time.

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Director Lu seems a little shy.

91
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
She's shy?

92
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Then you didn't see her

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
with her hair up?

94
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,360
So fierce.

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
Really?

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Mr. Lu,

97
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
are you Yuwei?

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,960
Okay.

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,760
Then I'll take the table.

100
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,760
Yi Qing,

101
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,560
happy birthday.

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
How did you know

103
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,560
that I'm celebrating my birthday today?

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Let me put it on for you.

105
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
Okay.

106
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
Sorry, I'm going to leave now.

107
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,560
It looks good.

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,160
It looks good.

109
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,960
Thank you.

110
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,960
How is it?

111
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
Is it good?

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,560
It's good.

113
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
It's good?

114
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
It's good.

115
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,360
How is it?

116
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,960
Is it good?

117
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Do you need some hot tea?

118
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,960
No, I'm much better now.

119
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
It's really dangerous when you think about it.

120
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,360
Your front foot just walked from me,

121
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,160
and you met them at the back.

122
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
Yes.

123
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,560
You just said that

124
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,960
the person who saved you

125
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
is tall,

126
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
and is 180 cm tall.

127
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,560
Yes.

128
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,160
Can you describe

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,960
the incident?

130
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,760
At that time,

131
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I was very scared.

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
My hands and feet were soft,

133
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,160
and I was squatting on the ground.

134
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
I couldn't even stand up.

135
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I thought that I was going to be dead by then.

136
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
But he suddenly appeared

137
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,760
and saved me.

138
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,960
He was very good at fighting.

139
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,760
He defeated those people in one hit.

140
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,160
You said that he was very good at fighting?

141
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes.

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,160
Okay, take a look.

143
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,360
Is there any problem with this report?

144
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
If there is nothing to add,

145
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
please sign here.

146
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,560
Okay.

147
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll ask you one more question.

148
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
You really didn't see clearly

149
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,960
what that person looked like?

150
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
No.

151
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Don't worry.

152
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Our police

153
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,160
will definitely find him for you.

154
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,560
Find him for me?

155
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
No need.

156
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Maybe he just wants to

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
do good things without leaving a name.

158
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
Then I have to find him.

159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Such a noble character,

160
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,560
it's more worth it for us

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,360
to study hard.

162
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Please don't be found.

163
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,760
I've signed it.

164
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
Okay.

165
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Okay.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,360
I'll arrange a police officer to send you back.

167
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
It's okay.

168
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I can go back by myself.

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
You don't have to be so polite.

170
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,560
It's really okay.

171
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
My house is very close to here.

172
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Thank you.

173
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,760
You've worked hard.

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Be careful on the road.

175
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,360
Okay.

176
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Why did he suddenly appear again?

177
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,160
Where did he go now?

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
Where's my key?

179
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,960
Why are you so slow?

180
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Why are you back?

181
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,560
You took my key again.

182
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,160
Or I'll wait for you at your door.

183
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,760
He's here.

184
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,760
Speaking of this.

185
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,160
Didn't I tell you,

186
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
if you really ask me to attend the opening party.

187
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,360
My boss won't not like it.

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
Abby's mom

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,360
made it up.

190
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
What headquarters?

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,960
No one now.

192
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm warning you.

193
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
If you call me again,

194
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
you have to choose a suitable time.

195
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Can you afford to lose these things?

196
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
You went to rob the money?

197
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
You really only know to be a spy?

198
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
You didn't rob?

199
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Although I don't care about the police here,

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
but in this situation,

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I have no choice but to

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I won't attract their attention.

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
After all, I don't have a legal identity here.

204
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
That's good.

205
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
You scared me.

206
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,960
You want to ask why I suddenly appeared to save you?

207
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Let me explain to you first.

208
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm not saving you.

209
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I'm just taking care of my hostage.

210
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Moreover,

211
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm the only one who eats the black food.

212
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
No one can eat me.

213
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,960
So I called you here again.

214
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I remember I told you before.

215
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Before I was called by you,

216
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
I heard your voice.

217
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Help me.

218
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Don't be a dog.

219
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Can you help me?

220
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Help me.

221
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I heard it again this time.

222
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
But what's the connection between these two times?

223
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Although you said it has nothing to do with it,

224
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
but the circumstances of these two times are similar.

225
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,960
It's all when you need to be saved by a hero.

226
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
A hero?

227
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Otherwise,

228
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,960
you can't take anything off yourself.

229
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
He really was sent by the fairy to save me.

230
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Then I can do whatever I want in the future.

231
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
As long as I can summon him at the critical moment.

232
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I warn you.

233
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
You are not allowed to give me any trouble in the future.

234
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
What trouble can I encounter?

235
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
It's normal for you to encounter any trouble in your mind.

236
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Anyway, I have a word first.

237
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
If you summon me again next time,

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
I won't help you no matter what happens.

239
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
And if you keep encountering trouble,

240
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I can only solve your trouble first.

241
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Sleep.

242
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Wait.

243
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
What's wrong?

244
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Say something.

245
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I...

246
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I will regret it.

247
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Come with me.

248
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Morning.

249
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Come in.

250
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Whose house is this?

251
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
It's mine.

252
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I have made a deal with you first.

253
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I will let you sponsor this place.

254
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I won't take your rent.

255
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
But you have to promise me one condition.

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,960
What condition?

257
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
You can't just come to me.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Especially after my mom comes back.

259
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Otherwise, she will see you.

260
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
How can I explain to her?

261
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
You mean

262
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
I should care about your feelings

263
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
and not give you any trouble?

264
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Yes.

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
But why should I care about your feelings?

266
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
You are my mom.

267
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
But why should I care about your feelings?

268
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
You...

269
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Pay attention to your identity.

270
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
You are a hostage now.

271
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
I am the one who is a scapegoat.

272
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
It's okay if you don't want me to see your mom.

273
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
But you have to give me some benefits.

274
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,960
You are a bad person.

275
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Otherwise, I can move back to live with you.

276
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Anyway, that bed...

277
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Wait.

278
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Well, tell me.

279
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
What condition?

280
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I need a smart phone.

281
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
You know smart phone?

282
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Smart phone.

283
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
It's like a personal computer.

284
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
It has independent operating space

285
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
and independent operating program.

286
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
It can be used by users to install software,

287
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
games, navigation, etc.

288
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
and other third-party service providers.

289
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
And it can be used to move the network

290
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
and make the wireless network access

291
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
to the mobile phone.

292
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Wow.

293
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Don't be surprised.

294
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I can see it clearly.

295
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
I have a spare smart phone.

296
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
During this period,

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I need to study the way to go back to the ancient times.

298
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
There is more information on the Internet than in the library.

299
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
And it's updated fast.

300
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
So don't bother me during this period.

301
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
In theory,

302
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
you should be responsible for my meals

303
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
and the rest of my life.

304
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
But you look clumsy.

305
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Just order three meals for me on time

306
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
and send them here.

307
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
I don't have so much money.

308
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Tell me after you finish it.

309
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
So much?

310
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Tonight,

311
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
put my things in the living room.

312
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Don't bother me to sleep.

313
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Then you...

314
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
I want to sleep.

315
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Do you want to sleep together?

316
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
No.

317
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Wait a minute.

318
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I have to go to the bathroom.

319
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I'll be back soon.

320
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
I'll see you later.

321
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
See you later.

322
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
See you later.

323
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
See you later.

324
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Why are you afraid of fire?

325
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
I had a fire in my middle school.

326
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,960
I still get a fever after so many years.

327
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Modern doctors can't cure it.

328
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
The doctor said

329
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
the cure needs to be done by the person who can cure me.

330
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
But the person who can cure me

331
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
is gone.

332
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
But

333
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
I'll be fine as long as I don't see the fire.

334
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
For example,

335
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
don't blow the candles on your birthday.

336
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Don't watch fireworks.

337
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Don't use the lighter at home.

338
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
These things.

339
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
As long as I can do these things, I'll be fine.

340
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
You're so weak.

341
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
I was wondering if you would be recorded.

342
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
When did you say that?

343
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
I always say that.

344
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm the best, right?

345
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
If I run again,

346
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
we'll celebrate, right?

347
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I think the show will be over the day after tomorrow.

348
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
It can be over the day after tomorrow.

349
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
I'll go back first.

350
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
No, no.

351
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
I mean, you should get back to work.

352
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
I'll be fine at home.

353
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,960
If your dad was here,

354
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
we could have a big meal together.

355
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,960
We can have a big meal together, right?

356
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Yes, I'll go back.

357
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's have a real Michelin meal.

358
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Okay?

359
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
As long as we don't eat at home,

360
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
there's nothing to eat outside.

361
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
You're the best cook I've ever made.

362
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
You're talking too much.

363
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
What's wrong with this guy?

364
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Dad, I found a job.

365
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
And it's not an ordinary job.

366
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
I'm going to be an assistant to my idol.

367
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
After I come back tonight,

368
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
I'll share with you

369
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
what's going on at work today.

370
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Mao Xiaojun, cheer me up.

371
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Okay, I'm leaving.

372
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Bye.

373
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I almost forgot about Xiao Wudi.

374
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I'll go see him.

375
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Xiao Wudi.

376
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Xiao Wudi, are you up?

377
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Did he run out?

378
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh my god, help!

379
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Did I tell you

380
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
not to disturb me?

381
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
You're hurting me.

382
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I...

383
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Get out!

384
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
But I...

385
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Well...

386
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Well...

387
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Why haven't I had breakfast?

388
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
I just wanted to tell you about your takeout.

389
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I ordered it for you.

390
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
The deliveryman will call you.

391
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Do you know how to use your phone?

392
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
He didn't call me.

393
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
You know how to use it so fast?

394
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Okay, you can call me on the phone.

395
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
I'm leaving.

396
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
See you.

397
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
I can speak English.

398
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Is it going to be a rule of thumb?

399
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Hello, I'm here to report today.

400
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
My name is Nanxing.

401
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Which department?

402
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
The president's office.

403
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
The president's office?

404
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
You can sit there.

405
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
No one is answering the phone.

406
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
I'll go in and look for it.

407
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Okay, thank you.

408
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I'll go in and look for it.

409
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I'll go in and look for it.

410
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Okay, thank you.

411
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
I'll go in and look for it.

412
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I'll go in and look for it.

413
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
I'll go in and look for it.

414
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Okay.

415
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Let me down.

416
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Okay.

417
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Let me do it.

418
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Okay.

419
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Thank you.

420
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
How about you help me carry this?

421
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Okay, thank you.

422
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Nanxing...

423
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Nanxing, right?

424
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
This is our president's office.

425
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Please allow me to introduce myself.

426
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I'm the president's person.

427
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
My name is Hu Jiaojiao.

428
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
You can call me Jiaojiao.

429
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
This is Xiaochu, and this is Yu Fan.

430
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Nice to meet you, Jiaojiao.

431
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Nice to meet you, Yu Fan.

432
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Nice to meet you, Xiaochu.

433
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Nice to meet you, Xiaoshu.

434
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Nice to meet you, Yifan.

435
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Nice to meet you, Yifan.

436
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
This is my mom.

437
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Hello, sister.

438
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,760
Hello, Brother Yufan

439
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,680
Hello, Sister Xiao Chu

440
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,960
My name is Yufan

441
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,800
And don't call me sister

442
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,040
I'm Xiao Chu

443
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
Just call me Xiao Chu

444
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,720
Well, I'll probably introduce you to work

445
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,040
The scope of our president's work is very broad

446
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,280
For example, planning, publishing, signing

447
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,360
Connecting media platforms

448
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,640
We will design these

449
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,240
But our service object

450
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,320
There is only one

451
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,240
Is our president

452
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,360
Lu Zichen

453
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,560
Teacher Lu

454
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,320
That one

455
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,040
You will get familiar with it sooner or later

456
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,240
I'll take you to other departments to visit

457
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,200
Come with me

458
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,800
There are still a lot of departments in our company

459
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
This is our publishing department

460
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,480
Wait a minute

461
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,600
Brother Haitao

462
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,360
That one to introduce to you

463
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,560
This is our boss of the publishing department

464
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,320
Brother Haitao

465
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,040
This is our new president's office

466
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,760
President assistant, Nanxing

467
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,920
Brother Haitao

468
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,040
Not bad

469
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,160
Come on

470
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Come on

471
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,320
That one, let's go

472
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,400
This is our publicity department

473
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,160
Mainly responsible for the new book

474
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
Propagation on all platforms

475
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,240
What kind of

476
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,760
Sister Shan

477
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,560
That one to introduce

478
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,520
This is the boss of the publicity department, Sister Shan Shan

479
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,120
Hello, this is our president's new assistant, Nanxing

480
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Sister Shan

481
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,320
Good feeling

482
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
Hello hello hello

483
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,160
I am Xiao Lin

484
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,640
Thank you for the morning

485
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,000
Just call me Xiaotong in the future

486
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,160
Sister Qiao, she is really strong

487
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,120
Uncle Ban in the morning

488
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,280
Can you lend us a use

489
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,520
Do a backup situation

490
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,800
Translate it to see if it can be paid back

491
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,360
President Ye

492
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,520
Nanxing

493
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,440
This is our Ye Qing, CEO of Ye早

494
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,480
This is

495
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
I'll be fine after I know it

496
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,640
The editor is not responsible

497
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,400
Let me try

498
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,120
OK, OK

499
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll take it right away

500
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,120
Nanxing, right

501
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,640
Come with me

502
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Come on

503
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,440
I can't eat you

504
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:13,840
you

505
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,200
Walk, go

506
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
You graduated from this major

507
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
and never had any work experience, right?

508
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
But you are Lu Zichen's reader

509
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I've seen your resume

510
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
and your interview records

511
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
You don't really meet

512
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
my requirements for the assistant

513
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
But I still let them

514
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
recruit you, do you know why?

515
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Because you said

516
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
not to give up

517
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
I'm an athlete

518
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
I'm an athlete

519
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm taught by athletes

520
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
not to give up

521
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
not to give up

522
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
If you can do this

523
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
I believe you can take this position

524
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Can you?

525
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
You can talk, right?

526
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Yes

527
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I'm just a little bit too nervous

528
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
You're so nervous

529
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
You're so nervous

530
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
How can you face Lu Zichen?

531
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
How can you be his assistant?

532
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
The assistant is the best job

533
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
If you work hard, you'll make a big progress

534
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I was his assistant

535
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I know

536
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
I saw it online

537
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
All the gossip is true

538
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
except that I'm his friend

539
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
He also sees this?

540
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Of course

541
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
He is the biggest asset of my company

542
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
He is also one of my work content

543
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
I've been his assistant for ten years

544
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Today I want to give you this burden

545
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Can you?

546
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
I think so

547
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
The president's assistant is the company's

548
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
highest-release position

549
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Even if it fails, it's not a big deal

550
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
And you've been in the company

551
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Even if you succeed

552
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
The result doesn't matter, enjoy the process

553
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Go to work

554
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
It's the same this year

555
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I'll take you to ice skating

556
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Happy birthday

557
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Go

558
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Miss, I'll go first

559
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
I'll be right there

560
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Miss

561
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Is that the flower for me?

562
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
That flower

563
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
It should be your

564
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
last assistant's

565
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
It's quite fresh

566
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
The president's assistant is the company's

567
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
highest-release position

568
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Miss

569
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Our boss is fierce

570
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Mr. Ye told you?

571
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Absolutely

572
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm not sure

573
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Don't worry

574
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,520
The boss is very

575
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,160
unruly

576
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
He never scolds people

577
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Yes

578
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I saw him at the signing meeting

579
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
I felt the same way

580
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
He usually doesn't like anyone

581
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
He just exposes him

582
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
He won't scold you

583
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
You don't have to be too nervous

584
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
The boss

585
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
He doesn't usually appear in the company

586
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
He usually writes at home

587
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Sometimes he comes to the company

588
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Or has a meeting

589
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
That is to say

590
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
He doesn't appear in the company

591
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
But he may appear at any time

592
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
What do I need to prepare?

593
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
No need to prepare

594
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
You should be prepared mentally

595
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Everyone is here

596
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I'll have a meeting first

597
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
You go ahead

598
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I'll go first

599
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Thanks

600
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Lin Fan

601
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I forgot to bring a cup today

602
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Do we have any extra cups

603
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I can borrow

604
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
You won't drink a sip from morning to now

605
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
You haven't drunk water for a day

606
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
You won't be thirsty

607
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Come with me

608
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
What's going on?

609
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
This is the company's spare water cup

610
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
You drink water with it

611
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
After drinking, wash it and put it in

612
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Ok, thank you

613
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
You said

614
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
The wedding of Wan Shan Company

615
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Is it too difficult?

616
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Did you forget those ex-employees?

617
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Just realized that the company was fired

618
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
It's embarrassing

619
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I think

620
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
What Yufan said makes sense

621
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Let's go

622
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Go

623
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Everyone is off work

624
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
I'm leaving, bye

625
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Miss

626
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
What do I need to do tomorrow?

627
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Tomorrow

628
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
That little Chu

629
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Do you have any printing tomorrow?

630
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Ok

631
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
I'm off work

632
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Bye

633
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Bye

634
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Bye

635
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Yufan, bye

636
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Nanxing

637
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
What's wrong?

638
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
You are not happy about your first day?

639
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
No

640
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Don't think too much, Nanxing

641
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
You should celebrate your first day as a newbie

642
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Yes, don't be unhappy

643
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
There is a lot of books to be done tomorrow

644
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Can you help us?

645
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Of course, no problem

646
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Really? Thank you

647
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
We are leaving, Nanxing

648
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Don't be unhappy

649
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Bye

650
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Celebrate

651
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Ok

652
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Who are you looking for?

653
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
An Ning is not at home

654
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
Xiong Sisi

655
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Hello, Sisi

656
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Hello, Xin

657
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
How do you feel about your first day?

658
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
I feel like an idol

659
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
I didn't see her

660
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
The boss is not here today

661
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
I heard that he is not here every day

662
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm so nervous today

663
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
I don't know what to do

664
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Right

665
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm going to work today

666
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Do you want to come out and celebrate with me?

667
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Tonight?

668
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
It's all Xiao Hang's fault

669
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
He insisted on having a special training tonight

670
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I'm sorry, Xin

671
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
I can't be with you at the first time

672
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
How about tomorrow?

673
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Ok, it's ok

674
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
You can go

675
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
It's settled

676
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
I'm so happy for you

677
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Ok, I know

678
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Bye

679
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Water

680
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Sisi can't do it

681
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Who else can I find?

682
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Xiao Wu Di

683
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
No

684
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
No

685
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
I'll go to celebrate by myself

686
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Huo Jin also thinks that time travel is impossible

687
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
How should I go back?

688
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Do I have to be here all the time

689
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
As the bodyguard of that idiot?

690
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Why is the dinner not here yet?

691
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Did this idiot forget to order for me?

692
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I want a fried wonton

693
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
I want a fried wonton

694
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Fried wonton

695
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
A sour soup fish

696
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:42,120
A fried sausage with a

697
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Thank you

698
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
This is our signature dish

699
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
It's very delicious

700
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Enjoy

701
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Thank you

702
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
It's delicious

703
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Try some more

704
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Ok

705
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
I've been an assistant for a day

706
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I've realized my life dream

707
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
I've done a good job

708
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Don't think too much

709
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
From tomorrow

710
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
I'll be more active

711
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
You order for yourself

712
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,160
I'm still nervous tomorrow

713
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
I'm still nervous tomorrow

714
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,160
You have a mouth and a mouth

715
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Help

716
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
You have a mouth too

717
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
When can someone wipe my mouth?

718
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
What does it feel like?

719
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Help

720
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
When can someone wipe my mouth?

721
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
What does it feel like?

722
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
I called you again

723
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,160
When can someone help me wipe my mouth?

724
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
What does it feel like?

725
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
You have a mouth again

726
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
This is a big trouble

727
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
No one helped you wipe your mouth

728
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
You can be quiet

729
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I told you

730
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Next time, no matter what reason you call me

731
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
I won't help you

732
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Not to mention wiping your mouth

733
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Wipe my mouth

734
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Just wipe my mouth

735
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
When can someone wipe my mouth?

736
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
What does it feel like?

737
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Little father

738
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Look, what's wrong with him?

739
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Are you okay?

740
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
What's wrong?

741
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Get out of my way

742
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Don't look

743
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Don't look

744
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Is this okay?

745
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
You

746
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Little father, you

747
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Are you crazy?

748
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
You ungrateful

749
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
You passed it on for no reason

750
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
You just grabbed my mouth and wiped it

751
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
I have to apologize to him

752
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Can you see it?

753
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
The first time I called

754
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
He was stuck on the road

755
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
The second time he was in danger

756
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
The third time he was in danger

757
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
The third time he was just eating

758
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
But if I don't help him

759
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
He will be like a well-nourished boat

760
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
That makes my head hurt

761
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
This is all so strange

762
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
There must be some rules

763
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,160
I didn't notice

764
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Maybe

765
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
He didn't tell me the truth

766
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
What a bad guy

767
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
He got me such a big devil

768

Not even have a shoulder to lean on
