1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
Youle Beauty is in your palm.

2
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,480
Warm hands and warm heart.

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,800
Youle Beauty invites you to watch the wonderful moment.

4
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,960
Right.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,880
You've been acting weird these days.

6
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm pretending because of you.

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
Because of me?

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,640
You, Mr. Xiao,

9
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,880
will do things for me?

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,320
I'm doing this to make you like me.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
You and your team members

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,240
are having fun.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,480
You two are eating, drinking and chatting.

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,480
You two are so carefree.

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,160
I think they are

16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,840
just like Si Si.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,920
They don't talk.

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,360
No.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,880
They are

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,960
good brothers.

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,760
We train together.

22
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,840
We sweat together.

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,360
So I think they are

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
just like Si Si.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
They don't have any worries.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,240
But what do you think of me?

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
You.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,160
Do I look like

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
Si Si?

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Of course you do.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
What's the difference?

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,480
You are not my classmate.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,680
Then who am I to you?

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,200
You are...

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm the one you called.

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm your neighbor.

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm your neighbor.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,080
I wrote a novel with you.

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,160
I...

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't know what to say.

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
But you and I

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
are not like we don't care about each other.

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
You want to be my brother too?

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,880
Who wants to be your brother?

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,200
Since we wrote a novel together,

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,520
you are my partner.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,480
Partner.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,680
How is it?

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm the only partner.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm different from others.

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,040
Forget it.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,760
At least we are the only partners.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,480
At present?

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm here.

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,320
Why do you want to find others?

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,480
How's your novel?

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Is it ready?

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,920
I... I wrote an opening.

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Why didn't you tell me

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
when you started writing?

61
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,920
I think you won't like it.

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
What did you write?

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,240
What did you write?

64
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,880
What's supposed to come will come.

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
You can laugh at me if you want.

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,320
Let me make it clear.

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
After Xiao Budi defeated the black man,

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
the rest of the story is all about art.

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,280
I don't want to blame you.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
Of course I know.

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,240
You know?

72
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,200
That's good.

73
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
What do you think about the writing?

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,640
It's okay.

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,760
It's good in the novel I read.

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,640
But your novel

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,240
is too good.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not real at all.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
But it's okay.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,520
I can help you with this line.

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,840
Really?

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,160
I think I'm a little bit disappointed.

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,280
Don't be too happy.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
It's just the beginning.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
What about you?

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
How about this?

87
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Come to the meeting with me every night.

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,160
Start from the beginning of the novel.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
You wrote it so casually.

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Lie Dagang.

91
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
When did you become so professional?

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,240
I promised you to do it well.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,640
Of course I'll do it carefully.

94
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
One more thing.

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,800
Is the character name in your novel called the original name?

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
Lu Zichen is a villain this time.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
You're right.

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,640
Lu Zichen, what did he change into?

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Just delete his name.

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Anyway, people in it call him boss.

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,320
It's no use keeping this name.

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay.

103
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Can you still call the heroine Nan Xiaoxin?

104
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,760
Yes.

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,760
What did Xiao Wudi change into?

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,240
Just call me Mr. He Huan.

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,440
Okay, Mr. He Huan.

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
Is there anything else to change?

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,360
If not, I'll go back first.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,520
No?

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
Wait.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,960
See you tomorrow.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,400
See you tomorrow.

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
I knew it.

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,640
My impression of him changed.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
He's handsome.

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,280
Right.

118
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,680
See, there is AD disabilities.

119
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
What's that?

120
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,880
It's for women.

121
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Right?

122
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
There's another one.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,280
This one?

124
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
This one.

125
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,280
Okay.

126
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
You're a boy.

127
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,000
You're a boy.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Why do you add a boy?

129
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,600
It's cute.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,240
What's it called?

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
A big boy?

132
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
I have one, too.

133
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
It's Xiao Wu Jin.

134
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,520
There's no boy's name.

135
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,560
Why do you add a boy?

136
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,040
I want to be cute, too.

137
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,480
You're so cute.

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,880
Xiao Wu Jin.

139
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Xiao Wu Jin is really good.

140
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Let's do it again.

141
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm a very happy girl.

142
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
Beauty.

143
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,800
Play with me.

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,880
Stop.

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,480
She's my hostage.

146
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
From now on,

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,000
you're my hostage.

148
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,760
Xiao Wu Jin.

149
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
I...

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,960
There is still a little bit of anxiety in front of me

151
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,760
The plot is already out of date

152
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Waiting for the new year to be expected

153
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,760
At this moment, you are willing to guess

154
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,560
How worried I am about the future every day

155
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,760
Listen to the rhythm of the heart and speed up

156
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,560
Tell me why

157
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,560
You're always by my side

158
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Maybe it's destiny

159
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,760
When I see your eyes

160
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Even the light of time and space

161
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,960
Is love

162
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Tell me why

163
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
You're always by my side

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Maybe it's destiny

165
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
When I see your eyes

166
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Even the light of time and space

167
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Is love

168
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm done

169
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Finally finished

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Do you think they will like what we wrote?

171
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Of course

172
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,160
I've done it

173
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,760
How could they not like it?

174
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,760
If only I had half the confidence as you

175
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
But I think

176
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
There is a part that we didn't write well

177
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Which part?

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
The part when we went on a date

179
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I mean the part when the character went on a date

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Why is that part not good?

181
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
It feels like it's not real

182
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,360
There is no moment of heart-to-heart when dating

183
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
But it's good now

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
It's okay

185
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I go to the toilet

186
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm afraid no one will come

187
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Can I go now?

188
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
It has been over years

189
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,360
So many people won't recognize us

190
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Radio Both team is good

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Quiet

192
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Call the other team

193
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
We better get the recording

194
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
So

195
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
If anyone doesn't come

196
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I have some requirements

197
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
So our team will invite them

198
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
I have always didnt

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,000
Mr. Ye, you're back early.

200
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,680
I came back after finishing my work.

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,880
How's it going?

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
You've been working a lot recently.

203
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
Can you still eat?

204
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Not bad.

205
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,000
My colleagues are willing to help me.

206
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
I can learn something new every day.

207
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
And I have the right to say something.

208
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,200
I've checked a lot of information.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,280
So what's your idea?

210
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
I think...

211
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,520
Do you remember

212
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,960
there was a new platform

213
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,800
looking for us?

214
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,920
Although that platform is small,

215
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,760
the copyright fee is not high.

216
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,160
But his proposal

217
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,400
is very thoughtful.

218
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
You can't convince me

219
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:57,740
about the

220
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,480
But he got the investment

221
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,360
of the well-known Feng Tou Company

222
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,000
when he was in the A-Ren financing.

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,520
Although his copyright fee is very low,

224
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,280
his後期比例分成非常地高

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,560
This can cover all the expenses.

226
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
So he has a long-term investment path.

227
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,200
I think it's a good idea.

228
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Mr. Ye,

229
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,600
I hope I can be like you.

230
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,600
You don't have to be like me.

231
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,000
It's all

232
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,720
a little bit of experience.

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,320
You just have to think a little more

234
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
in your work

235
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,040
and make more progress.

236
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
You will get everyone's approval soon.

237
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,160
Work hard.

238
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,840
Go back to your work.

239
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,560
Okay.

240
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,340
who has been working on many things.

241
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,600
Come in.

242
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,500
Secretary Ye.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,520
Have a look

244
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:11,760
at the progress of the Kelly

245
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,640
Project.

246
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,240
The theme is creative and the news is light and lively.

247
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,640
It should be considered as the most potential work

248
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,760
since we started to publish it.

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,480
It seems that we've found the treasure this time.

250
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,640
Do you want me to ask him to come in and talk?

251
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
No need.

252
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,960
Just follow the procedure and send the email.

253
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,720
Ask all the authors to meet in the company.

254
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,320
I understand.

255
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
I'll arrange for them to send it out in the afternoon.

256
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,120
Okay, go.

257
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm in!

258
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,640
The editor said that I should go to the company tomorrow to talk!

259
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Are you happy?

260
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I told you.

261
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,640
How could I not be in if I'm in?

262
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Thank you.

263
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm in!

264
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,640
The moment you want to fall in love,

265
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,640
let's go on a date tomorrow.

266
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Good morning.

267
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Let's go!

268
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,320
You can see a lot of clothes stewardesses

269
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,640
or writers.

270
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,000
But since you're newbies,

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,560
it's not easy for you to get straightated style

272
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,720
without getting used to the language.

273
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,320
Instead, this made you a little candidate.

274
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
What's quite important

275
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,260
is that you'll get the long-established character

276
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,920
and Shy지

277
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
and you'll find follow through.

278
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,320
This is your story

279
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
and the reason why it'll

280
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
pass the selection of every work.

281
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,720
In a love novel, the hero is a bit bad and is very common.

282
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,320
But in your case, the hero is directly set as a villain.

283
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,680
This is something very rare.

284
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,320
Although your writing experience is not very rich,

285
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,160
but in the processing of the Jianghu part,

286
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,440
there are also related historical details that are very old.

287
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,720
You must have done a lot of homework.

288
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
I didn't do much homework.

289
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,840
I just usually do some research.

290
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,320
Your group is really great.

291
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,760
The heroine was written by you in the book.

292
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,880
The moment of love, the moment of heartache,

293
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,720
and the entire interactive spark.

294
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
The whole editing team finished reading it.

295
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:55,900
A whole big

296
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,360
I'm waiting for your good news, Jia Ying.

297
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,520
Boss.

298
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,440
Boss.

299
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
Boss.

300
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Why are you here?

301
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,160
President Ye told us to come over to discuss the contract for the novel.

302
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,120
President Ye?

303
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,160
He's back?

304
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,640
He came back early.

305
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,360
Okay.

306
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,640
Okay, I won't see you two off.

307
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,280
Bye-bye.

308
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,120
Okay, you don't have to see me off.

309
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,520
Hurry up and go to work.

310
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm leaving.

311
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,440
Wait a minute.

312
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,600
I'll pick you up from work later.

313
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Ye Qing, you're back.

314
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
What's wrong?

315
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,560
What's wrong?

316
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,440
I came back to see you.

317
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,560
What's there to see?

318
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,960
I've already read the manuscript you reminded me of.

319
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
I didn't expect Nan Xin to write a novel.

320
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
How do you feel?

321
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,320
It's very bright.

322
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,840
But I think there's something wrong with love.

323
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,600
What's wrong?

324
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,240
The heroine in this novel

325
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,840
even though she came from ancient times,

326
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,440
her skills and abilities are outstanding.

327
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,840
This heroine,

328
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,360
besides having good physical strength,

329
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,160
is very ordinary.

330
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,600
So why would this heroine like this heroine?

331
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,720
There's no reason for love to exist.

332
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,680
I'm just telling the truth.

333
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,640
This is also about the logic of reality.

334
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
In reality, such an outstanding man

335
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,240
only likes outstanding women.

336
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
Forget it.

337
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,320
Love is really too difficult for you.

338
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,440
You're Nan Xin's favorite writer.

339
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:26,320
Your comments will affect her

340
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,000
I just want to ask you if you're going to chase me recently.

341
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,760
It's not what I said.

342
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Others are asking.

343
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,720
Then how are you going to answer?

344
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,200
It's impossible for me to answer.

345
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,400
We've only been working partners for so many years.

346
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,000
We'll be the same in the future, right?

347
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Hello?

348
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,480
Hello?

349
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Tomorrow, right?

350
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Let me see the birth certificate.

351
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,280
Okay.

352
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,480
We're just working partners?

353
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Is love this difficult?

354
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,880
Are we walking home now?

355
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,480
Don't you think the scenery tonight is pretty?

356
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,480
I don't need it. I'm not cold.

357
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
You're already wearing it.

358
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Keep it for later use.

359
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Why are you so thoughtful today?

360
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm helping you write a book.

361
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Write a book?

362
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Didn't you say you didn't have a date?

363
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,480
Writing this kind of content is particularly unreal.

364
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,800
Today, I'll take you to experience

365
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
the real world of love.

366
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
So, is this a date?

367
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Don't treat me like myself.

368
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Just treat me like Xiao Wu Di.

369
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Aren't you Xiao Wu Di?

370
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,680
I mean, you treat me like the Xiao Wu Di in the book.

371
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Right?

372
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,680
How did you write that story?

373
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,760
The male and female lead eat together,

374
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
watch movies together,

375
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
take a walk together,

376
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
and date together.

377
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,760
The male lead put on a jacket for the female lead

378
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,760
and then held hands for the first time.

379
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Do you want to try it?

380
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
What?

381
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
I'm not sure.

382
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,840
What?

383
00:22:46,760 --> 00:23:05,960
Ir

384
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
That's how it should be.

385
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
that you're happy?

386
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,880
Forget it.

387
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,520
Is this the feeling of heartbeats?

388
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,840
It's like an electric shock.

389
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Say it again.

390
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
Say it again.

391
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
This is the first time someone has confessed to me.

392
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,600
And I refused.

393
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Say it again.

394
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,720
What did you say?

395
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
Will you be my boyfriend?

396
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,720
Will you marry me?

397
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,840
Go away.

398
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,920
I want to keep her company even for a while.

399
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Take away.

400
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,680
Wait.

401
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I really want to be her boyfriend?

402
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Hello, I'm Xiao Wu Di.

403
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm the most powerful martial arts master.

404
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

405
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Wu Xin, how can you say that?

406
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
How can I say that?

407
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
I'm sorry.

408
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
What if he agrees?

409
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Then I can be with him every day.

410
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Then I have to listen to him no matter what.

411
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,960
I have to get married and have a child.

412
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Then we are completely in line.

413
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I can't.

414
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,960
What if we are in line?

415
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
No, no, no.

416
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Come in.

418
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
President Ye.

419
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Sit down.

420
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Have you seen the contract with Xiao Wu Di?

421
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Is there any problem?

422
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
I have seen it.

423
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
There should be no problem.

424
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
I think with your ability,

425
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
you can create your own music.

426
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Why do you have to add Xiao Wu Di?

427
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Xiao Wu Di,

428
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
he provided me with a lot of sources of material.

429
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
If it weren't for him,

430
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
I wouldn't be able to write this novel.

431
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Okay, then the road ahead is still long.

432
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
You have to keep going.

433
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
This is a small gold bar.

434
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
It's so cute. Where did you buy it?

435
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
This is a memory of a friend and I.

436
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
It's a long time ago.

437
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Go back to your work.

438
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Okay.

439
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm going to work.

440
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
I'll be back in a bit.

441
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Okay.

442
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
I'll see you later.

443
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Bye.

444
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Bye.

445
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Bye.

446
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Bye.

447
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Bye.

448
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Bye.

449
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Bye.

450
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Bye.

451
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Bye.

452
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Bye.

453
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Bye.

454
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Bye.

455
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Bye.

456
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Bye.

457
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Bye.

458
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,960
No wonder you haven't been able to chase her for so long.

459
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
So, have you ever been in a relationship?

460
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
What's so hard about being in a relationship?

461
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
In a relationship,

462
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
it's just two people stuck together every day.

463
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
He listens to whatever he says.

464
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Later, they get married together and have a child together.

465
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Love is to fall in love with two people.

466
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
It's hard.

467
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
After the draft is collected,

468
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
we'll have a meeting with all the authors.

469
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Mr. Xue,

470
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
you'll be in charge of the editing department.

471
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Okay.

472
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Any other questions?

473
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
No.

474
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Then, let's call it a day.

475
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Ye Qing,

476
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
I understand now.

477
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
What?

478
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
After I went back,

479
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I read a few novels about Nan Xin again.

480
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I think

481
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
the criticism I had for her

482
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
was indeed a bit too much.

483
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Look.

484
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
In the novel,

485
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
a criminal may need a reason to commit a crime.

486
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,960
But this reason may not be very sufficient.

487
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
As long as this crime becomes a fact,

488
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
then this story will also be established.

489
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
What does this have to do with my novel?

490
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
So the love story is also the same.

491
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
In a relationship,

492
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,960
even if one thinks that their relationship will not have a result,

493
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
as long as this love becomes a fact,

494
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
then this story will be established.

495
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
So don't treat me like the previous ones.

496
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
I know.

497
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Your friend.

498
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Nan Xin,

499
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
you inform Xiao Wu Di about today's meeting.

500
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Okay.

501
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
How was my feedback just now?

502
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Pretty good.

503
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
So you're not angry anymore?

504
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I'm not angry with you.

505
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Then,

506
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
are you free tomorrow?

507
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Have you forgotten what day tomorrow is?

508
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Meeting.

509
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Two days and one year.

510
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
A lonely man and a widow.

511
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm sorry.

512
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm sorry.

513
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
I'm sorry.

514
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm sorry.

518
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
I'm sorry.

519
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm sorry.

520
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
I'm sorry.

521
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I'm sorry.

522
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm sorry.

523
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
I'm sorry.

524
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
I'm sorry.

528
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm sorry.

529
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I'm sorry.

532
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm sorry.

533
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm sorry.

535
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm sorry.

537
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
No, no.

540
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
This is too embarrassing.

541
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Nanxing.

542
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
What's wrong?

543
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Why is your ear so red?

544
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Are you having a fever?

545
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Is that a dream?

546
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
No.

547
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Miss, I...

548
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I've worn too much clothes.

549
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
It's hot.

550
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm going to work.

551
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Hot?

552
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
Miss, I...

553
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm too hot.

554
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,120
I'll go to work.

555
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
It's hot.

556
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
I sent you the final proposal.

557
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm reading it.

558
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,240
Do you want to ask him out or not?

559
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,720
It's a good change.

560
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,480
If there's no problem,

561
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,240
I'll take care of it.

562
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,440
I'll send it to the company tomorrow.

563
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
Okay.

564
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,200
It's still early.

565
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,360
You must be hungry.

566
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,880
I'll make something for you.

567
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Okay.

568
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
I'll help you.

569
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
What do you want to eat?

570
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,680
I want to eat ham sausage and egg pancakes.

571
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Okay.

572
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,800
Do you know how to

573
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,600
open the water tank in a second?

574
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Okay.

575
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
You're great.

576
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Well,

577
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
the novel is in a bad spot.

578
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
So, next...

579
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,120
There's no problem with the novel.

580
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
We can have a rest.

581
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
A rest?

582
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Yes.

583
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Okay.

584
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,840
Then you don't have to come here anymore.

585
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,400
I don't have to come here.

586
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,760
Unless you need my help.

587
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,920
I don't need your help.

588
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,480
He really doesn't come here.

589
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,160
I'll ask him out.

590
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Xia Wu Di.

591
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Yes.

592
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,240
Put the sausage in.

593
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Okay.

594
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Add some seasoning.

595
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,840
What should I do?

596
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,920
Should I tell him or not?

597
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I won't tell him.

598
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,520
It's not appropriate anyway.

599
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Tell him.

600
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Tell him directly.

601
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
No.

602
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,520
Then he'll ask me

603
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,120
why I didn't tell him directly.

604
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
I'll explain it to him.

605
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
Help.

606
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
It's so troublesome.

607
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,920
Can't he ask me directly?

608
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I...

609
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,800
I called you again.

610
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
It's obvious.

611
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,000
You asked me to ask you directly.

612
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
What did I ask you?

613
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
Do you have something to tell me?

614
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
No.

615
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Stop pretending.

616
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Tell me.

617
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
Our company wants to organize

618
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
all the writers who are in.

619
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
To attend the contest.

620
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Two days and one night.

621
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Do you want to go?

622
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,400
Two days and one night.

623
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
It's okay if you don't want to go.

624
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
I just want to go.

625
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
I just want to go.

626
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Go.

627
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
I've been writing novels for you recently.

628
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm so tired.

629
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,800
Of course I need to relax.

630
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Okay.

631
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Go.

632
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You're not going?

633
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I...

634
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,800
I haven't decided yet.

635
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,000
You asked me to go.

636
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You...

637
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I want to sleep.

638
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,400
You go back.

639
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,800
No.

640
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
You asked me if I wanted to go.

641
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
You're not going.

642
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Nan Xin.

643
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
What's that sound?

644
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Nothing.

645
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Mom.

646
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,000
Nan Xin.

647
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
What's that sound?

648
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
It's so loud.

649
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Liu Laomao ran away.

650
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,400
Let's not play in the window.

651
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Da Huang?

652
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,800
He hasn't been here for a long time.

653
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
I'll go and have a look.

654
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
He left after playing for a while.

655
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
He left?

656
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,000
He'll come again.

657
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You call me.

658
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,800
I'm sleepy.

659
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm so sleepy.

660
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Go to sleep.

661
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Good night, mom.

662
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Good night.

663
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,800
What do you mean by you haven't decided yet?

664
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
You go back first.

665
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,800
It's not good to be seen by my mom.

666
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Go.

667
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Wait.

668
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Go.

669
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
You have to think about it.

670
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Do you understand?

671
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
I understand.

672
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
What am I going to do tomorrow?

673
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I shouldn't have done that.

674
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
I know.

675
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,200
I'll ask her again.

676
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Have you decided yet?

677
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Are you going or not?

678
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Good morning.

679
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Xiao Xiong.

680
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Aunt.

681
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
Why are you taking so many things?

682
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Let me help you, aunt.

683
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Okay.

684
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,800
Why didn't Nan Xin help you?

685
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Nan Xin left early in the morning.

686
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm so forgetful.

687
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Let me help you, aunt.

688
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Okay.

689
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Sorry to bother you.

690
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
It's okay, aunt.

691
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I should do it.

692
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
When you take it to send people,

693
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
it's quite heavy upstairs and downstairs.

694
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Just call me if you need anything.

695
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I can't bother you with anything.

696
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
I can just take it to the group several times.

697
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
It's really okay.

698
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Is this okay?

699
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Yes.

700
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
You're so lucky.

701
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
You're much better than Nan Xin.

702
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Where did she go today?

703
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,800
She said she went to the school for the school anniversary.

704
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
School anniversary?

705
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Does everyone go?

706
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Not everyone goes back.

707
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
If everyone goes back,

708
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
how can the school be in good shape?

709
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Nan Xin is so warm-hearted.

710
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
She goes back to help every year.

711
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I think it's good for her to go back and play.

712
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Okay.

713
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Come on, class, put the balloons on both sides.

714
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Teacher Cheng!

715
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Hello, Nan Xin.

716
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Long time no see.

717
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Are you still arranging?

718
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
You came early this year.

719
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
School hasn't been arranged well yet.

720
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
It's okay.

721
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Then I'll just walk around.

722
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Do you need my help?

723
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm sorry.

724
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
You can send this to Teacher Zhang.

725
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
Okay, no problem.

726
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Don't forget

727
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
the school anniversary is held in the new district this year.

728
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Don't go wrong.

729
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Okay, see you later.

730
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,760
Come here.

731
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,760
Yes, the balloon is here. Put it here.

732
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,760
Did you find that

733
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,720
Nanxing has been

734
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,400
in a bad mood recently?

735
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,320
Is it related to that novel?

736
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,800
She is always in a bad mood

737
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,880
when she writes novels.

738
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,960
It must be that her recent novel plot

739
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,560
has been not going well.

740
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,440
What plot?

741
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,880
Tell me about it.

742
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,360
Maybe I can help you.

743
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,880
It's her love line.

744
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,240
Maybe she doesn't have any inspiration.

745
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,400
You should ask me.

746
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,920
I have experience.

747
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,320
She has been rejected

748
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,600
after she has been in love once.

749
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,760
She has been in love for the first time?

750
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,600
I thought she was single all the time.

751
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,680
She has been single

752
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,800
because she failed in love.

753
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,480
Then who did she fall in love with?

754
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,760
Who else?
