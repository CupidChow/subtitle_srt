[Episode 2]

4
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,130
Why are you...

5
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
What's your name?

6
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,380
My name is Nan Xing.

7
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,420
Nan Xing.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,030
Are you the answer I'm looking for?

9
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,580
[What answer?]

10
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,300
[What does he mean?]

11
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,550
Even if you can't have my heart,

12
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,770
you can still have me,

13
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,460
right?

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,380
I...

15
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,770
You really don't want to have me?

16
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,700
Consider it

17
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,840
my way of repaying you for saving my life.

18
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,300
No way!

19
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,340
[This guy]

20
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,010
[must be talking nonsense again.]

21
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,210
[You think I will be scared, don't you?]

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
So what if yes?

23
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,300
As expected.

24
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,500
But how did she do it

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,070
with her intelligence?

26
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,160
Who are you talking about?

27
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,620
What's wrong with my intelligence?

28
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,750
You've been stuck here for a long time?

29
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,820
No.

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,860
Do you need help?

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,730
No.

32
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,180
I can do it myself.

33
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,030
You really don't need help?

34
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,300
Just stay away from me.

35
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,910
Alright.

36
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,380
I'll stand here waiting for you.

37
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,020
Mister,

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,980
can you do me a favour?

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,750
What's wrong with you guys?

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,230
Did you have a fight?

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,780
She's mad at me.

42
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,700
Shut up.

43
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,500
No.

44
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,980
I don't know him, mister.

45
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,550
Mister.

46
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't go.

47
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,340
Miss,

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,980
can you do me a favour?

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,420
Hi, can you...

50
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,380
I...

51
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,700
You should have asked me
to help you earlier.

52
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,260
You...

53
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,900
Do I owe you money?

54
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,500
Can you stop following me?

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,740
Can you tell me now?

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,700
Tell what?

57
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Tell me how you

58
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,660
summoned me to this world.

59
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,380
Summoned?

60
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,740
World?

61
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,800
Which mental institution

62
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,020
did you run away from?

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,500
No wonder you're dressed like this.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,540
This is

65
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
the 21st century.

66
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,940
I came from the reign of

67
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,100
Zhengde of the Ming Dynasty.

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,820
It is 500 years from now.

69
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,580
Everyone dresses like this

70
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,300
in the world I belong to.

71
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,740
You really can't understand all this

72
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,260
with your intelligence.

73
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,220
So when I questioned you just now,

74
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,340
you were talking nonsense?

75
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,220
You...

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,180
You say you're an ancient?

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,820
I know

78
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,420
that time travel is still

79
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,340
unattainable

80
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,690
for people of this era.

81
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,020
But I am indeed

82
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,340
an ancient.

83
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,780
Assuming what you say is true,

84
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,659
I mean assuming,

85
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,180
what does that have to do with me?

86
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,780
Because there is a good chance

87
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,100
that the person who summoned me is you.

88
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,620
Why?

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Do you remember yesterday when you said

90
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,140
you saw me in the water in a dream

91
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,380
and woke up

92
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,540
to find me in your arms?

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,730
Who are you?

94
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,980
Yes.

95
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,500
I still haven't

96
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
figured that out.

97
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,620
That was the first summoning.

98
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,580
First?

99
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,300
Is there a second time?

100
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,700
Just now,

101
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,340
I appeared behind you out of nowhere.

102
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,900
Don't you ever wonder?

103
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,580
I thought you were a stalker.

104
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,130
I was

105
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,659
in the library

106
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,540
and the next thing I knew
I was on the street.

107
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,740
This is the response to your summoning.

108
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,580
How is this possible?

109
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,280
This is too unscientific.

110
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,700
Gosh. Stop displaying
affection in public.

111
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,730
Please.

112
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,580
Did you say that?

113
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,980
How could you hear me?

114
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,659
Who are you?

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,480
Don't come any closer.

116
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,700
Tell me who you really are.

117
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,690

[Xiao Wudi.]

129
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,220
How did this all happen?

130
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,780
Because I made a wish?

131
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,980
But how can this be a wish?

132
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,660
What did you wish for?

133
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,020
Why are you following me?

134
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,710
I thought

135
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,020
I had got rid of you.

136
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,980
I'm a famous man

How can you get rid of me?

139
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,820
Why do you have to pester me?

140
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,300
If you're really an ancient,

141
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,780
you should be happy.

142
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,980
We have good food,

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
nice clothes

144

and medical equipment.

145
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,460
You can enjoy

modern life

147
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,220
to the fullest here.

148
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,480
I don't want to be here.

149
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,790
I want to go back.

150
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,140
Go ahead then.

151
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,659
You summoned me here,

152
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,620
how do you expect me
to get back on my own?

153
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,740
I'm not capable of that.

154
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,780
I know you aren't capable of that.

155
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
So you must have

156
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,750
accidentally triggered something.

157
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,740
Now think about it.

158
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,060
What happened

159
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,380
last night?

160
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Last night,

161
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,340
I came over to make a wish.

162
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,420
Make a wish?

163
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,500
You didn't

164
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,850
wish for a handsome man

165
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,460
from heaven, did you?

166
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,420
Aren't you ashamed

167
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,380
to say that?

168
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,540
Aren't you ashamed to make such a wish?

169
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,300
I didn't make such a wish.

170
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,260
I made a wish

171
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,520
that I would pass my interview today.

172
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,220
Then, I met

173
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,180
a couple

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,580
and got irritated by them.

175
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,450
Then, I

176
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,880
said...

177
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,540
What's the big deal about falling in love?

178
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,980
I would like to fall in love

179
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,940
if I could.

180
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,820
I want an

181
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,380
unforgettable love too.

182
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,270
What did you say?

183
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,700
I said something casual.

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,590
What's that?

185
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,760
I've forgotten it.

186
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,419
It's not important.

187
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,600
The important thing is

188
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
that I dropped my coins in there.

189
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,220
Then, I had a dream

190
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,840
while I was looking for it.

191
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,580
[I saw you in the water in my dream.]

192
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
You're next to me again

193
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,460
when I woke up.

194
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,700
This coin has been in my hand

195
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,380
since I first woke up.

196
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,980
You said you saw me in a dream?

197
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,020
Yes.

198
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,060
How did you do it?

199
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,540
You are a hypnotist,

200
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,170
virtual reality,

201
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,860
magician,

202
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,660
-or...
-Cut the crap.

203
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,220
Come on.

204
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,380
What?

205
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,530
I...

206
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,580
This is my...

207
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,580
Do it all again

208
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,260
to send me back.

209
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,970
[Let's give it a go.]

210
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,120
[Let's just play along with him.]

211
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,170
[Dear fairy,]

212
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,300
[if it was you]

213
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,960
[who brought Xiao Wudi here,]

214
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
[please take him back the same way.]

215
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,940
[I can't handle]

216
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,460
[this gift.]

217
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,790
[I beg you, please.]

218
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,820
After that?

219
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,740
Throw it in.

220
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,900
This is precious. I can't...

221
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,100
Look.

222
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
Nothing happens.

223
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,520
I told you it had nothing to do with me.

224
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,910
Now, it's time to dream.

225
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,740
That's not something
you can do just like that.

226
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,340
You can do it while you sleep.

227
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
It's not a good idea for us to do this.

228
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,740
If anyone sees us

229
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,180
lying here,

230
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,140
they'll think we're
committing suicide for love.

231
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,900
Do you want me to go back or not?

232
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,220
I do.

233
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,700
But how can I fall asleep like this?

234
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,530
Is there nothing you can do

235
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,700
if you can't sleep?

236
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,690
Tortoise Breathing Technique.

237
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,860
I can definitely fall asleep

238
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,900
between three breaths.

239
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,740
Don't worry about me.

240
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,780
You should sleep first.

241
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,940
Where am I?

242
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,820
Is this still Fairy Fountain Park?

243
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,660
How did I get here?

244
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,280
My place is quite nice, right?

245
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,100
Mister,

246
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,260
why are you here?

247
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,740
Why can't I be here?

248
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
This is my fairyland.

249
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,180
Of course I'm here.

250
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,580
Let me formally introduce myself.

251
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,180
I'm Fairy Zhen.

252
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,670
What have you done to me?

253
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,740
Why did you

254
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,820
bring me here?

255
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,500
Didn't you ask for

256
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,720
an unforgettable love yourself?

257
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,860
So I got Xiao Wudi

258
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,930
for you.

259
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,140
Xiao Wudi?

260
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,060
An unforgettable love?

261
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,390
He's handsome, right?

262
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,220
I'll fight you.

263
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,580
You...

264
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,370
You...

265
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,850
You

266
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,780
bite the hand that feeds you, huh?

267
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,460
You're being ungrateful, aren't you?

268
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,180
You're pissing me off.

269
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,620
Anyway, I don't want to be in love

270
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,220
with Xiao Wudi.

271
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
What's wrong with

272
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,940
Xiao Wudi?

273
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,900
He's Young Master Hehuan.

274
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,340
He's a handsome and intelligent man

275
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,780
with outstanding skills in both literary

276
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,700
and martial arts.

277
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,430
What is it about Xiao Wudi
that makes him unworthy

278
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,380
of a discus girl like you
who has never been in love?

279
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,780
He's a bad guy!

280
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,620
I wrote it myself.

281
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,350
Don't I know what he's like?

282
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,220
Devious and sinister,

283
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,420
full of mischief and ill will.

284
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,580
Do you like him?

285
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,940
We all

286
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,590
have our shortcomings,

287
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,220
right?

288
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,990
Be tolerant.

289
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,940
I just don't want him anyway.

290
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,130
I don't want him.

291
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,660
Take him back.

292
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,060
I can't take him back.

293
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,150
My magical powers are limited too.

294
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,480
Since it has happened,

295
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,340
You... You'll just have to
make do with him.

296
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,140
Why?

297
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,800
How could this happen to me

298
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,540
in my

299
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,530
great years of youth?

300
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,300
What am I going to do?

301
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,060
Actually, there is good news.

302
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,140
Human beings are very vulnerable.

303
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,670
A lifetime is not that long.

304
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,540
Humans have a short life span.

305
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,980
You just face it like this.

306
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,970
Put up with it for the rest of your life.

307
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,300
May you have long legs

308
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,660
in your next life.

309
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,260
Okay?

310
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,380
Long legs, huh?

311
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,260
Wait here.

312
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,940
What are you...

313
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,420
You...

314
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,060
Does it make sense for you to do this?

315
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,580
I am the fairy here.

316
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,060
Let me be frank.

317
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,020
Xiao Wudi

318
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,900
is the best match for you

319
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,500
in the world.

320
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,300
Get along well with him.

321
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,460
Cherish the time you spend with him.

322
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,350
Besides,

323
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,380
you can't stay much longer

324
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,460
in my place.

325
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,860
Take this back with you.

326
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,340
The dream was real.

327
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,860
No.

328
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,300
No.

329
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,500
I don't want him!

330
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,820
You're back.

331
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,460
Nan Xing,

332
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,560
what's wrong with you?

333
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,110
Are you alright?

334
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,980
You don't have a fever, right?

335
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,660
No.

336
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,460
Alright, you don't have a fever.

337
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,790
I thought you had a cold.

338
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,900
No.

339
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,460
I'm just a little too tired

340
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,920
from the interview today.

341
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,660
Would you like something to eat then?

342
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
I'll make you something.

343
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,700
It's fine.

344
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,180
I want to take a nap.

345
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,540
[Maybe]

346
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,710
[her interview didn't go well today.]

347
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,980
I'm going out of town

348
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,060
with the dance team tomorrow.

349
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,340
Would you like to join us?

350
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,800
Let's get away for a break.

351
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,140
I'm good.

352
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,700
I don't feel like going out much lately.

353
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,060
Alright.

354
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,100
Take a break then.

355
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,230
Have a good rest.

356
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,740
Okay.

357
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,500
Call me if you need anything.

358
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,220
Right.

359
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,740
All I have to do is delete the novel,

360
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,869
and the character will cease to exist.

361
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,500
Yes, delete it and I'll be fine.

362
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,069

It's deleted.

368
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,500
This should make him disappear.

369
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,840
Should I go out and have a look?

370
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,620
No.

371
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,080
What if he doesn't disappear?

372
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,910
What if he can still find me?

373
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,340
That can't be.

374
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,530
I'm at home now.

375
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,860

As long as I'm home,

379
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm safe.

380
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,340
I won't go out.

381
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,850
I won't go out.

I won't go out.

Sorry about yesterday.

398
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,930
I was in a hurry

399

to get back

It's okay.

Not really.

525
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,300
being adapted for films.

526
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,980
I've heard

527
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,580
that some of the most
popular young talents

528
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
have already made it

529
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,020
to the casting call.

530
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,420
Is it true?

531
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,420
Yes.

532
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,710
But I don't think they can do it.

533
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,820
There is still

534
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,380
a serious public outcry.

535
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,850
Jiao and I

536
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,140
have also made some proposals

537
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,300
to discuss

538
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,700
how to deal with this problem.

539
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,300
We don't have to deal with it.

540
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,580
Boss,

541
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,980
we're not afraid of being scolded.

542
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,340
It's just that their head office

543
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,140
is very close to

544
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,060
one of the investors of our film.

545
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,220
They are now

546
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,260
a tad unhappy

547
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,420
with your statement.

548
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,780
Commercial department warns

549
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,510
of the risk of

550
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,860
disinvestment at any time.

551
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,580
It's okay.

552
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,780
They were the ones

553
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,060
who let the news out.

554
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,420
There is a big difference

555
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,260
between these candidates

556
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,590
and the image of Ma Leng.

557
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,940
Based on the protection of the work

558
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,780
and the character,

559
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,310
there's no problem
with the boss's response.

560
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,500
Besides, things are still up in the air,

561
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,690
but they're making hype

562
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,620
out of our book.

563
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,940
We should consider

564
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,500
whether we should continue

565
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,160
to work with such an investor.

566
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,500
Our company's goal this year

567
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,900
is still to select new authors.

568
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,840
Ye Qing and I

569
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,090
founded X-Culture

570
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
not to sell the rights to make films,

571
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,500
but to give more young writers

572
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,540
like me back then

573
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,220
a chance

574
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,340
to write good works

575
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,940
and make a better life.

576
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,260
You all may continue.

577
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,900
That's all for today.

578
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,590
Dismiss.

579
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,140
Jiao,

580
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,650
how's the president's office
doing with the recruitment?

581
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,340
Quite good.

582
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,380
HR just gave me
a few profiles of graduates

583
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,980
from prestigious universities.

584
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,530
They are also good in all aspects.

585
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,420
Is there someone named Nan Xing

586
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,260
in the list of assistant to the president?

587
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,540
Nan Xing?

588
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,590
I don't think so.

589
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,710
I'll look for it.

590
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,060
No, as I recall.

591
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,520
All the profiles of candidates are here.

592
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,100
As I said, no.

593
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,940
I think she was on the list

594
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,900
for the initial interview.

595
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,220
Show me her profile.

596
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,680
[Takeaway]

597
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,660
[Today's spending: 1070 yuan]

598
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,780
[I'm going broke.]

599
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,420
[I'm going to be broke]

600
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,820
[before I can find a job.]

601
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,140
[I don't know if there's love,]

602
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,140
[but these are enough to make him]

603
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,740
[etched in my heart.]

604
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,220
Mr. Xiao,

605
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,960
is that all you can eat?

606
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,770
Would you like some more?

607
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,100
I don't have a good appetite

608
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,580
in the morning.

609
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,340
So why did you ask me to order so much?

610
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,900
Is it still a human life

611
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,510
to have less than 10 dishes for breakfast?

612
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,220
[If I had known this,
I would have written you]

613
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,020
[as a lackey of a beggar's gang.]

614
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,330
[Just go out and beg for food yourself.]

615
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,230
You seem to have
a good sense of propriety.

616
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,980
I'm done eating.

617
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,350
Those leftovers

618
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,850
are yours to enjoy.

619
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,100
You're treating me

620
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,030
like your servant now, aren't you?

621
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,810
I'm not treating you like a servant.

622
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,180
You're not worthy

623
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,780
of being my servant.

624
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,580
You're just my hostage.

625
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,510
Do you know what hostage means?

626
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,980
I do.

627
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,220
Don't eat.

628
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,140
Clean up and come to me.

629
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Go to you?

630
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,380
Where are you going?

631
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
Where are you going?

632
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,770
Take a bath and change my clothes.

633
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,580
Don't use

634
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,240
other people's bathroom.

635
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,260
You don't know how to use

636
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,720
the modern shower we have.

637
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,000
What's so difficult about it?

638
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,900
You'd better go out.

639
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,700
Don't try to scare me with this.

640
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,060
Am I trying to scare you?

641
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,500
Pervert.

642
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,430
Stand there.

643
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,780
Did I tell you to leave?

644
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,340
I've noticed that you have all these

645
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
flush toilet,

646
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,820
water heater

647
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,340
and bathtub

648
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,660
in one set.

649
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,900
This generation of yours

650
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,460
has more pleasure

651
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,020
than the Emperor of Ming.

652
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,500
How do you know everything?

653
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,020
I am a man who has been to

654
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,950
the library.

655
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,380
You've been to the library

656
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,980
and you know everything?

657
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,610
Well, not everything.

658
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
For example, there's one thing

659
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,440
I don't understand right now.

660
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,780
What is it?

661
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,300
Why are you still wearing a blindfold?

662
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,500
Is it because I'm not good-looking

663
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,410
or because you're afraid to look at me?

664
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,580
What am I afraid to look at?

665
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,650
I am a modern adult woman,

666
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,320
what am I afraid to look at?

667
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,980
I'll look at you now.

668
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,210
You're good at saying tongue twisters.

669
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,700
Since you've got your clothes on,

670
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,570
get out now.

671
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,460
Thank you.

672
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,360
No problem.

673
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,140
Xiao Wudi!

674
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,580
This is TV?

675
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,070
You can learn it all without a teacher?

676
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm an ancient,

677
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
not an idiot.

678
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,200
A little research

679
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,540
into such tricks is all that is required.

680
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,220
[Yes, I'm the idiot now.]

681
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,470
Good.

682
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,710
Come here.

683
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,360
What is good?

684
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,260
Why did you ask me to go there?

685
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,880
Your mother should

686
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,900
want to talk to me.

687
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,430
Get me a pair of scissors.

688
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,620
While I'm in there,

689
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,780
go and get

690
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,260
some men's clothes.

691
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,510
What do you need scissors for?

692
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,340
Judging by the situation,

693
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
I'll have to stay here for a while.

694
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,570
I can't appear

695
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,700
as an ancient person every day, right?

696
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,160
No men's clothes in our house.

697
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,420
Aren't there two men there?

698
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,620
They are both

699
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,330
gone.

700
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,320
You have to think of a way then.

701
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,660
How am I going to think of a way for you?

702
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,700
If you can't think of a way out,

703
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,130
you're on your own.

704
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,780
How am I

705
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,260
going to think of a way for you?

706
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,530
I have a new idea.

707
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
After the murder,

708
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,120
Su Yu dived into

709
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,140
the deep sea of the Great Blue Hole
to investigate the case.

710
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,510
By then,

711
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,970
she would have found the key clue

712
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,700
at the bottom of the sea

713
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,740
but sunk in danger.

714
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,020
Will Ma Leng save her?

715
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:14,990
Of course.

716
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,320
I've pretty much thought

717
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,480
of a way to save her.

718
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,810
But there is one key question

719
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,330
that I think needs to be

720
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,440
discussed further.

721
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,120
So I thought that tonight...

722
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:22,930
Come in.

723
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:23,890
Miss Ye.

724
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:24,730
Mr. Lu.

725
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,070
This is the document you want.

726
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,400
Are you free tonight?

727
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,440
Let's have dinner

728
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,970
and talk.

729
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,020
Can we make it tomorrow?

730
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,650
I've got a date tonight.

731
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,450
Alright.

732
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,930
Wait a minute.

733
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,230
Miss Ye,

734
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,970
today is your birthday, right?

735
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,410
Yes.

736
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,230
Happy birthday to you.

737
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,920
Thank you.

738
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,850
The boss is quite harsh.

739
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,600
[Nan Xing.
Job Search: Assistant to the President]

740
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,610
Nobody would ask someone

741
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,660
for a work dinner on his birthday.

742
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,520
Why?

743
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,450
You want to buy me dinner too?

744
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,770
No.

745
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,300
That's not what I meant.

746
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,050
Miss Ye, go ahead with your work,

747
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,170
I'll get back to my work now.

748
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:19,680
Bye.

749
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,690
I've arrived.

750

Come on, take it.

751
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,280
Si Si.

752
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,690
As soon as I got your call,

753
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,690
I rushed to take it off

of Hao.

755
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,480
How is it? Is that okay?

756
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,140
No problem.

757
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,400
What are you doing?

758
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,450
I'm going to the toilet.

759
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,130
I can't hold back anymore.

760
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,130
Go to McDonald's.

761
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,900
McDonald's?

762
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,610
Nan Xing, I want to use the toilet

763
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,330
and you ask me to go to McDonald's?

764
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,460
My toilet is broken.

765
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,210
Nan Xing,

766
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,030
there are so many food.

767
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,130
That's my leftover supper

768
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,060
from yesterday.

769
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,490

[Where are the clothes?]

Just go to McDonald's.

773
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Is that the stench

774
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,210
of love I smell?

[have you got for me?]

If you want to wear international brands,

781
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,320
you should kidnap a rich woman.

Okay?

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,530

You don't have to explain it.

You know everything.

Who is this guy?

840
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,530
Try to think

841
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,800
of any other specific characteristics

842
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,660
of the person that you can recall.

843
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,650
It's definitely not him.

844
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,010
The tattoo on his hand is different

845
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,370
from that of the thief.

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,410
Why don't you come back
to the office with me

849
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,010

However, this robbery ring

Yes, I have.

Stay safe.

860
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,770
This robbery ring is in fact

861
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,480
related to the last ram-raiding

862

No, not yet.

-Bye.
-Bye.

869

However,

870
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,370
these bad guys must not be allowed

871
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,760
to get away with it so easily.

872
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,220
I got it.

873
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,130
Besides,

874
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,220
why do I feel like

875
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,170
a lot of people in our division

876
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:29,930
know you?

877
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,930
You've just been transferred here

878
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,130
and don't know it yet.

879
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,890
Nan Xing is amazing.

880
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,450
She has helped us catch a lot of bad guys

881
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,050
and is our crime buster here.

882
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,090
No, you flatter me.

883
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,850
Especially now.

884
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,570
It's unexpected.

885
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,650
Come, this way.

886
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,180
[Chinese Handsome Boy]

887
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,130
Mister,

888
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,210
how can I help you?

889
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,490
You are a shop assistant, right?

890
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,770
This.

891
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,040
Mister,

892
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,650
have you decided which one you want?

893
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:44,790
All of them.

894
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,330
Can he afford them?

895
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,810
Count the money

896
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,170
you need.

897
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,930
Mister,

898
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,840
please wait a minute.

899
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,570
Quick, make him a cup of coffee.

900
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,000
[With money,
you can do anything you like.]

901
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,500
[It's been 500 years,]

902
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,260
[human nature never changes.]

903
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,600
I wonder if Xiao Wudi is causing me

904
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,250
any trouble at home.

905
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,290
Nothing good has happened to me

906
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,690
since he's been here.

907
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,450
He's going to put me in danger

908
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,850
one day.

909
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,210
Dear fairy,

910
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,040
you sent him here

911
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,610
to punish me, right?

912
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,610
Hello.

913
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,180
Who is speaking?

914
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,050
[Are you Nan Xing?]

915
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,690
Yes.

916
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:33,770
[Hi.]

917
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,010
[I am a HR officer of X-Culture.]

918
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,050
[You came to our company yesterday]

919
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,730
[for an interview for the position
of assistant to the president,]

920
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,260
[right?]

921
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,330
Yes.

922
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,370
[I'm calling to inform you]

923
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,100
[that you have been selected.]

924
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,970
Sorry.

925
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,050
I'm too excited.

926
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,960
I thought I had failed.

927
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,330
[You are indeed selected.]

928
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,730
[Full details]

929
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,010
[are in the email.]

930
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
[It has been sent]

931
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,650
[to your email address.]

932
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:01,730
Okay.

933
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:02,700
Alright.

934
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I'll check it now.

935
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,580
Yes, I have received it.

936
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,050
[If there is no problem,]

937
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,930
[we will wait for you]

938
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,370
[to report to the office tomorrow.]

939
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,920
Okay. Thank you!

940
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,560
It's true.

941
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,490
X-Culture.

942
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,290
Senior Lu.

943
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:23,930
He didn't recognise me,

944
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,010
did he?

945
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,730
He didn't see me

946
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,700
at the book signing event, did he?

947
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,010
No, I can't do this.

948
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,200
People will think

949
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,530
I got in by the back door.

950
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,580
Stand there!

951
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,170
Don't run!

952
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,990
Don't come any closer.

953
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,350
Don't come any closer.

954
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,020
I've called the police.

955
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,770
Fire.

956
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,250
Help.

957
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,810
Help.
