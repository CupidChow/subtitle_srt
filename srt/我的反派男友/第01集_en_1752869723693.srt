1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm sorry.

By Yuan Ren

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,480
It's okay you to stand in the line right.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
Hao loves him Fußstie

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,600
the son of an idiot

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
Hydra

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,940
Four bad boys

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
with needless help

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,600
played Chinese SAT numa

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,080
by Yuan�

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,880
Let Yuan Ren

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,200
give the rooms

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,400
to Yuan Ren

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,640
siempre

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,400
school

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,200
darling

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
let I

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
I know.

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Is he looking at me?

49
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:25,660
Are you going to the

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,680
This is the legendary fan?

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Are you a college student nearby?

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm from the university.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm an athlete.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
No wonder you're so good.

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
You're a man's sports club, right?

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
I heard that there's a national dance business.

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
You're not going to learn that, are you?

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
I can't guess what project you're learning.

59
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm actually learning.

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Are you okay?

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
It's okay.

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
You stop.

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Zhuang Xiaotong.

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm not going to.

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
The signing is about to start.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
I'll go first.

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Didn't we say we'd go together?

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
I think the door is not locked.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I'll go first.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
It hurts.

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
So, sister.

72
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Did you send him to the hospital?

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah.

74
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I sent him to the hospital first.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Then I went to the police station to make a note.

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
I didn't even get to the signing.

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
You didn't even get to the signing.

78
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Sister.

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
You're going to be a police officer again.

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
The coach's house is almost hanging down.

81
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
So what's your plan after graduation?

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,680
The coach has always wanted you to come back to the team.

83
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I've already got a plan.

84
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Tomorrow I'm going to interview Mr. Lu.

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Lu Zichen.

86
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Don't talk to me.

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Are you going to the interviewer's house?

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
He saw you in your childhood.

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
What?

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
How can I show him my stuff?

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm going to the interviewer's assistant.

92
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Assistant.

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Oh my god.

94
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
You're going to the interviewer's assistant.

95
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Assistant.

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Oh my god.

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
I didn't expect that one day you, a brain-sick fan,

98
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,680
could work with your idol while chasing your heart.

99
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
You're the brain-sick fan.

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
But I'm really happy to work for my idol.

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Sister.

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
You just graduated from college.

103
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
You haven't been on the class for a day.

104
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
How can you get into the interview?

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Guo Zihang.

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
I haven't been on the class for a day.

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
I can learn.

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
The opportunity is in front of me.

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
I have to try it.

110
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
You're so smart.

111
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Besides,

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
how happy it would be to work with your idol.

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes.

114
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
You don't understand.

115
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
You must do well in the interview tomorrow.

116
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Slow down.

117
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Slow down.

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Don't fall.

119
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm so fast.

120
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Let's go.

121
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Come on.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Mom.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Dad.

124
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Grandma.

125
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Dad.

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I bought you your favorite orange.

127
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
It's very sweet.

128
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
What are you looking at?

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
You don't like oranges.

130
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Okay. I bought you an apple.

131
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Eat more.

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Eat more.

133
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
His name is Lu Zichen.

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,680
He is the most outstanding student in the middle school.

135
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
He is the best writer in the world.

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,680
He is also the person I admire the most.

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
See you tomorrow, Brother Lu.

138
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
New comments.

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
In this era,

140
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
there are authors who use their own pen name to be the female lead.

141
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
The author is really honest.

142
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
What's wrong with this?

143
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
It was written and played.

144
00:07:48,680 --> 00:08:05,020
This

145
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
is the author's name.

146
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
I admire Lu Dada.

147
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
I admire him.

148
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
The view of the same building.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
There is no good villain in the text.

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,680
The female lead and Lu Dada are in a mess.

151
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Is the female lead serious?

152
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I don't understand why she thinks she is the top.

153
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
The character is so different.

154
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,680
She is a girl who doesn't wash her hair and bath all day.

155
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
It's her own problem.

156
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
If it's really a villain,

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,680
why don't you arrange a good opponent for Lu Dada?

158
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
All are blind guests.

159
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,680
How can you write Lu Dada's name?

160
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Okay.

161
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,680
You think I'm a villain, right?

162
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Okay.

163
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Then you are ready to welcome the great devil who has no enemies.

164
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,680
If Lu Zichen is a hero who brings light and hope to the world,

165
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,680
then this person is a poisonous snake hidden in the abyss that is like a human sword.

166
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,680
He is the devil who makes people's lives a mess.

167
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
He is the essence that pierces people's hearts.

168
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
He is the fear that makes you nothing.

169
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
He is a good martial artist.

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,680
He used his own strength to break through all the big schools.

171
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
He took the master sword of all the schools without killing anyone.

172
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,680
He made all the big schools in the world go into disrepute.

173
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I don't know how to use this sharp knife.

174
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,680
I don't need to use a knife.

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,680
But the maid said that the chef didn't use a fire stick.

176
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,680
I heard that the master of the noble sect made this knife.

177
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
I'll borrow it for a few days.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Someone once said that if this person is kind,

179
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,680
then it's a blessing for the world.

180
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,680
And he is a bad guy.

181
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,680
The purpose of his going down the mountain this time is to stir up the marriage between Nan Xiaoxing and Master Lu.

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

183
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

184
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

185
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

186
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

187
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

188
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

189
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

190
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

191
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

192
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

193
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

194
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

195
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm afraid that the master of the noble sect will be killed by the master of the noble sect.

196
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Oh.

197
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Here. Smile for me.

198
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,680
He is He Huan's son, Xiao Wu Di.

199
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
You're handsome.

200
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Mom, when did you come back?

201
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I came back after work.

202
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Hey, your writing, Xiao Wu Di, is more attractive than your male lead, Lu Zi Chen.

203
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Why?

204
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Look, first of all, he's handsome, good at martial arts, and smart.

205
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,680
He's more interesting than Lu Zi Chen, who's a real hero.

206
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
And he can also flirt.

207
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,680
But Xiao Wu Di is a bad person.

208
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
But he's handsome.

209
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,680
No, he's too evil inside.

210
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,680
The stronger this kind of person is, the more dangerous he is.

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
You can be a good son.

212
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
A man is a mother.

213
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Second, he's his wife.

214
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
They're all women.

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Why am I arguing with you here?

216
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm going to do my creation, to study my recipes.

217
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Take a break and come help me.

218
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,680
No, I want to go out for a while.

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
I'll go.

220
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,680
When I was young, you could buy some things with this money.

221
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
What's the value of money now?

222
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Even a fraud can't be so poor.

223
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
I hope I can be a good teacher one day.

224
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Make a wish.

225
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Make a wish like this?

226
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
You can show it.

227
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
You'll get the last one.

228
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I've said it many times.

229
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
I don't want money.

230
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
That's very smart.

231
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
You'll know it in a second.

232
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I've said it many times.

233
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Don't mess up my idea.

234
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Okay.

235
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
If I'm not mistaken,

236
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
you're a couple, right?

237
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Yes.

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Look, this is the local god's power, the fairy power.

239
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,680
The fairy likes to bless the couple with deep feelings.

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
We don't need to.

241
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
We're here to make wishes alone.

242
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Alone?

243
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
What's so great about love?

244
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
If I could fall in love, I'd like to.

245
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,680
I want to meet a love that's unforgettable.

246
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,680
A love that's unforgettable?

247
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Can I say something to you?

248
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
In the past, you never looked at me as you did the first time we met,

249
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
but you used to say something about life,

250
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,680
a flash of light the moment I saw you.

251
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
I never began to see it.

252
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Since we found this because you were near to me once,

253
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,680
organisms and extrac적인 skin that had just gotten different

254
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
became a plant to rest your Extension.

255
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Am I dreaming?

256
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Who is this person?

257
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Why is he here too?

258
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,080
It's Xia Song Mo again.

259
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Why is it you?

260
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
I'm still dreaming.

261
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Who are you?

262
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Why are you here?

263
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
You're alive!

264
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Are you okay?

265
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
I accidentally hit my head.

266
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
My hand is numb.

267
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Let's send him to the hospital first.

268
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
What's going on?

269
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Isn't this kind of love story only in novels?

270
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
A handsome man in the valley.

271
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
The heroine saves the man.

272
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
The heroine falls in love at first sight.

273
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
And then they make love with each other.

274
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Isn't it a bit too much to make love with each other?

275
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
No.

276
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
I have to start with a friend first.

277
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Where is this?

278
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Why am I here?

279
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Why am I still thinking about it at this time?

280
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm dreaming.

281
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Hospital.

282
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Let's send him to the hospital first.

283
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
When did you wake up?

284
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
A snow in the sky.

285
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Why didn't you say anything when you woke up?

286
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I ran so far holding you.

287
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
It's interesting to eavesdrop on others.

288
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Boring.

289
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Goodbye.

290
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Hello.

291
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Don't you wait for me to make love with you?

292
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
What are you doing?

293
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
I tell you, I am the hero of this generation.

294
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
Don't think about my idea.

295
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Hero?

296
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Which sect are you a hero in?

297
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Sujiang is big.

298
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
You go to inquire.

299
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
From the headmaster to the security guard.

300
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
Who doesn't know my male star?

301
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Male star?

302
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,680
I haven't heard of this name in the world.

303
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
This woman is dressed up.

304
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
She talks in a crazy way.

305
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
You have to be careful.

306
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
The police of the police station say I am a criminal star.

307
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
I tell you, I am a iron cake.

308
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I didn't wear an iron cake today.

309
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Otherwise, I will go down with an iron cake.

310
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
No.

311
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
What am I guilty of?

312
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
I saved you.

313
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
You said you saved me.

314
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Where did you save me?

315
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
The water is so shallow.

316
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
How can I sink in it?

317
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Even if I really sink in it.

318
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Why is my hair and clothes dry when I come out?

319
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,680
So I said I was dreaming.

320
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
What are you talking about?

321
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm not talking nonsense.

322
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I started to pick up my hard...

323
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
My hard...

324
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
It's obviously at the bottom.

325
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Why is it missing?

326
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
You are looking for this.

327
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Give it back to me.

328
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Why did you take my hard pen?

329
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
This is mine.

330
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
You are talking nonsense.

331
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
How do you prove it?

332
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
How can you be like this?

333
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
You are so cruel.

334
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
I am kind enough to send you to the hospital.

335
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
You are holding my hard pen.

336
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
You can ask me to return it.

337
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Just answer some questions.

338
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
I will answer as you ask.

339
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Why?

340
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
You.

341
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
You are in the park at night.

342
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
You are wearing an ancient costume.

343
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
What are you pretending to be?

344
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Who are you scaring?

345
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Why did she say I was wearing an ancient costume?

346
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't look good in ancient costumes.

347
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
What are you wearing?

348
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
I just wear it when I go out.

349
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
You need to wear an ancient costume?

350
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
It's the 21st century.

351
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Everyone has freedom to wear clothes.

352
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
I can wear whatever I want.

353
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
It's none of your business.

354
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
The 21st century is a year.

355
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Did I go to another dynasty?

356
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
How did you suddenly appear?

357
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Give me back my hard pen.

358
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
It seems that she really doesn't know.

359
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
If I keep messing with her,

360
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm afraid I will cause trouble.

361
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Take it.

362
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
You should have returned it to me earlier.

363
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Now we can have a good talk.

364
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
We haven't talked clearly.

365
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Why are you holding my hard pen?

366
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Why do you...

367
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Don't follow me.

368
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
But we have to talk clearly, right?

369
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Are you going to beat me to death?

370
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Who is going to beat you to death?

371
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
You can't get my heart.

372
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
It's okay to get my person, right?

373
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
You're talking nonsense.

374
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
I'm talking nonsense?

375
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Didn't you think about it when I was asleep?

376
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
I...

377
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
You really don't want to?

378
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I really don't want to?

379
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Just take it as I helped you beat me to death and saved me.

380
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
You can't.

381
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I just want to play a little bit.

382
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
I didn't expect to...

383
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
You're so good at lying.

384
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
What did I do to you?

385
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Don't take it seriously.

386
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Where is he?

387
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Where is this place?

388
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
It's different from where I used to be.

389
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
If I can get the history book here,

390
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
I can know which dynasty I'm in now.

391
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Little brother, the red light is not working.

392
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Red light.

393
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Red light?

394
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
What is this?

395
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Can we go now?

396
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
We can go now.

397
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Don't be too happy too early.

398
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
You'll see him again.

399
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Because you're destined to be together.

400
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680
It seems that you've come to this world smoothly.

401
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
This is Sujiang Library.

402
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
The history books you're looking for are all in there.

403
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
But it's so late and it's closed.

404
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
You can come tomorrow.

405
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
It doesn't matter. Thank you.

406
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Little brother, are you the bold one who plays the ancient circle?

407
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Ancient circle?

408
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I think you look good in this dress.

409
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Can I take a picture with you?

410
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Can I take a picture with you?

411
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
What is this?

412
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Forget it. Let's promise each other first.

413
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Okay.

414
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
So this is taking pictures.

415
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
So magical.

416
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Like this.

417
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Okay, thank you.

418
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
We're leaving first.

419
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Bye.

420
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Bye.

421
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Luckily, I didn't show any flaws.

422
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I don't care. Let's get down to business first.

423
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
You're back.

424
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
What's wrong?

425
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
What's wrong?

426
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Who are you with?

427
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Don't mention it.

428
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
You're a rogue.

429
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I'll beat you up when I see him next time.

430
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Then I'm relieved.

431
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
A normal rogue is really not your opponent.

432
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Mom, what are you doing?

433
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Big dishes.

434
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
I learned it from the recipes.

435
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Canbi, Michelin, and Samsung.

436
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Hello, everyone.

437
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I'm Lu Zichen.

438
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Isn't this your boyfriend?

439
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Lu Dada.

440
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Can you tell us about the next book?

441
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I can only say that this is the most difficult challenge

442
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
that Ma Erlen and Su Yu have faced.

443
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Now you've achieved such a good achievement.

444
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Is there anyone you want to thank the most?

445
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Of course, it's my longest-term partner.

446
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Our company's CEO, Ye Qing.

447
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Mr. Ye.

448
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I saw Mr. Ye has been standing on our side.

449
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
So handsome.

450
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Hello, dear.

451
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Are you going to interview your boyfriend tomorrow?

452
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
How is it?

453
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
He's not the one who's going to interview me.

454
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,680
If it's him, I'm going to be nervous.

455
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
First of all, I would like to thank all the leaders

456
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
for their support.

457
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,680
And today, I would like to thank all the fans who came to the venue.

458
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
This girl should be his girlfriend.

459
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
You mean Ye Qing?

460
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
No way.

461
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
They are classmates.

462
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
They are in the same office.

463
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,680
It doesn't look like a simple colleague relationship.

464
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,680
There must be a relationship line between them.

465
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Let's have a conversation and contact, okay?

466
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Okay.

467
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Tao Shou Yuan.

468
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
You...

469
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
As expected,

470
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
the Ming Dynasty has become a history.

471
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
The Ming Dynasty

472
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,680
It's been 500 years since I left the dynasty.

473
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
500 years?

474
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Why did I come 500 years later?

475
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Why did the world become like this?

476
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
I have to figure it out first.

477
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Ming Dynasty

478
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
You have to clean up and dress up yourself.

479
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
How to put on a little makeup

480
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
and put on a little dress

481
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
At least let him notice you, right?

482
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Why does it feel a little ordinary?

483
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
What? You can't find the clothes to wear tomorrow?

484
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Mom, you have a poison tree.

485
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Can you lend me some clothes?

486
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
No.

487
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Naughty.

488
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Let's go. I'll show you the clothes.

489
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Go.

490
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Hello.

491
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
I am Nanxing.

492
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
I am here for an interview.

493
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
The Ming Dynasty

494
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Come on!

495
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
You can do it.

496
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Nanxing

497
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,720
You graduated from the Department of Sports

498
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,160
You never studied

499
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,280
the subject of publishing

500
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,160
No

501
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,080
Have you ever participated in any work?

502
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,440
I worked part-time in college

503
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,680
You want to be an assistant

504
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,760
and a CEO

505
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,800
Can you tell me

506
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,440
the reason why you applied for this position?

507
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,040
Because I am a reader

508
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
of Mr. Lu for many years

509
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,840
I like his books very much

510
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,560
So I hope to stay with him

511
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
to work and study

512
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
Don't be nervous

513
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Sit down

514
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,920
What do you think your advantage is?

515
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,320
I think

516
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,960
to be an assistant for a CEO

517
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,560
the most important thing is

518
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,720
to be bold and careful

519
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
I am very bold

520
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,160
I have been

521
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,800
bolder than other boys

522
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,640
Many boys...

523
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,280
What should we do?

524
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,000
You can continue

525
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,040
Pretend I don't exist

526
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,320
Mr. Lu

527
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,840
Why does he appear?

528
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,960
Besides being bold and careful

529
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,320
what do you think your advantage is?

530
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,480
I am an athlete

531
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,280
The athlete's teeth teach me

532
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,920
to never give up

533
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,040
and never give up

534
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,120
You are an athlete

535
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,920
Never give up

536
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,560
So why did you

537
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,120
give up your athlete's teeth?

538
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,560
I...

539
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,080
Say something, Nan Xing

540
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,600
Why are you so nervous?

541
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,600
Say something

542
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,760
I...

543
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,040
Mr. Ye, why are you here?

544
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
I am looking for him

545
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,640
Why are you here?

546
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,280
I just want to have a look

547
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,120
You can continue

548
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Nan Xing

549
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,520
I am also curious

550
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
why you gave up

551
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,760
your athlete's teeth

552
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,840
I am just an assistant

553
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,560
You are the CEO of a company

554
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,400
and you are still looking for a girl

555
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,840
What? You finished the draft?

556
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,600
So idle?

557
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,640
You don't want a new assistant?

558
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,400
You know

559
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,480
I don't like strangers

560
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,680
to be idle in front of me

561
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,200
What should I do?

562
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,200
Let me come back and keep an eye on you

563
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,600
I will be a nanny for 24 hours

564
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,040
It's good to be like this before

565
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,120
It's different now

566
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,720
I have the salary

567
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,160
of a CEO

568
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,040
Okay, let's not talk about this

569
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,800
I will make the decision

570
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,720
Where are you going?

571
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,280
I will go back and write the draft

572
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,080
Finish the draft first

573
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,240
We have to go back

574
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,680
We have discussed it

575
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
Right?

576
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
As long as you are sure

577
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
you won't make any mistakes

578
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
If it's your decision

579
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,400
should I be the CEO?

580
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,840
If you really want to be the CEO

581
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,040
I am so grateful

582
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
I will be at home

583
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,800
and write my draft

584
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,600
Remember to come to the meeting tomorrow

585
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,480
Chu

586
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
The meeting time is

587
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,200
changed to 2 o'clock at 1 o'clock in the afternoon

588
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,040
Sister Jiao

589
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,880
Do you want to

590
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,800
coordinate the time?

591
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,800
Of course

592
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,480
Hello, boss

593
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,360
Boss, I...

594
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,120
Send it to me later

595
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,040
It's signed

596
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,480
This one

597
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:01,960
Okay

598
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,320
Take a look

599
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,480
It's signed

600
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,760
Just wait for this

601
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,440
Thank you, boss Ye

602
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,240
By the way, boss Ye

603
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,840
The sales of these areas

604
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,960
are much better than expected

605
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,840
Currently, the main channels

606
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,280
and the second channels

607
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,200
are all being pushed to the bottom

608
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I hope they can be replenished soon

609
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,880
Okay, I will make the decision

610
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,560
Okay, go back to your work

611
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,080
Okay

612
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
This one is signed

613
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,360
And this one

614
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,040
is for the owner of the business

615
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,680
Okay, no problem

616
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,200
Go

617
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,880
Bye

618
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,440
Why can't I say anything?

619
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,080
Am I stupid?

620
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Why can't I say anything?

621
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Why can't I say anything?

622
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,280
For 500 years

623
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,880
all the knowledge accumulated by humans

624
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,080
can't explain

625
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,560
why I appeared here

626
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,520

627
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,280
Because I want to have more
