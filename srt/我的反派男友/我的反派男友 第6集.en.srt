[Mr. Bad]

3
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,390
What do you want again?

5
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,160
I promise you.

6
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,770
What promise?

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
You like me, don't you?

8
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,160
I agree to date you.

9
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,450
Why not just tell me

10
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,539
that you like me?

11
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,770
If so, I wouldn't have to consider

12
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,770
about Lu Zichen.

13
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,870
I've thought about it.

14
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,640
Let's

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,290
nominally date each other.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,500
Then, I'll abandon

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,730
you relentlessly.

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,970
So that

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,410
you could have

20
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,000
an unforgettable love.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,570
Then, you'll be free.

22
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,120
But I don't like you.

23
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,240
How is it possible?

24
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,410
I don't like you.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,930
How could you possibly not like me?

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,640
I really don't like you.

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,450
Then, you...

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,960
Wait.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,370
Are you confessing your love to me?

30
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,600
No.

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,010
How could I possibly

32
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,870
confess to you?

33
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,050
You were confessing your love to me.

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,640
Wait.

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,620
Do it again.

36
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,750
I'll record it.

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,130
No one

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
has ever confessed to me

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,760
in my life.

40
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,450
Also, I've never

41
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,400
rejected someone before.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,040
Say it again.

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,570
Get out.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,570
What did you say?

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,160
Say it again.

46
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,820
How could she possibly not like me?

47
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,410
It's impossible.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
It's really not me.

49
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,600
How is it possible?

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,740
[Impossible.]

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,920
[I've got to confirm it.]

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,400
Xiao Wudi.

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,210
Xiao Wudi.

54
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,760
She's so happy

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,160
while dreaming of me.

56
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,270
Yet, she's still pretending.

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,540
Let's see how I'm going
to call your bluff tomorrow.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,320
Xiao Wudi.

59
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,090
Xiao Wudi.

60
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,130
Take your dirty money

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,320
and go back to the ancient times.

62
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,410
What is my senior like

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,780
when she falls in love?

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,360
When she sees a handsome guy,

65
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
she'll drool all over him

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,330
and pay lip service.

67
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,690
But in fact,

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,159
she won't make a move.

69
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,030
Sometimes,

70
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,560
she doesn't even dare to talk.

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Sometimes, she is

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,700
prone to violence.

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,810
But if you ask her

74
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,159
if she wants to be with him,

75
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,420
she will deny it again.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,280
So I think

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,250
she has never

78
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,220
fallen in love for all these years.

79
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,430
Anyway, I haven't seen it before.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,330
Then, what you said is

81
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,650
of no use to me either.

82
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,840
I haven't finished.

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,170
I haven't finished yet.

84
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,090
I haven't seen it before.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,420
But there was one time when she told me

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,650
what she was like when she fell in love.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
What was she like?

88
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,090
She will totally attach herself.

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,410
Attach herself?

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,650
She will totally attach

91
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,380
herself to the guy's emotions.

92
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,720
She'll be happy if he's happy.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
When he's upset,

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,930
she'll be more upset than he is.

95
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
If he cries in front of her,

96
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,560
she'll cry her heart out.

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Attach herself?

98
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,050
Do not think too much.

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,960
I heard

100
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,000
that she has liked

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
the guy for several years.

102
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,640
But in the end,

103
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,970
they weren't together.

104
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,010
Don't affect your relationship

105
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,740
with her because of what I said.

106
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,840
Don't worry.

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
I've got an idea.

108
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,360
Thank you.

109
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,640
Hey.

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Is he going to confess to her?

111
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,600
Should I remind Nan Xing, then?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,610
This is a good chance.

113
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,330
I have to turn on the camera first

114
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,530
to keep the evidence.

115
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,320
Forget it.

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,290
I guess she'll be nervous if I tell her.

117
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,570
Mum.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
You're back.

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,000
You're still practising?

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,130
You're done already?

121
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,770
Yes.

122
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,530
I haven't cooked yet.

123
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,440
What did you eat?

124
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,590
[Lu Zichen, give me back
my Goddess, Su Yu]

125
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,080
No.

126
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,000
It's my boss.

127
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,080
What happens to your boss?

128
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,520
He killed Su Yu.

129
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,290
Is he under arrest?

130
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
No.

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,810
Su Yu is the female lead in his novel.

132
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,200
He wrote that she's dead.

133
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,840
Now that his fans

134
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
on Weibo have exploded with anger.

135
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
It has become
the 12th most searched topic.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,730
Let me see it.

137
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,409
Lu Zichen,

138
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,600
I was your fan
but now I've become a hater.

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Lu Zichen, give me back my Goddess Su Yu.

140
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,200
Lu Zichen will have bad luck for his life.

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,840
Go die, Lu Zichen.

142
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,730
This is so brutal.

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,610
Hello, Jiaming.

144
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,560
Sorry.

145
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,850
I've got an urgent work

146
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,130
to take care of now.

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,720
I might

148
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,380
not be able to show up today.

149
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,130
[It's alright.]

150
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,010
[I can come and accompany you.]

151
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,890
It's not necessary.

152
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,550
It'll distract me if you come.

153
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,140
And I can't accompany you.

154
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,090
How about this?

155
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,350
I'll call you tonight,

156
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,920
okay?

157
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
[Alright, go on with your work.]

158
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,240
Sure.

159
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,120
[Bye bye.]

160
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,170
I've thought

161
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,560
about the way of rescuing her.

162
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,720
But there's a crucial issue.

163
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,200
I think we need

164
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,330
to discuss about it.

165
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,920
So I think tonight...

166
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,980
I've got an appointment tonight.

167
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,650
Hello, Nan Xing.

168
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,750
Go to Mr. Lu's house

169
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,450
and get his completed draft over.

170
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,980
It used to be me who did this.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,680
But I think

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,320
I should leave it to you now.

173
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,920
[Don't tell me]

174
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
[he's mad about this.]

175
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,770
Miss Ye.

176
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,600
We've searched everywhere.

177
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,080
But he's nowhere to be found.

178
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,960
He doesn't answer the phone
and reply the messages.

179
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,610
No one answered the door
when we rang his doorbell.

180
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,560
Also,

181
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,290
the proofreaders and the publishers

182
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,930
told me

183
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,010
that Boss specially ordered them

184
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,970
not to show it to the others

185
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,960
before this article was published.

186
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,090
Who else could it be?

187
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
He meant me.

188
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,490
Get back to work, go.

189
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,000
Sorry.

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,929
I still want to come and see you.

191
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,679
Coffee.

192
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,760
Thank you.

193
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,130
But

194
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,650
I might not have time for you now.

195
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,450
It's alright.

196
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,169
Hello, yes, how is it?

197
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,690
Okay.

198
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,970
Miss Jiao.

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,050
[Hello, Nan Xing.]

200
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,330
What's your situation?

201
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,520
Do you need my help?

202
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,920
[Never mind.]

203
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,840
[You can't]

204
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
[handle this kind of thing.]

205
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,160
You're right.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,490
It looks like I'll only cause
more troubles if I go there.

207
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,000
[Nan Xing, I'll get back to work.]

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,850
Okay, see you tomorrow.

209
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,480
[Bye bye.]

210
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,680
Why did you kill off Su Yu

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,520
in the novel?

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,330
Isn't she your cup of tea?

213
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,120
Will you hope

214
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,850
to see your beloved one die?

215
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,130
Or you want to ruin her
because you can't have her?

216
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,870
[Xiao Wudi]

217
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,450
[Come over now.]

218
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,440
[Have a drink with me.]

219
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,120
What's wrong with him?

220
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,200
Come in.

221
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,810
The door is open.

222
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,310
What's the matter?

223
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,920
Why do you start drinking
in broad daylight?

224
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,040
What has happened?

225
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,010
Nothing.

226
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,570
Then, why did you ask me over?

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,530
For real.

228
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,080
Just say it.

229
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,800
I just

230
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,230
don't want to be alone.

231
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,880
Why?

232
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,880
Maybe it's because

233
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,920
I was watching TV.

234
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,200
Then,

235
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,460
I suddenly thought of Hehuan Palace.

236
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,570
My hometown, Hehuan Palace.

237
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,760
[I know.]

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
[I wrote it.]

239
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,210
You used to live in the imperial palace?

240
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,090
Then, were you an emperor or an eunuch?

241
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,250
It wasn't an imperial palace.

242
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,120
Hehuan Palace was

243
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
a renowned

244
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,500
martial arts sect.

245
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,080
Because I've lost

246
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,280
my parents since I was little.

247
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,850
So my master

248
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
kept me.

249
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,920
Then, I've stayed

250
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,130
in Hehuan Palace

251
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,530
with him since I was a kid.

252
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,640
[He got a master?]

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
[Why didn't I know that?]

254
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,850
But then,

255
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,530
my master

256
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
left too.

257
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,360
He was

258
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
my only kin.

259
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,130
When he left,

260
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,330
he told me

261
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,760
to wait for a person

262
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
in the palace.

263
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,920
To wait

264
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,580
for a person
who I have to protect for my life.

265
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,050
After that,

266
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,810
I had been waiting in the palace.

267
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,200
Day by day,

268
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,360
year by year,

269
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,770
but at last,

270
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,720
I still didn't wait

271
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,920
for that person.

272
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,440
As for my master,

273
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,000
I didn't hear from him as well.

274
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,210
But I think it's great.

275
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,290
Really.

276
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,120
At least,

277
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,760
I had a home at that time.

278
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,900
What happened then?

279
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,090
Then,

280
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,250
I came here.

281
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,570
I lost everything.

282
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,050
[You believe it, right?]

283
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,860
[You're sad, aren't you?]

284
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,010
[You feel me, right?]

285
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,900
[It's time for you to admit
that you're in love with me.]

286
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,650
I... I'm fine.

287
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,280
Sorry.

288
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,770
I suddenly miss my home.

289
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,290
Never mind.

290
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,530
What an odd coincidence.

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,330
I'm feeling sad as well.

292
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,430
I'll have a drink with you.

293
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,520
Wait a moment.

294
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,360
Well,

295
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,190
why don't you make it clear first?

296
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,650
Why do you feel sad?

297
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,280
Is it because of me?

298
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,080
Actually, I don't...

299
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,730
It's all because of my boss.

300
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,000
He wrote that Su Yu is dead.

301
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
That is the renowned Su Yu.

302
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,020
The Su Yu that I've loved for ten years.

303
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
Yet, he killed off her in the novel.

304
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,720
Su Yu?

305
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,960
No.

306
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,050
After everything I've said,

307
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,410
you're sad because of Su Yu?

308
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,490
You have no idea

309
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,200
how important Su Yu is to me.

310
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,600
I grew up together

311
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,680
with Su Yu

312
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
throughout my adolescence.

313
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,280
I can say that I only have

314
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,000
few friends in high school and university.

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,800
Every time when I had a hard time,

316
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,300
Su Yu was the only one
who could accompany me.

317
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
Everyone, calm down.

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,730
Calm down, okay?

319
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,840
Calm down, will you?

320
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,640
Excuse me.

321
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,610
Sorry.

322
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,490
Excuse me.

323
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,900
Stand back! Stand back!

324
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,960
Step back!

325
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,440
Nan Xing.

326
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,040
Step back.

327
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,320
Nan Xing, over here.

328
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Be quiet.

329
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,620
This is Boss's parcel.

330
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,880
Take it to his office.

331
00:14:59,490 --> 00:14:59,820
Okay.

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,640
We're dealing with it.

333
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,010
We'll post it on our official

334
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,680
platform.

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,180
Give my goddess back to me!

336
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,040
Guys,

337
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,850
just go back and wait.

338
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay?

339
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,010
Boss.

340
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,220
They're well matched.

341
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,730
You killed off the female lead
in the novel like this.

342
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,440
How are we going to calm the readers down?

343
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,080
Look how messy

344
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,600
the situation is out there.

345
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,770
This is supposed to be

346
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,720
a heartbreaking matter.

347
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,450
Isn't it normal

348
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,490
for them to feel sorrow?

349
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,570
This is a huge matter.

350
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,570
Why can't you tell me in advance

351
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,960
and let me get prepared for this?

352
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,090
I only knew it when I saw it

353
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,130
on the most searched topic on Weibo.

354
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,660
Creation

355
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,560
is a private matter.

356
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,530
Did I even have

357
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,790
to tell you in advance?

358
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,810
Why didn't you tell me

359
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,610
before you have a relationship?

360
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,480
So this is the reason.

361
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,850
Is there any stipulation
in my labour contract

362
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,780
against me having a relationship?

363
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,970
Well,

364
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,610
it has gotten in the way of your work.

365
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,660
Think about it.

366
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,080
If it were you who came

367
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,050
to take the drafts,

368
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,680
we could've communicated with each other
face-to-face.

369
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,210
It's a completely different thing.

370
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:21,760
This is

371
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,130
Nan Xing's job.

372
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,810
I refused to be your assistant

373
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,740
not because I'm in a relationship.

374
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:28,970
Forget it.

375
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,120
Anyway, the drafts

376
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,960
have been published.

377
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,730
It has mobilised public opinion.

378
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,960
Listen to the voice out there.

379
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,160
Figure out what to do.

380
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,050
I can make the character
come back to life.

381
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,160
I'm the writer.

382
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,280
What is this for?

383
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,849
Wait.

384
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,420
What are you doing here?

385
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,680
I...

386
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,530
Your parcel.

387
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,690
You may go.

388
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,360
Okay.

389
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,290
What's wrong, Boss?

390
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,690
White...

391
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,670
[This scene is made by props]

392
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,290
Just like what you wrote...

393
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,090
Throw it away.

394
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,930
Don't tell anyone about it.

395
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,250
But...

396
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,130
Take it away.

397
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,000
Go now.

398
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,060
Nan Xing, good morning.

399
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,490
It's alright.

400
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,480
Do your work.

401
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,400
Boss.

402
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:39,960
Boss.

403
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,250
I don't think this is right.

404
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,290
You shouldn't

405
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,770
handle this in secret.

406
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,780
You should call the police.

407
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,040
Do you know

408
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
how often a mystery writer

409
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,530
will receive such threats

410
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,370
in a day?

411
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,770
You go and search

412
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,850
my name on Weibo now.

413
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,040
There are thousands of people

414
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,770
cursing me.

415
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,630
Do you think

416
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,380
the police can catch them all?

417
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,640
But,

418
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,360
he's different

419
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,240
from those trolls.

420
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,770
Obviously, he's imitating

421
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,630
the murder plot of your novel.

422
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,490
Moreover, he has

423
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,220
found out where our company is.

424
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,400
Maybe

425
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,880
he's been stalking you.

426
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,810
Do you realise the strain

427
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,610
our company is under

428
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,090
because of the network public opinion?

429
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,770
What if

430
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,900
nothing is found

431
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,080
after surrendering the case

432
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,880
to the police?

433
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,970
I already said

434
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,610
that nothing has happened

435
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,940
and it'll never happen.

436
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,570
So we just let it be?

437
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,530
What else can we do?

438
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,730
They just want to make

439
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,480
their feelings known.

440
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,120
They won't do

441
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,960
anything else.

442
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,840
But what if...

443
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,050
What if something

444
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,180
really happens?

445
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,290
No,

446
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,840
I think we need to call the police.

447
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,290
I said it's not necessary.

448
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,040
They won't do

449
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,130
anything else.

450
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,610
I can't just watch

451
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,690
you being in jeopardy

452
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,930
and do nothing.

453
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,960
No, I must capture him.

454
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,200
How?

455
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Can you catch him?

456
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,600
Are you trying to show me your ability

457
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,170
because you want

458
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,410
to become a regular staff?

459
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,890
That's not my intention.

460
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,370
I do this to keep you safe.

461
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,800
I'm totally safe.

462
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
No, I must capture him.

463
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,250
Just get over it already.

464
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,890
You...

465
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,490
Boss,

466
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,700
is it because

467
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,650
you think I want you
to make me a regular staff

468
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,360
and you won't?

469
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,570
That's why you won't let me capture him?

470
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,560
I won't?

471
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,850
Fine, if you catch him,

472
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,750
I'll make you a regular staff.

473
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,280
Okay, it's a deal.

474
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
[What am I doing?]

475
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,040
Nan Xing.

476
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,810
What's wrong?

477
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,210
Are you not feeling well?

478
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,500
Do you have a fever?

479
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,290
Why are you blushing?

480
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,200
I'm fine.

481
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,210
Miss Jiao,

482
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,600
I...

483
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,970
Can I

484
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,120
use the toilet?

485
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,240
Why do you ask for my permission?

486
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,690
Just go ahead.

487
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,960
Thank you.

488
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,880
Thank you?

489
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,650
I'm screwed.

490
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,420
I can't believe I talked back to Boss.

491
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,880
What should I do?

492
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,300
How could I do something like this?

493
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,040
No.

494
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,120
What matters now is

495
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,970
to find out the criminal.

496
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes, find the criminal.

497
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,100
White pigeon killings,

498
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
[according to the plot,]

499
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,300
[the criminal will
come here again tonight.]

500
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,320
[And he will stick
the bloodstained feathers]

501
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,000
[on the victim's door.]

502
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,400
[On the third day,]

503
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,330
[the victim's body will be found.]

504
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,770
No.

505
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,010
I must stop this from happening.

506
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,850
What to do? What to do?

507
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,210
[Actually, what I want to tell you is]

508
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,960
[that you're not alone.]

509
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,080
[I'm here with you.]

510

[I'm your armour.]

511
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,130
Hello.

512
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,860
Hello, Young Master Xiao.

513
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:13,960
What do you want?

514
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,720
[Can you]

515
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,080
[come to our company?]

516
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
[I need your help.]

517

I'm not free.

You...

519
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,880
Xiao Wudi,

520
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,560
I need you now.

521
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,880
Help, come and help me.

522
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,320
[Help, come and help me.]

523
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,010
You're really here.

524
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,170
Can you choose a better place?

525
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,120
I didn't expect it would be so accurate.

526
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,890
Nan Xing.

527
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:55,890
Nan Xing.

528
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,570
Nan Xing, are you in there?

529
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,340
Nan Xing, are you in there?

530
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,560
Miss Jiao, what's the matter?

531
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,640
Nothing.

532
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,360
As you've been here

533
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,150
for so long,

534
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,860
I'm worried

535
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,280
if you're not feeling well.

536
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,610
Are... Are you alright?

537
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,680
I've got diarrhoea.

538
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,050
You... You've got diarrhoea?

539
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,000
Is it serious?

540
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm fine, Miss Jiao.

541
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,580
I'll be fine in a minute.

542
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Alright, then.

543
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,650
I'll head back first.

544
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,450
Text me if there's anything.

545
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,040
Sure.

546
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,010
Put me down.

547
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,060
My legs are numb.

548
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,760
I do need your help.

549
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,770
Can we get out of here first?

550
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,240
So

551
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,740
I conclude that he will

552
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,140
show up again tonight.

553
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,600
As long as we lie in wait,

554
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm sure we can catch him.

555
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,620
Okay, okay.

556
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,140
I know what you want to say.

557
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,410
You're going to say,

558
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,010
"Know your place."

559
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,680
"You're a hostage and I'm an abductor."

560
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,120
"Believe it or not, I'll get you..."

561
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Alright.

562
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,320
I'll help you.

563
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,810
Are you sure?

564
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,620
I'll find a place to wait for you

565
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,480
to get off.

566
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,980
Well, I'll buy you a meal today.

567
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,080
Buy me a meal?

568
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,600
Do you have money?

569
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,320
Then, I'll find you a fine restaurant.

570
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,650
It'll be your treat.

571
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,350
You can't sit here. Get up.

572
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,840
Get down.

573
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,560
Your head.

574
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,370
Can you stop it?

575
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,650
Can you keep it down?

576
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
What if he shows up

577
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,530
now?

578
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,290
Why would a bad guy

579
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,520
come here after doing

580
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,210
bad deeds?

581
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,620
To wait to be arrested?

582
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,080
There's no logic.

583
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,740
What does logic matter to a die-hard fan?

584
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,010
According to the plot of the story,

585
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,050
he should be here

586
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,010
to stick the bloodstained feathers.

587
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,410
So I'm sure he'll show up.

588
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,340
Why do you...

589
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,890
I told you not to stand up.

590
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
You're so jumpy.

591
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,010
Hello, mum.

592
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,360
[Nan Xing, where are you?]

593
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,420
I forgot to tell you

594
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,280
that I have to work overtime today.

595
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,140
Go to bed first, don't wait for me.

596
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,370
[Are you]

597
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,410
[with Xiong now?]

598
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm not with Xiong.

599
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,480
[Got it.]

600
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,320
[Don't be too late.]

601
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,520
Okay, I know. Bye bye.

602
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,250
Do you like this job that much?

603
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,350
Can't you get another job?

604
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:55,720
I told you

605
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,730
I didn't do this
to become a regular staff.

606
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,480
Even you think it that way.

607
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Okay.

608
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,420
Even if that's not your intention,

609
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,330
this is just a job.

610
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,990
Is it necessary to do this?

611
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,860
Because this job is

612
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,810
very important to me.

613
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,440
Do you

614
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,120
remember

615
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,650
that I've told you

616
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,450
about the huge matter that happened

617
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,200
in my family

618
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
when I was in high school?

619
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,680
Actually, during that time,

620
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,010
I was so depressed.

621
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,250
I thought

622
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,330
that I couldn't take it any longer.

623
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,000
It was my boss's novel

624
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,130
that rescued me.

625
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,730
Didn't he write mystery novels?

626
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,080
It can rescue someone?

627
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,010
Because he did great in writing it.

628
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,130
So I read

629
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,330
all of his novels.

630
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,940
I didn't have the time to imagine things.

631
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,560
Slowly,

632
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,760
I went through

633
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,240
those hard times.

634
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,840
So I'm sincerely thankful for him.

635
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,940
He's not only good at writing novels,

636
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,730
he's also

637
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,730
a person who has great ambition.

638
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,680
He's a successful man

639
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,840
and he wants to help

640
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,600
those writers who have dreams.

641
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,640
He's done many things

642
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,120
that he should do

643
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,240
but they are unprofitable.

644
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,490
So I thought to myself

645
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,720
that whether I'll become a retired athlete

646
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,890
or change my career,

647
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,440
I also want

648
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,170
to become a person like him.

649
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,730
I'm fine even if
it's only working for him.

650
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,850
Being able to work for him is

651
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,530
something worth dying for.

652
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,920
What kind of a job will take your life?

653
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,040
Isn't today's matter

654
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,000
dangerous?

655
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,230
Think about it.

656
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,650
What if the criminal brings weapon

657
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,180
with him?

658
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,650
Or else, why would I ask you over?

659
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,810
Just go and ask him

660
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,620
if he has brought any weapons.

661
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,250
Don't go!

662
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,800
Xiao Wudi.

663
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,520
Xiao Wudi.

664
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,520
Xiao Wudi.

665
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,380
What's wrong with you?

666
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,010
Xiao Wudi.

667
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,920
Xiao Wudi, you...

668
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,170
I can't believe he brought a dagger.

669
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,720
Stop talking.

670
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,020
I'll call an ambulance now.

671
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,930
No need, Nan Xing.

672
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,160
It's too late.

673
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,000
It's not too late.

674
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
It's not too late.

675
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,380
We have advanced

676
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,440
medical technology here.

677
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,040
Then, I...

678
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,210
I'll give you

679
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,400
all my blood.

680
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,170
You... Just don't fall asleep.

681
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,290
Nan Xing,

682
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,260
I might not be able
to accompany you in the future.

683
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,200
Xiao Wudi, you...

684
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,040
Wake up! Xiao Wudi!

685
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm sorry.

686
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,170
Sorry, I...

687
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,410
Xiao Wudi!

688
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,290
You're alright?

689
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,370
I was just joking.

690
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,440
Why do you cry like this?

691
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:00,960
Are you nuts?

692
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
How could you make this kind of joke?

693
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,960
Are you out of your mind?

694
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,120
Stay away from me!

695
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,800
Stop crying.

696
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,800
Look.

697
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,080
I'm not dead, am I?

698
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,570
Are you mad because I'm not dead?

699
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,240
Yes, indeed.

700
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,010
Indeed, I deserve to die.

701
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,560
If I die,

702
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,400
no one will

703
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,060
bully you like this again.

704
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,120
That's right.

705
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,400
If hitting me can cool you down,

706
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,880
just hit me more.

707
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,560
You should be happy now.

708
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,460
Think about it.

709
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
You've caught that man in black.

710
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Then, you'll be able to
become a regular staff.

711
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,240
Now, you should think

712
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,290
about how you're going to thank me.

713
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,680
I

714
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,250
can grudgingly accept your appreciation.

715
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,200
I can also thank you.

716
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:43,930
Thank you.

717
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,040
Don't be mad.

718
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,080
I was just

719
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,690
joking.

720
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,969
How could you make this kind of joke?

721
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,070
Have you thought about those
who care about you?

722
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,210
I will never

723
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,080
make this kind of joke again.

724
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,930
When did this happen?

725
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,290
Why didn't you call the police

726
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,420
and tell me about it?

727
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,120
This is ridiculous.

728
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,320
You're not kids anymore.

729
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,090
Why can't you

730
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,640
have sense of propriety?

731
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,000
What if something really happens?

732
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,040
How are you going to explain
to her family?

733
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,370
I was just spitballing.

734
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,810
Who knew she'd take it seriously?

735
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,650
You're her boss.

736
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,250
Of course she has to
take your words seriously.

737
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,520
And you,

738
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,000
how could you take
everything he said seriously?

739
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,660
I didn't think much that time.

740
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,570
All I thought

741
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,580
was how to solve

742
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,560
this matter.

743
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,840
Don't worry.

744
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,410
If anything happens,

745
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,130
I won't get the company

746
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,410
and you involved.

747
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,920
Nan Xing,

748
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,240
you're here to work.

749
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,400
You get paid for your effort.

750
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,200
You can resign

751
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,790
if you don't want this job.

752
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,330
I want you to work hard.

753
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,040
But bear this in mind.

754
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,160
You're not here to risk your life.

755
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,590
Moreover, you brought your neighbour over.

756
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,390
What if anything happens to him?

757
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,770
Xiao Wudi.

758
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,420
Xiao Wudi, wake up.

759
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,170
Xiao Wudi.

760
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,920
Xiao Wudi, wake up.

761
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,660
I'm sorry, Miss Ye.

762
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,880
I know I've done wrong.

763
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
You don't have to apologise.

764
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,320
Go and apologise

765
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,080
to him later.

766
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
Miss Ye, Boss,

767
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm already satisfied
with being able to work

768
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,210
in the company for days.

769
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,970
Thank you, I mean it.

770
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,570
Where are you going?

771
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm going to pack my things up.

772
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,450
I'll come and bid farewell

773
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,110
to everyone if I have a chance.

774
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,190
What bid farewell?

775
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,520
You've become a regular staff.

776
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,250
Why do you mean by bid farewell?

777
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,860
A regular staff?

778
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,450
Yes.

779
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,130
Didn't he say

780
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,970
that he'll keep you
if you catch the criminal?

781
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,520
I'll fulfil the promise on his behalf.

782
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,330
No, Miss Ye.

783
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,680
I didn't do this
to become a regular staff.

784
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,120
Boss was just spitballing.

785
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,440
I was just spitballing.

786
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,700
It's not your turn yet.

787
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
I call the shots.

788
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:10,930
You may leave.

789
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,690
Nan Xing.

790
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,440
Leave.

791
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,190
Why did you keep it from me?

792
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,090
A death threat is not a small matter.

793
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,000
I thought

794
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,010
it was

795
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,800
just a small security issue.

796
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,970
I didn't need you to get involved in it.

797
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,480
Besides, you're so busy.

798
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,490
And

799
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,800
you've got a boyfriend.

800
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,370
Lu Zichen,

801
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,970
can you stop being so wilful?

802
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,790
You didn't tell me
that you killed off Su Yu in the book.

803
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,590
And you didn't tell me

804
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,450
that you received a death threat.

805
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,470
I knew that you only like to write.

806
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,810
To write what you like.

807
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,890
To do your favourite things.

808
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,320
You said that you don't like
to manage the company.

809
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,690
Okay, I'll do my best

810
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,080
to manage the company.

811
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,810
We build

812
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,210
this company together.

813
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,130
I support your dream of writing books.

814
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,840
I want to let

815
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,800
more people know about your work.

816
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,330
This is also my dream.

817
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,960
Can you please

818
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,850
understand me?

819
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,370
Can you

820
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,970
stop being so wilful?

821
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,240
Mr. Xiao, right?

822
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,320
Sorry to trouble you.

823
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,980
Never mind.

824
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,240
Call a cab and take Mr. Xiao home

825
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,170
to get some rest.

826
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,330
Let's go.

827
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,970
Why did you break into our company?

828
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,720
I just wanted to vent my anger.

829
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,780
It was just a prank.

830
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,130
I just wanted him

831
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,750
to bring Su Yu back to life.

832
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,630
I never thought

833
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,510
of hurting him.

834
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,580
If you really

835
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,680
like Su Yu,

836
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,740
you should respect and believe

837
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,460
in the person who creates her.

838
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,680
Without him,

839
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,780
the Su Yu we love would never exist.

840
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,480
I've called the police.

841
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,740
Please understand it.

842
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,910
Your love for her is

843
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,410
not an excuse to do this.

844
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,520
Xiao Wudi.

845
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,680
Well.

846
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,270
You don't have to thank me.

847
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,400
You ran into the hater today

848
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,490
because of your own judgement.

849
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,580
So there's no need to thank me.

850
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,530
I'm not trying to thank you.

851
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,610
But

852
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,050
indeed, I have to apologise to you.

853
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,250
I was mad

854
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,930
that you lied to me just now.

855
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,050
But Miss Ye was right.

856
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,490
I shouldn't have asked you over
to take this risk.

857
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,600
I was wrong, sorry.

858
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,320
It's alright.

859
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,290
Anyway, I've lied to you.

860
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,920
Let's call it even.

861
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,570
What matters now is

862
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,720
that you've become a regular staff.

863
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,840
Don't think too much.

864
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,440
It was Miss Ye

865
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,810
who insisted to convert me
to a regular staff.

866
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,490
Our boss

867
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,170
didn't seem to be happy.

868
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,320
It looks like Ye Qing, Miss Ye

869
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,400
and Lu Zichen

870
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,700
have an extraordinary relationship.

871
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,880
You've thought too much.

872
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Miss Ye already has a boyfriend.

873
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,530
How did you know that?

874
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,810
I overheard it.

875
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,650
Overheard?

876
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,040
I didn't mean to do that.

877
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,650
It was a coincidence.

878
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,370
Besides, it looked like

879
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,690
our boss wasn't happy

880
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,820
about Miss Ye having a boyfriend.

881
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,810
Actually, I feel a bit guilty
about being converted

882
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,250
to a regular staff.

883
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,680
I don't know

884
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,170
if the colleagues will think

885
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,640
that I've used improper means
to get the post.

886
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,720
As long as you hold the job.

887
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,160
Why do you care
what the others will think?

888
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,280
Anyway, just solve

889
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,480
all the problems

890
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,130
you encounter tomorrow.

891
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,690
Don't waste my effort

892
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,770
doing this

893
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,050
with you all night.

894
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,080
Okay, I understand.
