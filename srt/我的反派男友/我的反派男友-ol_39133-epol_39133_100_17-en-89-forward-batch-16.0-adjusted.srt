[Mr. Bad]

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,190
[Episode 17]

4
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,620
Mr. Lu,

5
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,780
I thought you weren't here...

6
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,620
I'm here to deliver

7
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,060
this week's schedule to you.

8
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,420
Those meetings that require

9
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,860
your attendance are remarked.

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,660
Leave it here.

11
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,060
Have you not

12
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,980
gone home

13
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,690
since the PEN congress?

14
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,350
Is there a meeting for
me and Miss Ye today?

15
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,560
Yes, there is one at 11am.

16
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,840
Boss,

17
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,500
is there something

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,340
happened between

19
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,140
that friend of yours and Miss Ye?

20
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,620
If he's not in a good condition,

21
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
I could postpone

22
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,000
the meeting.

23
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,740
Can't you tell

24
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,240
my current condition?

25
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,130
I will attend the meeting.

26
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,650
Cancel all other work.

27
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,280
Sure.

28
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,530
I don't mind all the things
you just said.

29
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,160
But I do.

30
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
Are you that unsure of me?

31
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,700
Let's pretend nothing

32
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,250
has happened today, okay?

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,420
During the PEN congress,
we discovered that

34
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,700
most of the authors

35
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,540
very much emphasize

36
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,940
Mr. Lu's opinion.

37
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,760
Hence, we hope that

38
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,180
Mr. Lu could judge on

39
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,340
those shortlisted pieces

40
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,820
other than just

41
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,100
the Grand Prize.

42
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,060
Will you have the time

43
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,410
for it, Mr. Lu?

44
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,220
Do you mean top four
for shortlisted pieces?

45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,840
Yes.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,290
What do you think?

47
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,380
Four pieces

48
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,650
and a Grand Prize.

49
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,940
Review volume is somewhere

50
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,100
around two hundred thousand words.

51
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,829
Is that okay?

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,670
I want to know why.

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,170
We're talking about the New Star Program.

54
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,460
I want to know why

55
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,320
you think it will fail.

56
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,340
The president's office will confirm

57
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,010
Mr. Lu's schedule this week.

58
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,579
He has a

59
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,209
film revision meeting to attend.

60
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,220
After confirmation,

61
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,839
arrange that with Mr. Shi.

62
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,060
Miss Ye.

63
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,770
Hi.

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,640
Mr. Lu.

65
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,860
I know what you want to say.

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,260
But I can't pretend

67
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,960
nothing's ever happened.

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
You didn't go home last night right?

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,500
I'll order company's driver
to send you home.

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,600
I don't need it.

71
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,000
Alright then.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,120
I will take my time off.

73
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,120
I'll rest for a few days.

74
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,220
I'll be back after you
get yourself together.

75
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,820
I don't permit your time off.

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,380
If you keep on being like this today

77
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,909
in front of our colleagues,

78
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,220
how can we

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,840
continue working together?

80
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,740
That is

81
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,540
not what I want, working with you.

82
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,800
What is it then?

83
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,440
You want me to resign?

84
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm fine with that.

85
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,220
But please don't overcomplicate

86
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,440
things further.

87
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,700
Other than the Grand Prize,

88
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,420
shortlisted pieces

89
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,500
will also be reviewed by Mr. Lu.

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,420
Remember to follow up on that.

91
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,300
And this is our...

92
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,080
Miss Ye.

93
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,760
Hello, Miss Ye.

94
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,180
Summarise those projects

95
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,860
that I'm involved with from

96
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,780
president's office's side,

97
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,180
including all details and send them to me.

98
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,940
Miss Ye, you're involved with

99
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,700
all the projects here.

100
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,740
Send me all of them then.

101
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,480
Alright.

102
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,580
Mr. Shi,

103
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,730
you happen to be here.

104
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,060
Please sort out all those

105
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,460
progress details of
Physical Book Project from

106
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,940
Editorial Department and send them to me.

107
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,460
Alright.

108
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,020
I hope that could be done

109
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,100
and sent to my mailbox

110
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
before you leave work.

111
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,220
Thanks, everyone.

112
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,700
Alright.

113
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,380
Alright.

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,320
Nan Xing.

115
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,440
Come with me.

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,820
You want to see Xiao Wudi alone?

117
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,520
Yes.

118
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,020
I want to talk to him

119
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,140
about the script.

120
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,100
But his number

121
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,140
isn't on our contact list.

122
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,740
Could you schedule it for me?

123
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,240
Of course.

124
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,750
Is there anything else?

125
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,580
You can get back to your work now.

126
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,720
Sure.

127
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,420
Nan Xing,

128
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,150
what's the matter with Miss Ye?

129
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,400
Nothing.

130
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,080
Could you...

131
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
I'm searching for the material.

132
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,620
Could you search for the form

133
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,440
for me as well?

134
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,060
This is for Circulation Department right?

135
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,140
Yes, and this is for Publicity Department.

136
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,340
Yes, for Publicity Department as well.

137
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,210
Hello.

138
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,980
Hello, is this Mr. Xiao?

139
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,530
We're calling from the bank.

140
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,060
No, you had the wrong number.

141
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,720
Goodbye.

142
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,820
Don't hang up.

143
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,020
I'm just kidding.

144
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,220
Why didn't you pick up my joke?

145
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,220
You call me this late,

146
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,900
can't I complain a little?

147
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,500
[Where is the late?]

148
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,260
[It's not even lunch hour yet.]

149
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,020
[I thought,]

150
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,380
[with how much]

151
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,620
[you miss me,]

152
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,940
you could only hold for an hour.

153
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,580
I need to work.

154
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,420
It's not so good

155
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,409
to have personal phone calls
during working hours.

156
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,140
And I need to finance you,

157
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,460
a boyfriend who doesn't work.

158
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,130
I have to work even harder.

159
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,780
I'll tell you what.

160
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,040
You

161
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
don't have to work hard for too long.

162
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,000
What do you mean?

163
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,940
I have prepared you

164
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,970
a surprise.

165
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,160
What surprise?

166
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,500
If I tell now,

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,160
will that still be a surprise?

168
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,760
[Are you available tomorrow morning?]

169
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,890
Why?

170
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,210
You want to date me?

171
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,260
For a trip?

172
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,250
Sure thing.

173
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,730
[No.]

174
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,540
[It's Miss Ye.]

175
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,840
She wants to talk to you about the script.

176
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,760
Date me?

177
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,060
[Yes, and it's one on one]

178
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,400
without me.

179
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,370
I'm telling you.

180
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,300
My boss seems to be feeling

181
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,730
a little gloomy today.

182
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,690
[He seems to have
had a fight with Miss Ye.]

183
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,780
[Then, Miss Ye wants to]

184
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,900
[date you alone.]

185
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,530
I think it's kind of weird.

186
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,620
Do you think

187
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,200
I should go and ask about it?

188
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,659
You don't need to ask him.

189
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,140
You'd better not speak a word

190
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,820
[with Lu Zichen,]

191
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,940
[except for communication]

192
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,200
[regarding work.]

193
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,050
Hi, Mr. Lu.

194
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,630
I'm just kidding.

195
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,720
That's really funny.

196
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,720
Alright.

197
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,300
About meeting with Ye Qing,

198
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,690
you can help me proceed.

199
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,660
It's most probably

200
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,320
about the contract.

201
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,100
You don't have to worry.

202
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,180
We will go together tomorrow morning.

203
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,700
Okay, that's it then.

204
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,180
I'll tell her that you said okay.

205
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,500
Today,

206
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,770
I won't have the time

207
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,860
to lunch with you.

208
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm a little busy today.

209
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,160
Then, how about

210
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,260
you come fetch me tonight?

211
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,880
I want to take you to a place.

212
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,490
I'll check my schedule again.

213
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,620
It's fine without unexpected events.

214
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,570
You wait and see.

215
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,050
I'll surprise you.

216
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,800
Sure.

217
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,360
Bye bye.

218
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,520
Bye bye.

219
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,980
Surprise?

220
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,490
Xiao Wudi, you...

221
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,310
Finally, you're off from work.

222
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,330
What are you searching for?

223
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,340
My surprise.

224
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,820
Didn't you say

225
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,350
you prepared me a surprise?

226
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,010
Where is it?

227
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,920
So impatient of you.

228
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,080
Birth certificate?

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,080
Where did you get it from?

230
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,680
I photoshopped it myself.

231
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,020
You photoshopped what?

232
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,100
This is illegal.

233
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,660
Once I have this,

234
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,100
I can register an account.

235
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,740
I can register for an ID.

236
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,680
Then?

237
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,140
Then, I could

238
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,410
take the college entrance exam.

239
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,250
Try to think.

240
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,260
With my intelligence and wisdom,

241
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,580
I could effortlessly

242
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,380
get into any famous university.

243
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,010
Just give me some time.

244
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,090
Don't you fancy this company?

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,420
I'll spend another three to five years

246
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,060
to tackle into the company.

247
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,660
Lu Zichen and Ye Qing

248
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,460
would be kicked out
by my capability for sure.

249
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,300
The company

250
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,780
will be ours to rule then.

251
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,380
You can do whatever you want.

252
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,860
No, definitely no.

253
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,440
How can you think that way?

254
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,770
What are you laughing at?

255
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,620
I knew you wouldn't agree.

256
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,280
I was just kidding.

257
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,250
I would definitely not do that.

258
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,900
With my intelligence,

259
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,890
I could find a work out there.

260
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,580
Those university professor

261
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,700
positions

262
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,250
are within easy reach.

263
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,900
Or I will sacrifice a little

264
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,050
and enter the entertainment industry.

265
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,240
Don't you worry.

266
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,250
I will definitely

267
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,640
be responsible for

268
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,240
our better future.

269
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,580
Unexpectedly,

270
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,440
you've been so thoughtful for me.

271
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,290
However,

272
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,180
I must delete this one

273
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,600
because it's illegal.

274
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,280
Done, it's deleted.

275
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,840
I photoshopped whole day for it.

276
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,730
You don't need it.

277
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,320
Don't worry.

278
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,660
I'll take care of you.

279
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,660
Let's go. I'll take you to

280
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,760
a special place.

281
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,240
Look.

282
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,380
That classroom right there

283
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,300
was where I had my classes.

284
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,620
I used to

285
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,640
pass by this corridor everyday.

286
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,660
Those days, I was so envious of

287
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,660
those who could be in a relationship

288
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,800
in school.

289
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,300
There is even a love holy land

290
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,370
in our school.

291
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,010
It's a lotus pond.

292
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,200
It's over there.

293
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,980
There were many

294
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,760
little ducks in the pond.

295
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,250
There were two little ducks

296
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,740
which always stuck together everyday.

297
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,770
I even gave them

298
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,850
a name.

299
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,900
I named one as Wang,

300
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,360
another as Ba.

301
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,540
Because together

302
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,040
it means idiot.

303
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,420
Why were you that naughty?

304
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,980
I was thinking

305
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,490
that I must fall in love.

306
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,540
So I could

307
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,300
circle around the pond

308
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,570
with the one I adore

309
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,460
everyday,

310
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,280
and chit chat at the same time.

311
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,380
If we could

312
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,490
circle five rounds each day,

313
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,340
then we could circle

314
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,290
1825 rounds in a year.

315
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,960
1825?

316
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,340
How could you have so much

317
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,300
to talk about?

318
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,380
Isn't falling in love meant to

319
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,440
have limitless topics to talk about?

320
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,610
But that was just a fantasy anyway.

321
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,580
By far,

322
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,310
I did not circle even one round.

323
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,080
So let's go circle then.

324
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,720
Sure.

325
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,840
Where is pond?

326
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,320
Why is it filled in?

327
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,800
It's okay.

328
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,120
Let us

329
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,640
visit your classroom then.

330
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,850
We're almost there.

331
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,250
That's the classroom.

332
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,960
The room isn't locked.

333
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,000
Look.

334
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,700
This is the classroom

335
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
I used to have classes in.

336
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,980
So big.

337
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,180
55, 56, 57,

338
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,940
58,59.

339
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,250
This is the row.

340
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,250
59 is my student number.

341
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,180
So I used to

342
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,730
sit here everyday.

343
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,610
This is the seat?

344
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,200
Who was sitting beside you?

345
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,360
It's the

346
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,560
student number 50.

347
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
There was

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,060
a boy classmate that time

349
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,580
who was the English class representative,

350
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
he used to

351
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,660
assign English homework

352
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,980
on the blackboard everyday.

353
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,900
But he always

354
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
put a letter "U"

355
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,500
at the end of the sentence.

356
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,370
None of us understood

357
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,450
what it meant.

358
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,900
Until the graduation day,

359
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,520
we all understood.

360
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,080
What did it mean?

361
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,220
On the graduation day,

362
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,280
he confessed to the girl he liked.

363
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,260
The girl's name was

364
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,840
Lin Xinyou.

365
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,920
Did they get together?

366
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,150
They were together after the confession.

367
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,080
[Nan Xing]

368
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,700
[Nan Xing]

369
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
What do you think?

370
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,109
[Xiao Wudi, Nan Xing]

371
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
What do you think?

372
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,600
What are you guys
doing here so late at night?

373
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:04,250
[Xiao Wudi, Nan Xing]

374
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,210
Why so early?

375
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,530
You must be earlier than punctual

376
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,190
when you're meeting someone.

377
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,460
It's all because of you.

378
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,840
Are you awake yet?

379
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,240
Wake up.

380
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,290
It's still early.

381
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,580
Miss Ye shouldn't be here yet.

382
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,640
You wait here downstairs for awhile.

383
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,040
Sure.

384
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,180
You can head to work.

385
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,820
I'll walk around here myself.

386
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Then I will go up and meet her myself.

387
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,340
Remember to find me
after the meeting then.

388
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,330
Bye bye.

389
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,920
Come in.

390
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,800
Have a seat.

391
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,360
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,680
This is for someone else.

393
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,160
Mr. Xiao,

394
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,330
as you have seen at the PEN congress,

395
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,410
of all the shortlisted authors,

396
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,460
the only collaborators

397
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,840
are you and Nan Xing.

398
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,260
So I wish to know more about

399
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,010
the relationship between you both.

400
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,360
Including the sharing of work and profit.

401
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,930
Regarding this matter,

402
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,770
Nan Xing should be able to handle right?

403
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,970
Why did you make me come all the way here?

404
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,500
Because you're a smart man.

405
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,430
So I would like to be frank with you.

406
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,170
I know very well of

407
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,920
Nan Xing's creativity level.

408
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,300
A piece

409
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,220
like Mr. Bad,

410
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,380
is completely original to Nan Xing

411
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,780
both in terms of
writing style and emotion.

412
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,130
So I personally hope that

413
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,980
we could

414
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,180
add profit sharing terms

415
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,300
onto our contract

416
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,120
in the future.

417
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,940
This way we could ensure that

418
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,570
Nan Xing gets what she deserves.

419
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,540
From what you said,

420
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,500
you're worried that

421
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,130
I might take advantage of Nan Xing?

422
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,940
I reckon with Nan Xing's personality,

423
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,820
most probably

424
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,780
she wouldn't talk to you
about the money in advance.

425
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,540
So this is why I

426
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,900
need to avoid the risk in advance.

427
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,240
[She's quite considerate of Nan Xing.]

428
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,300
What if I

429
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,940
really wanted to take advantage of her

430
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,050
and refused to sign a contract with you,

431
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,510
what would you do about it?

432
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Then, I would

433
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,220
use document comparison way

434
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,600
to kick you out.

435
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,260
I have a piece here

436
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,780
written by Nan Xing

437
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,490
before she joined the company.

438
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,410
We only need to do a comparison

439
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,850
to discover that

440
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,050
your contribution isn't significant.

441
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,290
Xingchen's Love Story.

442
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,010
I asked Nan Xing before.

443
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,580
This script's main male character

444
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,170
is also based on you.

445
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,620
But you're a villain

446
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,890
in the novel.

447
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,940
[If Lu Zichen is the great man]

[Xiao Wudi.]

463
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,760
You said

464
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,010
this is written by Nan Xing
before she entered

465
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:50,840
the company?

466
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,960
Any problem with that?

467
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,780
I used to write fan fiction.

468
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,820
All of a sudden, I need to write

469
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,660
original novel.

470
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,560
I don't know what to write at all.

471
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,890
Wait.

472
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,880
You can write novel?

473
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,960
Why didn't you show it to me?

474
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,100
The novels I write
are all about romance.

475
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,480
You wouldn't like it.

476
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,900
It's very similar to

477
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,620
the first movie

478
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,120
that we watched today.

479
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,240
Mr. Xiao.

480

Xiao Wudi.

481
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,080
Xiao Wudi.

482
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,480
Xiao Wudi, what's wrong with you?

483
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,080
What did Miss Ye tell you?

484
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,410
Is it something wrong

485
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,600
with our novel?

486
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,560
Who am I actually?

487
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,440
You are Xiao Wudi.

488
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,170
Before you summoned me,

489
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,530
you already knew who I am, right?

490
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,620
So I didn't actually travel here,

491
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,360
did I?

492
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,600
Xiao Wudi,

493
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,360
listen to me.

494
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,860
I...

495
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,290
I'm only

496
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,210
a fictional character.

497
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,220
I'm a villain in the novel

498
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,850
that you wrote.

499
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,460
I'm a

500
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,080
notorious evil boss, right?

501
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,980
When you thought

502
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,540
you were someone who travelled here

503
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,490
from the ancient times,

504
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,710
I did actually think of explaining to you.

505
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,560
But I was too afraid at that moment.

506
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,860
I worried that

507
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,620
you would be the same as I wrote you.

508
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,360
So I did not say anything.

509
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,660
After that, I forgot

510
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,720
about it.

511
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,850
Then...

512
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,100
I didn't purposely

513
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,340
hide it from you or try to deceive...

514
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,160
Stop talking.

515
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,780
I'm a little messed up now.

516
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,280
Leave me alone for now.

517
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,040
Xiao Wudi, listen to me...

518
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,640
I can't look at you now.

519
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,940
[Before you summoned me,]

520
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,870
[you already knew who I am, right?]

521
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,420
I...

522
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm only

523
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,810
a fictional character.

524
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,980
I'm a villain in the novel

525
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,400
that you wrote.

526
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,060
I am a

527
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,680
notorious evil boss, right?

528
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,760
[Xiao Wudi,]

529
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,160
[I didn't mean to lie to you.]

530
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,050
[Ye Qing]

531
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,390
[Nan Xing, come see me.]

532
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,000
Come in.

533
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,680
Miss Ye, how can I help you?

534
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,570
Have a seat.

535
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,260
I know that

536
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,420
you collaborate with

537
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,300
Xiao Wudi.

538
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,700
You guys are quite close.

539
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,740
I also can tell that

540
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,730
he's a very smart person.

541
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,060
He does things in

542
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,600
an usual way.

543
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,690
But when I showed him

544
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,740
Xingchen's Love Story

545
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,320
that you wrote,

546
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,740
his reaction told me

547
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,020
that I might be

548
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,140
misunderstand the
relationship between you guys.

549
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,640
Are you both...

550
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,880
No.

551
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,260
That

552
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,780
is a trap

553
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,240
that I set for myself.

554
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,540
Am I a little interfering?

555
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,300
What can I do to...

556
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,840
You're fine, Miss Ye.

557
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,700
I

558
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,740
actually did

559
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,370
interfere you as well,

560
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,000
about you and Mr. Lu.

561
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,980
He kept asking me,

562
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,160
so I...

563
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,970
I already knew about this.

564
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,840
You knew?

565
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,880
I haven't told you any of that.

566
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,140
By observing the things he's done

567
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,900
and your reaction,

568
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,120
I've guessed it.

569
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,720
I'm sorry, Miss Ye.

570
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,300
However, Mr. Lu

571
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,850
really cares about you.

572
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,050
He's worked very hard behind the scene.

573
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,170
I know.

574
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,880
I won't blame you for this.

575
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,280
Don't worry about it.

576
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,490
By the way,

577
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,360
I actually wanted to help you

578
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,180
finalize the collaboration
between you and Xiao Wudi

579
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,490
before I resign.

580
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,220
But I didn't expect to...

581
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,260
You...

582
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,200
You said you're about to resign?

583
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,490
But...

584
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,480
If you left, how would the company...

585
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,320
How could the company run?

586
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,920
It's no problem.

587
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,680
Company will be fine no matter who leaves.

588
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
You guys are still here, aren't you?

589
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,520
By the way,

590
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,420
please keep this a secret for me,

591
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,160
okay?

592
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,400
How could I keep it a secret?

593
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,970
How could I keep...

594
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,770
I don't know how.

595
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,640
Don't cry.

596
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,480
Don't cry.

597
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,850
No more beauty if you cry.

598
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,170
You're not cute anymore if you cry.

599
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,680
You're becoming ugly.

600
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:50,740
[So]

601
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,520
[I'm only a fictional character
in the novel.]

602
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
[I don't actually exist]

603
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,800
[in this world.]

604
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,440
[How about Hehuan Palace?]

605
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,080
[How about Master?]

606
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,120
Because I

607
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,330
didn't have parents since little,

608
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,900
so my Master

609
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,720
adopted me since then.

610
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,900
I've been staying in the Hehuan Palace

611
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,380
with him since little.

612
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,690
At least at that time,

613
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,160
I considered myself in a family.

614
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,260
[So everything about me]

615
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,080
[doesn't actually exist.]

616
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,530
Xiao Wudi, are you home?

617
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,840
Tell me if you're in there.

618
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,330
I'm really worried about you.

619
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,200
Mother, I'm home.

620
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,440
You're back.

621
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,520
[No.]

622
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,250
[I still don't know]

623
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,920
[how to face you.]

624
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,040
I prepared seafood feast for you.

625
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,400
You ordered a cake?

626
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,620
It's so adorable.

627
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,220
It can just be our dessert.

628
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,320
This is not for you.

629
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,650
Who is it for then?

630
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,690
Someone gave it to me.

631
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,400
So I can't have it?

632
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,000
No.

633
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,700
You can eat my stuff,

634
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,100
why can't

635
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,530
I eat yours?

636
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,850
Someone ordered me to keep it for him.

637
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,920
You can't eat it as well?

638
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,440
Okay then, forget it.

639
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,790
Wash your hands and let's have dinner.

640
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,020
Mother, I'm not eating.

641
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,420
I've already had my meal.

642
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,080
I want to go for a walk.

643
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,320
What about the seafood feast?

644
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,880
Why is he not back yet?

645
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,969
Will he take it too hard?

646
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,530
He won't.

647
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,560
He's not that foolish.

648
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,810
I can't look at you now.

649
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,330
But we can't stay apart forever, right?

650
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,700
I'm sorry, miss.

651
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm sorry, miss.

652
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,600
What are you looking at?

653
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,490
I'm not punishing her.

654
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,740
I just don't know

655
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,320
how to speak to her.

656
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,850
What do you want me to do then?

657
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,080
It's not her fault as well.

658
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,680
Also,

659
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,180
I didn't ask her to

660
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,360
wait me over there.

661
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,500
I told her

662
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,980
that I don't want to see her.

663
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,840
She insisted to stay there for me.

664
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,760
Can you blame me for it?

665
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,490
[What is she doing there?]

666
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:43,980
Doudou,

667
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,200
let's get back the mask from miss.

668
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,570
Miss, can you return

669
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,580
his mask?

670
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,800
Return me the mask.

671
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,610
Can you

672
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,460
lend it to me for a while longer?

673
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,370
No.

674
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,900
Nan Xing,

675
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,120
why are you wearing the mask?

676
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,220
I... I'm waiting for someone.

677
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,100
Who would wait for someone this way?

678
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,500
I know, you're waiting for Tang Sanzang.

679
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,900
Sun Wukong waits for Tang Sanzang.

680
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,760
Who is Tang Sanzang?

681
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,100
Tang Sanzang is...

682
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
Where is Tang Sanzang?

683
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,400
Master!
