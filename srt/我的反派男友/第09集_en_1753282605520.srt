Write down the most touching story

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's the time I met you

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Before the promise is made

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I throw away the pen

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And call out my name

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the distant space

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I hear you here

You're destined to be with me

Stay with me

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You are the past and the past

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A life that never changes

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Come for me

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Stay with me

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000

Is it good?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's good

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You don't eat it

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You'll melt if you don't eat it

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Look

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll help you

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I just ate this

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I want to eat it too

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No need

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can do it by myself

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000

I'm sorry

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,380
Thanks.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm a little anxious when I get closer

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My feelings are beyond the reach

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Waiting for the wish to come true

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
At this moment, you're willing to guess

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How used to the future every day

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I hear the heart beat faster

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Tell me why

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're always by my side

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Maybe it's fate

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When I see your eyes

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Even if it's the light of time

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's love

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm waiting for the wish to come true

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
At this moment, you're willing to guess

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How used to the future every day

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I hear the heart beat faster

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tell me why

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're always by my side

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe it's fate

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When I see your eyes

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Even if it's the light of time

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's love

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Tell me why

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're always by my side

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Maybe it's fate

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When I see your eyes

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Even if it's the light of time

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's love

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Leng Xing

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Leng Xing

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why don't you answer the phone?

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What time did you come back yesterday?

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I didn't hear anything

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I remember

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I drank with Si Si and them yesterday

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Then I went

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you drunk?

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Look at your clothes

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're wearing shoes

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You didn't wash your face, right?

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Get up

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't drink with Si Si and him yesterday

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I drank with myself

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Come on, get up

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're so...

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where are you going?

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Opposite

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Xiao Wu Di

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Xiao Wu Di

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you up?

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Xiao Wu Di

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Xiao Wu Di

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you up?

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're so early

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're so late

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So early

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Good morning

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Good morning

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The moon was so beautiful last night

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You were even more beautiful last night

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's wrong with you?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I woke up in the morning

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've been through the activity

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm about to take a shower

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You should go back to work

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or you'll be late

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can't go

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I have to take a shower

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm going to take a shower

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You should go back to work

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or you'll be late

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I...

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I...

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Actually

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want to ask you

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Did I come to you last night?

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Last night?

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I slept so soundly

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
From half a night to just now

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I slept so soundly

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I didn't even know that I was hit by a thunder

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Really?

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Really

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Am I dreaming?

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I shouldn't have

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Beer, ice cream

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
None of them

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What are you talking about?

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Eat

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Eat

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's go

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll go in and check

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You just woke up

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Last night

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I slept like this for a whole night

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Maybe I was drunk and had a dream

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Young Master

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why is your room so messy?

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you sleeping or fighting?

206
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Young Master

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Young Master

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What are you looking for me for?

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you have nothing to do, go home

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay?

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You didn't lie to me

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I didn't come last night

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You lied to me

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's a dog

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
A dog

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
A dog

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A cover

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, I'll go now

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That USB

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I've deleted everything in the USB

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Do you still want the USB?

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't want it

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you want me to take it and do it?

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What's wrong with you?

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you uncomfortable?

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do you have a fever?

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's okay

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Go back to work quickly

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You don't need to be late anymore

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I should go to work

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm leaving now

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Take care of yourself

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Bye bye

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't let him know about the lawsuit

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yang Xing

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm leaving

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hurry up or you'll be late

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Miss

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Miss, I'm sorry

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The boss asked you to go to his office

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Come in

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Drink coffee

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't listen to the gossip

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't listen to the gossip

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Can we do business well?

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Boss

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's the matter with you?

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was in good shape last night

254
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll change it again tonight

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You can hand in the draft

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Come to me tomorrow morning

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Give it to the editors

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
By the way, tell them

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I've read the new plan

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll give it to you

261
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll give it to you

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll give it to you

263
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I've read the new plan

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You can participate in my process

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay

266
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll take a day off after handing in the draft

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You go to help me make an appointment

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Mr. Ye's time

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why do you ask Mr. Ye?

270
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you think is better?

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm asking for my friend

273
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I can ask him to do something

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He's interested in

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Interested

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Then you let him

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Spend more time

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
How can I talk to him?

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can play it at will

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, I'll play it at will

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
it is good

283
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
it is good

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Throw away

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Everything related to you

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Xiao Di

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Xiao Di

288
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Xiao Di, look at the road

290
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He said

291
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,520
I want you to stay as long as possible

292
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,960
Okay, I know

293
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,120
You don't ask me what I should do?

294
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,120
Your boss

295
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,880
He has his reasons

296
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
You can't ask him

297
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,760
What's wrong?

298
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,840
You are so great

299
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,120
I didn't say anything

300
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,360
And you guessed it

301
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,560
Because I just came here

302
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,520
You can just do your job

303
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Mr. Ye

304
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,400
I want to know

305
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,320
One should be an excellent assistant

306
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,040
Either sitting in front of boss

307
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
Sitting in front of boss

308
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,320
An assistant

309
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,440
Will do whatever he is asked

310
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,360
If he is an outstanding assistant

311
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Especially when you meet such a strange boss

312
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
You have to work harder to read his mind

313
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Get ready in advance

314
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Is he hard to understand?

315
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
He's really weird, right?

316
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
It's okay, you've done a good job

317
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Keep working

318
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
I know

319
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Thank you, Mr. Ye, go back to work

320
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
illusion

321
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
This must be an illusion again

322
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Why don't you say hello to me?

323
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Why are you back?

324
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm off work

325
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Go home after work

326
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Why sit here?

327
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
I called you, you didn't answer

328
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Miss An's birthday today, I'll teach you together

329
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'm not going

330
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
why

331
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You have something

332
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Or do you have any plans?

333
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
What plan can I have?

334
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Then together

335
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
No way

336
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
I have a poison

337
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
If I celebrate someone's birthday

338
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Within three days, the meridians are broken

339
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
What the hell

340
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Go back to the water

341
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Why is there water in the house?

342
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
What's going on?

343
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
How did it happen?

344
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Don't touch it, you take the towel

345
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
You take your hand away

346
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
Nothing, nothing

347
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm using the towel to block

348
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I'll do it

349
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
I'll do it

350
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Don't touch it

351
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Don't touch it

352
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
This water

353
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
This is so bad

354
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
You clean it up

355
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,240
Jaguar

356
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,240
Don't touch me

357
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
Hurry up I'll just do it

358
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,000
But, but

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,760
I'll just do it

360
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,800
Then I will call the adjustment

361
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,000
Wen Xin

362
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,880
Mom

363
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,080
Why are you doing this?

364
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Xiao Wu Di re-opened his water pipe

365
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,560
Water pipe

366
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,320
How's it going in the house?

367
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,680
It's just a little bit.

368
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,240
But it's not that serious.

369
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,560
I'll call the maintenance company later.

370
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
Okay.

371
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,880
When the room is done,

372
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
you can clean it up.

373
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
We can ask Xiao Qing out.

374
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
She doesn't want to go.

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,960
What's wrong?

376
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,720
I don't know why.

377
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,520
She seems to be very angry.

378
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
You must have bullied her again.

379
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,920
I didn't.

380
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,600
Why would I bully her?

381
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
Okay, okay, okay.

382
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,160
Go and change your clothes.

383
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,640
I'll go and see what's going on.

384
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,120
Okay.

385
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
Okay.

386
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
This way, please.

387
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Okay.

388
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
You have a lot of clothes.

389
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,160
Thank you.

390
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,760
Sit.

391
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
Thank you.

392
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,760
Let me see what you want to eat.

393
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Did Miss An ask you to come?

394
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,760
Yes.

395
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Xiao Xiong,

396
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,960
can I order

397
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
a M9 beef for you?

398
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,160
It's delicious and not fat.

399
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,960
Okay.

400
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,560
What do I order for my birthday?

401
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,960
Wen Xin, what pizza do you want?

402
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
I want this

403
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
cooked ham,

404
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
mushroom, sesame, and vegetable pizza.

405
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,760
Thank you.

406
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
That's it.

407
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,960
Do you want anything?

408
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,760
Cheng Chi bought one today and gave one away.

409
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,160
I want apple juice.

410
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Okay.

411
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Is that okay?

412
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,160
I don't drink much on my birthday.

413
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,360
Xiao Xiong,

414
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,760
drink some red wine with me.

415
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Okay.

416
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
On my birthday,

417
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,960
I'll drink red wine.

418
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,160
Here you are.

419
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Thank you.

420
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Please enjoy.

421
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Come on.

422
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,360
Thank you for

423
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
celebrating my birthday.

424
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,360
Happy birthday, Mom.

425
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
Is this delicious?

426
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Yes.

427
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Mr. Zhou,

428
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,560
do you want to order a pizza?

429
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Yes.

430
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Okay.

431
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,360
Happy birthday to you.

432
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,760
Happy birthday to you.

433
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,560
Happy birthday to you.

434
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,760
Happy birthday to you.

435
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,960
Thank you.

436
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Wait.

437
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,960
Make a wish.

438
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
People say

439
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,960
you must make a wish before you make it.

440
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,560
My first wish is

441
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,160
to be more and more beautiful.

442
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
My second wish is

443
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,960
to wish that we can find a person

444
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,360
who loves you,

445
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
cares about you,

446
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,160
and listens to you.

447
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
My third wish is

448
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
to wish that we can

449
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,560
be safe and healthy

450
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,760
like Xiao Xiong and I.

451
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay.

452
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,760
Blow out the candles.

453
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,160
I'll cut the cake.

454
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,760
It looks good.

455
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,160
Mom, you're here again.

456
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Once a year,

457
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,960
we must keep the tradition.

458
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,960
Okay.

459
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,760
You...

460
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,960
I...

461
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll go to the bathroom.

462
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,960
I...

463
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,360
Where can I put up with this?

464
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,960
If you can't, then don't.

465
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,160
Auntie.

466
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,360
Be it happy or not,

467
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
just say it.

468
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,160
Don't hold it in.

469
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Look at you.

470
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
How bad it is.

471
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,760
Auntie, you know?

472
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,160
Of course I know.

473
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
You just bought the cake.

474
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,360
You're just like my son.

475
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,760
No, it's just that

476
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,160
it's my aunt's birthday today.

477
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
I didn't prepare any birthday gifts.

478
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,560
I should do this.

479
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,360
Don't do it next time.

480
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,760
Are you full?

481
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,560
Yes.

482
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,960
Get in the car.

483
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,160
Get in the car.

484
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,360
Auntie, I want to take a walk.

485
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
You go home first.

486
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,760
What about you?

487
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,360
Mom, you go home first.

488
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Why are you all leaving?

489
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,960
Xiaowudi.

490
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,160
Xiaowudi, what's wrong with you?

491
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,560
Is it because

492
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,160
I rubbed the cake on your face?

493
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,960
Are you angry?

494
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,760
Didn't you rub it on my face too?

495
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Let's talk about it.

496
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
You're following me again?

497
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,760
Or you don't want to come here today?

498
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,360
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
Next time, I'll go to the place you like.

500
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,960
I'm leaving.

501
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,560
No.

502
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,160
What's wrong with you?

503
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,760
What's wrong with you?

504
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,160
What's wrong with me?

505
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
Don't you know what you did?

506
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:54,960
I...

507
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,360
I mean, you've been

508
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
scolding me all day.

509
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
Can't you feel my feelings?

510
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
That's right.

511
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,560
He came here alone.

512
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,760
I called him and he went.

513
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Even my mom

514
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,960
can make him run around.

515
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,360
There's nothing he likes.

516
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,960
It's normal for him to be angry.

517
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,560
Don't think about him.

518
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Hi,66 refreshed!

519
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,840
You don't recognize Mr Zhang, o

520
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,760
n.

521
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,160
What?

522
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,160
I looked out

523
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,360
outside on a photo shoot.

524
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:05,960
He came in.

525
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,960
What?

526
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,760
You also came in?

527
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,520
What should I do to make her stop thinking about me?

528
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,920
Good.

529
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,000
What do you want Na Ying to think about?

530
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't agree with it Ma Ye.

531
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,580
Neeze did teach West Lake policemenified giving money to Jing An.

532
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,280
Come, come, come.

533
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,840
Why not at least?

534
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,800
Don't stop at the same time.

535
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,800
He probably started let two sex workers

536
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,200
provide him with a coat of arms,

537
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,580
and 1986?

538
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
Do we want to keep this a secret?

539
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Love

540
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
is define as

541
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:27,360
labě unfair

542
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,260
good mood

543
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:36,260
feeling

544
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
but

545
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,760
problem

546
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Oh, in all,

547
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,560
the feeling of liking someone is like coughing.

548
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,560
You can't help it. Once he's good to you,

549
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,360
no matter how strong the defense line is, it will collapse.

550
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,160
Then there's no way.

551
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,360
Young Master, we're home.

552
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm home.

553
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,160
I've thought about it.

554
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,360
It's always my fault that you have to cooperate with me.

555
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm home.

556
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Let's do something you like tomorrow.

557
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,760
How about the secret room? I'll take care of the people.

558
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,360
I've tried many things since I came here.

559
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,160
This ice cream and the new secret room escape.

560
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,960
That seems interesting.

561
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,360
I only said it once and I remember it.

562
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
No, no, no.

563
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
No, no, no.

564
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,760
I have to protect my own room.

565
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,760
What can I do to help you?

566
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
I'm home.

567
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Why isn't he back yet?

568
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,560
It's a bit long. I'll take care of the people first.

569
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,760
Jianghu Rescue Department, 2nd to 4th Personn Secret Room.

570
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
I'll pay. Who wants to come?

571
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
I'll do it.

572
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
I'll make the reservation.

573
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Okay.

574
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Jianghu Rescue Department, 2nd to 4th Personn Secret Room.

575
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Jianghu Rescue Department, 2nd to 4th Personn Secret Room.

576
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Jianghu Rescue Department, 2nd to 4th Personn Secret Room.

577
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Forget it.

578
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,760
What if he's still angry?

579
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
I'll go in.

580
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
This is really nice.

581
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
I noticed you have his work on your desk.

582
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
So I can take you in.

583
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Yes, I'm very patient with his work.

584
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
Let's go.

585
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
This artist is from the original painting world.

586
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
He has worked with many big game companies in China.

587
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
He has participated in many big game development.

588
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Look.

589
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
His work, style, boldness, and potential, is very special.

590
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
But most people only focus on his form.

591
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
They ignore the meaning of his work.

592
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
He's very good at drawing.

593
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
He's very good at drawing.

594
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
He's very good at drawing.

595
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
He's very good at drawing.

596
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
He's very good at drawing.

597
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
He's very good at drawing.

598
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
He's very good at drawing.

599
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
He's very good at drawing.

600
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,760
This is the first time he hasn't been on the set.

601
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,860
I've contacted him about this

602
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,760
on the internet before.

603
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
But we didn't get to see each other.

604
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Have you spoken to him?

605
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Yes, I would like to cooperate with him.

606
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
His work is often out of fashion.

607
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
And I think

608
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,760
If his style is all your work,

609
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
there might be a different style. Don't you think so?

610
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Yes.

611
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,760
It's him. It seems to be that painter.

612
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,760
I was in contact with you on the Internet. My name is Ye Qing.

613
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
I remember. I have an impression.

614
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,760
When we were on the Internet, I expressed my suggestion to you.

615
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Do you have any thoughts about these suggestions?

616
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,760
The content of his book is not very compatible with the theme I usually choose.

617
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
So I want to know why you chose me.

618
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
If I keep using the previous painter, it may be very safe.

619
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
But I always hide in the comfort zone.

620
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,760
I will lose the passion for creation.

621
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Your work may not be the same style as ours.

622
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,760
But I really appreciate some of the deep meanings expressed in your work.

623
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
No wonder you asked me to stay longer.

624
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
He is really interested in my suggestions.

625
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
He also invited us to his studio.

626
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,760
There is an artistic party tonight.

627
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Then you go.

628
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
I'm not good at crowded places.

629
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
That's right.

630
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,760
But anyway, today is a big surprise.

631
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Thank you.

632
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,760
I'll go and see other works.

633
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I just want to come out and have a chat with you.

634
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
The appointment is done. 6.30.

635
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,760
The artist can really make people calm.

636
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
You must stay down.

637
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Okay?

638
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I'm going to the studio.

639
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I'll be back in a minute.

640
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Okay.

641
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
I'll be back in a minute.

642
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Okay.

643
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
I'll be back in a minute.

644
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
I'll be back in a minute.

645
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Who is this artist?

646
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Amazing.

647
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh my god!

648
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
What's this?

649
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Just an image taken with больше.

650
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
No one saw this.

651
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
He said, I these two moments,

652
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,760
can I spend them together on the mirror?

653
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
I can!

654
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
You are really good atacer.

655
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Can, can!

656
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
That's right.

657
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,680
Sit until your hands are on the left side of the bed.

658
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,280
Yes, hold on.

659
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,200
Okay, let's slowly get up.

660
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,840
Very good. Very good.

661
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,320
Straighten your legs.

662
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,000
Classmate, straighten your legs a little bit.

663
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,920
Straighten them a little bit.

664
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,760
Let's straighten them a little bit.

665
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
Let's see, classmate.

666
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,320
A little bit better.

667
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,720
Straighten them a little bit.

668
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,880
Teacher, I don't want to sit anymore.

669
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,760
Let me go.

670
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,120
Okay, everyone, your legs are sick.

671
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,320
Come on, come on.

672
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,280
Wait for me.

673
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
Wait a minute.

674
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Wait a minute.

675
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,080
Okay.

676
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,280
That was amazing.

677
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,600
Don't panic.

678
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Thank you.

679
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,560
The seat can be suffered now.

680
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,400
Side Cameo

681
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,460
Let's continue

682
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,240
Hurry

683
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,060
Wait

684
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,540
What are you looking, rated 3?

685
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,600
1

686
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,880

687
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,520
Wanyu

688
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,680
Such a resemblance

689
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,800
Damn it

690
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,800
I can't figure it out

691
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,560
It's so vast

692
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,640
I don't know who is more convenient

693
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,080

694
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,560
I will go to reduabil for it

695
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,200

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,880

697
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,640

700
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
Just wait

701
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,580
Open

702
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,920
What changes?

703
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Nothing

704
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,720
Xiao Gu Di

705
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,600
You finally answered my call

706
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,320
Did you receive my message?

707
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,560
Not interested

708
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,880
You really don't like it?

709
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,560
I'll hang up now

710
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,560
Wait

711
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,360
Where are you now?

712
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,800
None of your business

713
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,760
Help

714
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,040
He's not interested

715
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,960
I asked him out on purpose

716
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
What should we do now?

717
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,600
How about they hang out together?

718
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,680
I'll go to pay the bill

719
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,840
I called you again
