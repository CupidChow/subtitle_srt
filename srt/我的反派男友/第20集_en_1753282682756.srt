1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
In the First Half

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,540
Of Our Lives

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,480
pills

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,160
Coroffen

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,940
작nor

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,980
When we obsequed

7
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,980
Come with me

8
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
Come to me

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Stay with me

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
You are the past and the self

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,980
The life that never changes

12
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Come for me

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,980
Stay for me

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,980
You look back at my heart

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,980
I'll be with me

16
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Mr. Right

17
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,980
Episode 10

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,980
Where is An Jia?

19
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,980
I need you to sign here

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
You...

21
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,980
An Xing

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,980
The boss has no place to live

23
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,980
The company won't collapse, right?

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,980
The boss just has a problem with the house

25
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
He will stay in the office for the time being

26
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,980
The company won't collapse

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
You already know

28
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
Then you don't tell me

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
The company has so many people

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
It's not good to let people see

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
An Xing, I have a bunch of documents

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Wait for the boss to sign

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,980
Go away

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
I have a bunch of documents

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,980
Boss, I'm on leave

36
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,980
This is the deposit

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Here, sign here

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,980
What's the hurry?

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Why do you have to let me put some business here?

40
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Drink it yourself

41
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,980
The boss has sold the house

42
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,980
Now people live in the company

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,980
You were in charge of the business before the company

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Now everything is on the boss

45
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,980
There are all kinds of contracts on the desk

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,980
I can't handle it alone

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Let alone the creation

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,980
The serial has stopped last week

49
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,980
Because he can't write anything

50
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,980
This week

51
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,980
Today is the deadline

52
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,980
He still can't write it

53
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
I guess I can only stop

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,980
I don't know what to do

55
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,980
President Ye, he only listens to you

56
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,980
Can you change your mind

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,980
Back to the company

58
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
I have tried to ask him

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,980
He doesn't want me to care

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,980
You all used to think he listens to me

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,980
Actually he has his own ideas

62
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,980
And our relationship now

63
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
He won't listen to me

64
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Sure enough

65
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,980
I can't solve any problems for the boss

66
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
I ran over to make you a bet

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,980
It's ok

68
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,980
Look, I bought you something delicious

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,980
I just passed by a cake shop

70
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
I saw this bear cake, it's so cute

71
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I bought it for you

72
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
How do you like it?

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,980
What's wrong, Nanxing?

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
What happened?

75
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Why are you crying?

76
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
Do you want to talk to me?

77
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,980
I need to answer the phone

78
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Hello, boss

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
Ok, I'll be back soon

80
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,980
The draft is out

81
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
I need to go back and call the team

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Do you want to go back with me?

83
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
Go

84
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
I'll go first

85
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
I'm leaving

86
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Come in

87
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Boss

88
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
You still kicked the draft out

89
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
It's all here

90
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Please check it for me

91
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
If there's no problem, send it to the chief

92
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
He's waiting for you

93
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Ok

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Sorry

95
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,980
I asked you to come so late

96
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,980
I'll be on time in the future

97
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
It's ok

98
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,980
There's no draft in the book

99
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
And the draft is to be established

100
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
In a creative environment

101
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
I have so many things to do now

102
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
It's good to be able to hand in the draft

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
When I was in a state of mind

104
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
I always feel that I made a mistake

105
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Boss

106
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Why don't you live with your parents?

107
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
I don't want to

108
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
Then I'll find a hotel for you

109
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,980
I used all my money to buy back the company's shares

110
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
Why can't I get it?

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Is it missing?

112
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
I'll go find it

113
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
Boss

114
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Fire

115
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
I'll go get some gas

116
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
Boss

117
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Help

118
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Little Fire

119
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Little Fire

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Little Fire

121
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
Help

122
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Little Fire, help

123
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Little Fire

124
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Little Fire

125
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Little Fire

126
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Lan Xin

127
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Little Fire

128
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Little Fire

129
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Little Fire

130
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Go back

131
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
You have conditions

132
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,980
You are the fairy

133
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
You help me complete a task

134
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,980
These tasks, time and price are not important

135
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
I promise you

136
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
I promise you

137
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
I'm going back to save her now, do you understand?

138
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Understand

139
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,980
But if your love will eventually be tragic

140
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,980
Will you still agree?

141
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
By then

142
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
All the pain

143
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
I have to bear it alone

144
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Cut the crap

145
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
I promise you

146
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I promise you

147
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Little Fire

148
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Little Fire

149
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Little Fire

150
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I miss you so much

151
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
You're finally back

152
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
Let go

153
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Don't touch me

154
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
You are so shameless

155
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
You just hug me

156
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
OC

157
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Where is this

158
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Who are you

159
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Why am I here

160
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
You don't know me

161
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
I need to know you

162
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,620
The wild blood

163
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm Nanxing, I'm your girlfriend.

164
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,420
Will not be extinguished

165
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:48,900
I thought it would not be extinguished

166
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,980
Little boy

167
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
Where are you going?

168
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,020
Where I love to go

169
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,300
Who dares to stop

170
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,180
Why don't you remember me?

171
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,740
I understand

172
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,500
You are attracted by my beauty

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Ok, I understand

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Love beauty, know the heart, know the world

175
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
But I have something ugly to tell you

176
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
If you follow me again

177
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Don't blame me for letting you go

178
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
You are Xiaodi

179
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm not only a girl

180
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I'm also a girl

181
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I not only know you are Xiaodi

182
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I also know you are the son of He Huan

183
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
The first devil in the world

184
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
You think you are

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
An ancient person who crossed 500 years ago

186
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
But in fact you are the character I wrote in my novel

187
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
It's a love that I made with God

188
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
You are my best friend

189
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
In this world, except my mother

190
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
The closest person

191
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I am the only one

192
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
The one who dares to confess

193
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,500
You are the one I miss the most in this world

194
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
You are a bunch of nonsense

195
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
You are a bunch of nonsense

196
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Don't follow me anymore

197
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I tell you

198
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I don't understand what you are talking about

199
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I don't want to understand what you are talking about

200
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
It's up to you

201
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
What's wrong

202
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
How are you, are you hurt

203
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Nothing

204
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Of course.

205
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,540
Have some food. I'll go clean up.

206
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,440
No need.

207
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll call someone else to do it tomorrow.

208
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,240
Anyway, I'm staying at my parents' house.

209
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,040
My house is in vacancy. How about you move there?

210
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,240
It's fine.

211
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,280
I live here for work convenience

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,120
I have a lot of places to go

213
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
So I've been handling

214
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,160
the company's business well

215
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,840
Don't worry

216
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,280
I eat

217
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,200
you

218
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,080
How are you doing

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm fine

220
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
I can't answer the phone anymore

221
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
I can't finish reading the documents

222
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,680
I don't have much time

223
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,440
But I'm not used to it

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's good

225
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,200
You can do what you like when you have time

226
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,680
You don't have to worry about the company

227
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,960
Go back and rest

228
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,060
okay

229
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,140
Take care of yourself

230
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,480
Don't stay.

231
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
How many minutes have I passed?

232
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
That is she.

233
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,280
If you don't meet her,

234
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,200
that person will talk the other way,

235
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,160
or pretend to know you.

236
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,040
If you don't meet her,

237
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
it'll be bad for yourãy.

238
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Anyway,

239
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,600
if you meet her again,

240
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,920
it's bad.

241
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,920
If your love will be tragic, will you still agree?

242
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,920
By then, all the pain will be on your own.

243
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Let go.

244
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,920
You don't recognize me anymore. I'm Nan Xing. I'm your girlfriend.

245
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm your girlfriend.

246
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,920
You're my best friend.

247
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,920
You're the closest person to me in this world, except for my mom.

248
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,920
You're the only one who dares to confess to me.

249
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,920
You're the person I miss the most in this world.

250
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,920
You're a bunch of nonsense.

251
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,920
If I don't be with you this time,

252
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,920
you won't lose your love again.

253
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Mom.

254
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,920
What did you say to her?

255
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
No way.

256
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm not going to let her go.

257
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I'm not going to let her go.

258
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm not going to let her go.

259
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
I'm not going to let her go.

260
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
No way.

261
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,920
She did this to me?

262
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I know.

263
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Good night.

264
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Why haven't I come back yet?

265
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Is it dangerous?

266
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm back.

267
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I'm back.

268
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Even if I make you happy,

269
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
you don't have to be so happy.

270
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Even if you really believe that I lost my memory,

271
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,920
you can't just leave me alone.

272
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
I've been your boyfriend before.

273
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm so sad today.

274
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Help me, Xia Wudi.

275
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Get out of here.

276
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
What's going on?

277
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Why am I here?

278
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Did you use some kind of magic?

279
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Even though you don't remember,

280
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
we're just friends.

281
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,920
You have to show up when I call you.

282
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Come on, take off your clothes.

283
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Take off my clothes?

284
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,920
You're not hot in that many clothes.

285
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm so mad.

286
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Go wash your feet.

287
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Don't touch me.

288
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Who are you?

289
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Do I know you?

290
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
How many times do I have to tell you?

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm your girlfriend.

292
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,920
You're the one I called.

293
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
You have to do what I ask you to do.

294
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Otherwise, you're just a security guard.

295
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Do you understand?

296
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
No.

297
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Xia Wudi, help me.

298
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Go wash your feet.

299
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Xia Wudi, help me.

300
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
The bathroom is over there.

301
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Please.

302
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
You're shameless.

303
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
In my memory,

304
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,920
you're not a person who's convinced by the Li family.

305
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Xia Wudi, help me.

306
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Go wash your feet.

307
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Don't be so hard on me.

308
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm just kidding.

309
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Go.

310
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
I've already washed the bathtub.

311
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
You're crazy.

312
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
We put on some make up,

313
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
and it's really bad.

314
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,920
It's terrible.

315
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Hopefully I'll not be able to see this in the future.

316
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
I can't see her.

317
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
What am I doing with this?

318
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Come on.

319
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,440
Why is this dress so ugly?

320
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,320
Don't you have any other clothes?

321
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,680
All the other clothes are my boyfriend's.

322
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,480
Are you my boyfriend?

323
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,520
Xia Ru Di!

324
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Do you really not remember me?

325
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,120
I don't remember. I already said it.

326
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,920
You might have been restarted.

327
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,120
What do you mean?

328
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,520
Just like your phone. You were restarted.

329
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,920
You don't remember me after you've cleared your memory.

330
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,120
As long as I restore your data, you can remember it.

331
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,920
I don't understand.

332
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,120
Come here!

333
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,320
Why should I go there?

334
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
Just...

335
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
Jing Jing, just sleep here.

336
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
This isn't suitable.

337
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
What's not suitable?

338
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,920
I'll just pretend that you're not my boyfriend.

339
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,120
You don't have a place to stay tonight.

340
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,320
Why must you make it hard for yourself?

341
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,520
Miss, I think you're quite nice.

342
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,720
I suggest that you should forget about your boyfriend.

343
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,320
Start a new life soon.

344
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,920
You...

345
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Anxin.

346
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,920
Boss, you're here.

347
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
What do you mean?

348
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,320
She asked me to stay here for a few days.

349
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,520
Boss, I just took care of my own business.

350
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,320
I didn't mean to leave you here alone. I'm sorry.

351
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,520
It's fine. I've taken care of it.

352
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,320
Director Ye came by?

353
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Although I don't know what happened between you two,

354
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm still happy that you're here.

355
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,520
I'm glad that you're here.

356
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
I'm glad that you're here.

357
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Although I don't know what happened between you two,

358
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I think she cares about you.

359
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,520
Why don't you find her again?

360
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,720
With her helping you, your stress will be lessened.

361
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,320
I've known her for so long.

362
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,920
She's always helping me solve my problems.

363
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,720
She doesn't have time to rest now. I don't want to bother her.

364
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,120
Okay.

365
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
I'll help you clean up.

366
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,320
No need. Go back and rest.

367
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,520
Where are you sleeping?

368
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
On the sofa.

369
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,320
The sofa...

370
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,920
Find another way tomorrow.

371
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Boss, I'll help you put your luggage in.

372
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,920
Come in.

373
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,520
Aren't you leaving? Go.

374
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,720
I don't have a place to stay tonight.

375
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,520
Why must I live with myself?

376
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,320
Then I'll stay here.

377
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,120
No.

378
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,320
You're not leaving?

379
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,120
I'm leaving.

380
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,320
Boss, wait for me.

381
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,520
I have something to say to her.

382
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,120
Come in.

383
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm leaving.

384
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Stop pretending. Aren't you tired?

385
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Who's pretending? What did I pretend?

386
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
You pretended to be amnesiac.

387
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
When did you start to act like this? Everyone's tired of seeing you.

388
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I didn't pretend to be amnesiac.

389
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
You didn't?

390
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,720
I've never seen any ancient person waiting for the traffic light.

391
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
You're too uncute right now.

392
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,120
How am I uncute?

393
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,320
You clearly know why you didn't say anything.

394
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I'm like a fool.

395
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,920
I'm trying to... I'm trying to make you understand.

396
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Who knows you'll get more and more aggressive.

397
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
You're a smart girl.

398
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,520
But you're even better when you're stupid.

399
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,320
So what? Let's break up?

400
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,520
Okay. I can't help but ask.

401
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
The left...

402
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
was right.

403
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,320
So there is something wrong.

404
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
I must explain it to you.

405
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,720
What're you getting at?

406
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,120
Why are you laughing?

407
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,120
This is Support example 2.

408
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,920
Why on earth are you laughing?

409
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm fine.

410
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
I can't answer the phone call anymore.

411
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
I can't finish reading the documents either.

412
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,920
You don't need to worry too much about the company.

413
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I'm fine.

414
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,920
So if it's really like what that fairy said,

415
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,920
I'll be in the real world for a very short time.

416
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,920
I guess as long as I complete that task,

417
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I'll have to return to the world in the book immediately.

418
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,920
It will be another victory and death.

419
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,920
You went through that fire at that time.

420
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I don't want you to suffer such a pain again.

421
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,920
So you decided to pretend to be amnesiac?

422
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,920
But amnesia can't solve any problems.

423
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I know.

424
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,920
But when I came back and saw you,

425
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I didn't know how to say it.

426
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
My brain was blank.

427
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Your brain was blank?

428
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Aren't you smart?

429
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
This is called caring for the mess.

430
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I'm unlucky on you.

431
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Okay, okay, okay. Blame me. Blame me.

432
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
You can think for me.

433
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm very grateful.

434
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,920
But a lot of things are only understood after they are lost.

435
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
What do you understand?

436
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Didn't I say before that if I miss the present,

437
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
no matter what the future results are,

438
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I will definitely regret it.

439
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,920
So at that time, I was ready.

440
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
No matter what the result is,

441
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
I only know that we are together now.

442
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
But it was just a guess.

443
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Now it's confirmed.

444
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,920
How can you be sure that I can't bear it?

445
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Don't be so pessimistic.

446
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,920
Even if the result really becomes like that in the future,

447
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I believe I can also deal with it.

448
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
This...

449
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Little Wu Di, you are a girl from the underworld.

450
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Can you be a little more cool?

451
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I want to be cool, too.

452
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Then I can't just be cool with you.

453
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
You are my first love.

454
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Really?

455
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Yes.

456
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I...

457
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,920
I just said a few words casually to coax you.

458
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
So nice.

459
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Do you feel better now?

460
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
It's all your fault.

461
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
I didn't know how nice it was.

462
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
You are...

463
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
You are a villain.

464
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Why haven't you left yet?

465
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
What's wrong, boss?

466
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
It's late.

467
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
And then?

468
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I have to write a draft tomorrow.

469
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
And then?

470
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
It's time to sleep.

471
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Go home and sleep when it's time to sleep.

472
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
I know.

473
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I'll take care of it.

474
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,920
How can you sleep in the summer?

475
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
It's a bit complicated.

476
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
I'll explain it to you later.

477
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
It's okay, boss.

478
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Come with me.

479
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll help you take your luggage.

480
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Boss,

481
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,920
although these bedding items are not new,

482
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
they are all washed and dried.

483
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
They are very clean.

484
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
You can use them first.

485
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

486
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
You two will live here for a while.

487
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
This room is familiar to Little Wu Di.

488
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
If you don't know anything, just ask him.

489
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I haven't even spoken yet.

490
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Why are you so dissatisfied?

491
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm just not used to

492
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
someone walking around the house.

493
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
I might be insomnia when I hear Little Wu Di.

494
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
This is not your house.

495
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
This is Nan Xin's house.

496
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
I'd better go back to the company.

497
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
But the company is on fire.

498
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
You'd better stay here.

499
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,920
He doesn't even have money to live in the hotel.

500
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
You should let him stay.

501
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
I just went back for a few days.

502
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
He has lost the company.

503
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
No, I'll explain it to you later.

504
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Boss, you should rest first.

505
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
We'll leave first.

506
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
I'll live across the street.

507
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
If you need anything, just send me a message.

508
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Rest early.

509
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I heard you talking about

510
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
the fairy and the amulet.

511
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Are you talking about the plot?

512
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Yes.

513
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Is the male lead

514
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,920
a little too evil?

515
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
What did you say?

516
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
We're just discussing it.

517
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
It's not really that evil.

518
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I'll go first. Bye.

519
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Have a good rest.

520
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Good night.

521
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Why don't you go back to sleep?

522
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
I haven't seen you for so long.

523
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Can't you look at me more?

524
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Sure.

525
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,920
One eye, two eyes, three eyes,

526
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
four eyes, five eyes.

527
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Is this enough?

528
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Not enough.

529
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Not enough?

530
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Then we'll see tomorrow.

531
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

532
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Good night.

533
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Good night.

534
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Good night.

535
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Hello?

536
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,060
Can you help me?

537
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,900
Please come with me days later.

538
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,160
Mr. Li,

539
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,160
if you don't receive the spy,

540
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,660
I must tell my husband

541
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,740
we've spoonful of antatsuas.

542
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,520
Don't understand?

543
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,700
I neeed other counterafterてs.

544
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,140
But in term of antatuas,

545
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,820
ate some HIV,

546
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,140
I need invincible drug.

547
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,460
Just give it to me.

548
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,020
We should go together.

549
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,620
Drink with me.

550
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,980
Stop talking nonsense.

551
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:22,900
My treat,

552
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,420
bought painting,

553
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,660
I keep everyone's serious about glass.

554
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,940
I won't be caught.

555
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,100
Good night.

556
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,540
Good night.

557
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,980
Da artistic world

558
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,100
Why are you here?

559
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,580
I 225g.

560
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,060
And it's not the first time.

561
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,060
It's not the first time.

562
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,060
You still have to do it many times.

563
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Go back and sleep.

564
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
I'm not going back.

565
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Lu Zichen is calling me.

566
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,060
It's so noisy that I can't sleep.

567
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,060
You two didn't sleep in the same room.

568
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,060
You're separated from each other.

569
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Your house is too quiet.

570
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,060
There's no partition.

571
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,060
You'll catch a cold if you sleep like this.

572
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Be good.

573
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Just one night.

574
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,060
It's not dawn yet.

575
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,060
You should go to sleep.

576
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Anyway, before auntie An comes tomorrow,

577
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I'll disappear.

578
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,060
See you're right

579
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:03,060
The light of the night is love

580
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
The sun shines a few thousand times

581
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,060
It brings a new day

582
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,060
I run with you

583
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
You are the god

584
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,060
Walk through my unique bridge

585
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,060
Take me with you

586
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Occasionally, I'm in your round smile

587
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,060
Maybe the atmosphere is just right

588
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,060
My warrior walks

589
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,060
Can drive away all my troubles

590
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,060
in time

591
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Every corner

592
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,060
Turned into the soil of love

593
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,060
A little bit of special relationship

594
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Maybe it represents my heart

595
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,060
Every sunset

596
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,060
Every sunset

597
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Every sunset

598
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,060
The next day

599
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,060
I accidentally got close to the tacit understanding

600
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Like to be your warrior

601
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,060
Now set out

602
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,060
The sun shines a few thousand times

603
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,060
It brings a new day

604
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,060
I run with you

605
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
You are the god

606
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,060
Walk through my unique bridge

607
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Take me with you

608
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Occasionally, I'm in your round smile

609
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Maybe the atmosphere is just right

610
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,060
My warrior

611
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Can drive away all my troubles

612
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,060
in time

613
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,060
Every corner

614
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,060
Turned into the soil of love

615
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,060
A little bit of special relationship

616
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Maybe it represents my heart

617
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Every sunset

618
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,060
Every sunset

619
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,060
The next day

620
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,060
I accidentally got close to the tacit understanding

621
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Like to be your warrior

622
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Now set out
