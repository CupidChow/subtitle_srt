[Mr. Bad]

3
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,190
[Episode 18]

4
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,380
Sorry.

5
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,220
I should've told you earlier.

6
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,620
You don't have to apologise to me.

7
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,259
You did nothing wrong.

8
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,700
This matter

9
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,180
is beyond your imagination.

10
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,860
You're not mad anymore?

11
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,330
I'm not mad

12
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,500
at you.

13
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,100
Then, can you be happy?

14
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,240
Actually, I know

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,020
what's on your mind.

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,060
You thought

17
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,200
you were

18
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,620
an ordinary ancient man.

19
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,700
But you never thought
that you're not a human at all.

20
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,740
I'm not insulting you.

21
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,500
I'm saying

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,560
you found out the fact

23
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,540
that you're a character from a novel.

24
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,890
This

25
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,780
is beyond your expectation.

26
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,420
It's impactful.

27
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,740
Particularly,

28
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm the writer of this novel.

29
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,020
Which means I'm your creator.

30
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,880
In other words,

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,220
I'm your mother.

32
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,580
It makes sense that you don't want

33
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,220
to date your mum.

34
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,340
Seriously,

35
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
I never thought about this before.

36
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,540
What about now?

37
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,620
I feel a little discomfort now.

38
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,860
What am I talking about?

39
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,900
Never mind.

40
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,540
Actually, this doesn't matter.

41
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,820
Then, what is it that matters?

42
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,730
Anything that you think it's important,

43
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,260
I'll fulfil it for you.

44
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,660
You can't help me with this.

45
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,410
How would you know

46
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,090
that I can't help you
if you don't tell me?

47
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
Just tell me.

48
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,660
What is it that you think

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,820
it matters the most?

50
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,780
I...

51
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,700
I actually think

52
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,920
that my current life

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,180
holds no meaning at all.

54
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,899
When I first came here,

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,769
at least I knew

56
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,860
who I was.

57
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,260
I was lost that time

58
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,420
but I knew

59
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,940
where I came from.

60
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
I, Xiao Wudi, was the smartest

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,020
and the strongest person in the world.

62
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,500
But now I realise

63
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,740
that everything is false.

64
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,780
I'm not the person

65
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,420
who I thought I was.

66
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,310
I'm not

67
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,300
the Xiao Wudi.

68
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,400
What is

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,980
the point of me staying alive?

70
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,980
You don't need a reason to be alive.

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,140
Don't think too much.

72
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,500
This is my problem.

73
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,890
You don't have to think

74
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,220
about such complicated thing with me.

75
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,700
It won't do.

76
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,820
I've got to be responsible for you.

77
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,260
Don't treat me like your son.

78
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,140
I got it.

79
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,700
Just give me

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,780
two days

81
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,100
to think about it.

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,420
Maybe I can figure it out.

83
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,250
What if you can't?

84
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,970
I wish I could.

85
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,260
Then, promise me.

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,620
You must figure it out.

87
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,460
Is this something that I can control?

88
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,940
Just promise me.

89
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,100
Okay.

90
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,940
I promise you.

91
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,890
Is there anything else?

92
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,380
Tell me if you've figured it out.

93
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,140
Nan Xing,

94
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,340
don't lock the door.

95
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,980
I'm going out too.

96
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,740
Okay.

97
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,830
[Have you figured it out today?]

98
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,320
[If yes, give me a call.
If no, buy an ice cream to eat.]

99
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,820
Bye bye.

100
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,580
Good morning, Miss Ye.

101
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,340
Good morning.

102
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,020
Good morning, Miss Ye.

103
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,500
Good morning.

104
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,300
Good morning, Miss Ye.

105
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,140
Good morning.

106
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,370
Miss Ye.

107
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,900
Who told you that?

108
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,700
I didn't tell you because I didn't want

109
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,300
this to happen.

110
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,700
Sister Qing.

111
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,820
Jiaojiao, you're so pragmatic.

112
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
They say
that human relationship is superficial.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,020
I haven't left.

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,940
And you call me Sister Qing
instead of Miss Ye.

115
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,780
Let's see.

116
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,260
Don't cry.

117
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,220
You don't look pretty when you cry.

118
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,410
Girls are not allowed to cry.

119
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,260
It breaks my heart when you cry.

120
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Both of you are men.

121
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,620
Why do you cry like this?

122
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,020
I've never seen you

123
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,860
like this before.

124
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,460
I have to take a photo of this.

125
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,780
I'll take the photo for real
if you keep crying.

126
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,540
Well.

127
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,020
Just pretend that I'm going on a vacation.

128
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,700
Anyway, I've never

129
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,180
taken a break for all these years.

130
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,890
From now on,

131
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,810
I can

132
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,920
wake up at any time

133
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,890
I want every day.

134
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,400
I can eat whatever I like.

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,380
I won't have to socialise anymore.

136
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,700
Well,

137
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,180
are you envious of me?

138
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,750
Miss Ye, since you're going on a vacation,

139
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,740
just get a good rest.

140
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,980
The company,

141
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,620
we brothers and sisters

142
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,660
will keep on working hard.

143
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,860
Fight on, Miss Ye.

144
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,220
Miss Ye, can we take a photo

145
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,540
with you at last?

146
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,900
Of course we can take a photo together.

147
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,390
Then, let's take a photo with Miss Ye.

148
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,860
Come.

149
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,260
I want to see you smile.

150
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,100
Three, two, one.

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,180
You're really going to resign?

152
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,770
Sit.

153
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,860
The editor-in-chief told me

154
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,340
that you're handing over your job to him.

155
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,940
Yes.

156
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,900
For the company's business,

157
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,170
I already have it arranged.

158
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,140
Everything has

159
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,460
its person-in-charge respectively.

160
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,780
Are you protesting against me?

161
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,400
Is it because

162
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,330
I didn't let you have that day off?

163
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,140
I'll give you the day off now.

164
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,500
I'm not protesting against you.

165
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,520
I just think it's not suitable

166
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,090
for us to work together now.

167
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,250
Why is it not suitable?

168
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,660
I think it's suitable.

169
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,600
The company's business

170
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
is all on track now.

171
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,800
Every position

172
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,740
has its person-in-charge.

173
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,580
Don't worry.

174
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,060
It won't cause major problems.

175
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,910

I always have high hopes for you.

that we can't choose

348
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,260
our parents, right?

349
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
So,

350
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,710
let's just be down to earth

351
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,860
and live our own lives.

352
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,020
Do something that we like

353
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
and

354
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,380
enjoy the lives we have now.

355
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,780
This is the meaning of a life.

356
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,900
What we should do now is

357
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,020
to go to sleep.

358
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,180
Have you figured it out?

359
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,700
Go back to your room if you do.

360
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,920
Goodnight.

361
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,420
Goodnight.

362
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,900
Goodnight.

363
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,020
Goodnight.

364
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,260
[Have you figured it out today? If yes,
call me. If no, buy an ice cream to eat.]

365
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,140
Why are you still up at this late hour?

366
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,100
Xiao Wudi,

367
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,250
my mum said

368
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,620
we create our own lives.

369
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,430
Somehow, there are arrangements

370
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,490
in each person's life.

371
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,140
As long as you try your best

372
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,450
to do your favourite things,

373
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,180
you'll be able to find
the meaning of your life.

374
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,780
Or I can ask my mum to talk to you.

375
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,030
She's good at comforting people.

376
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,740
Stop messing around.

377
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,380
Have you lost your weight?

378
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,420
No.

379
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,860
Though you're confused,

380
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,900
you should also take care of yourself.

381
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,580
You should eat well

382
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,180
and have a proper sleep.

383
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Or else,

384
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,210
you'll starve to death when you figure out

385
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,720
the meaning of your life.

386
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,780
What's the point of that?

387
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,250
My body is protected by magical power.

388
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,820
I won't die.

389
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,940
You can't do that even so.

390
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,300
My wish

391
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,540
is to get a charming boyfriend.

392
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,260
If your face is distorted,

393
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,780
I'll return you to the fairy.

394
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,140
You're pushing your luck, aren't you?

395
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,660
Do you really think that I look handsome?

396
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,890
So what?

397
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,740
You're ruined.

398
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,890
What do you mean?

399
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,740
Look at you.

400
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,180
You look more handsome than the others.

401
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,700
And you're smarter than regular people.

402
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,980
You're good at martial arts

403
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,900
and you're knowledgeable.

404
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,500
You always succeed

405
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,980
in doing the things you want.

406
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,780
If even a person like you

407
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,300
can't find the meaning of your life,

408
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,340
what are the ordinary people

409
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,540
like us going to do?

410
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,340
What's the point?

411
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,980
I'm a created character.

412
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,340
What's the difference between you and us?

413
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,660
Isn't this flesh?

414
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,580
Do you still remember

415
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,620
how you looked when you were a kid?

416
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,860
I remember it.

417
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,700
I've never

418
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,220
thought about this before.

419
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,180
But I've been working hard

420
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,940
to figure it out these two days.

421
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,360
I realised that I can't remember

422
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,700
any of this.

423
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,900
Do you get it now?

424
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,420
I'm the only one

425
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,460
who can solve my own problem.

426
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,080
You don't have to think too much.

427
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,060
It's merely a burden for you.

428
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,500
Rest assured, don't worry about me.

429
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,740
Go to sleep.

430
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,020
Goodnight.

431
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,180
Xiao Wudi,

432
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,300
I'll be responsible to you.

433
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,940
Sure.

434
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,260
Then, you can't lie to me.

435
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,740
Why would I lie to you?

436
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,460
Just you wait.

437
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,140
Goodnight.

438
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,140
Goodnight.

439
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,220
So this is how you go

440
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,300
to work everyday?

441
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,420
Ye Qing resigned.

442
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,860
It's not like the sky has collapsed.

443
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,070
I'll send

444
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,260
someone over to manage your company.

445
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,180
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

446
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,180
But speaking of which,

447
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,660
you're a boss.

448
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,380
with the unkempt look of yours,

449
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,500
how are you going to face your employees?

450
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,320
How can you reassure

451
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,620
your shareholders?

452
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,580
Come.

453
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,460
Since you

454
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,860
don't have faith in me,

455
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,460
then why did you support me back then?

456
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,980
To be honest with you,

457
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,440
I never thought of supporting you

458
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,300
back then.

459
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,240
That

460
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,780
ridiculous plan of yours,

461
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,810
who would expect it

462
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,860
to work?

463
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
If Ye Qing didn't come

464
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,500
to me with the proposal,

465
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,860
how would I transfer

466
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,300
the money to you so soon?

467
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,010
Hence,

468
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,580
the person I had faith in was Ye Qing,

469
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,540
not you.

470
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,880
What proposal?

471
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,060
She met you in private?

472
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,280
I thought she was

473
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,980
a young lady

474
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,220
who tried to

475
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,740
take the opportunity to get ahead.

476
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,000
So I dictated

477
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,880
some terms to her,

478
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,260
trying to make her give up.

479
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,140
I didn't expect her to say yes.

480
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,160
She actually did it.

481
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,980
What did she promise you?

482
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,340
She promised me that she won't date you.

483
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,020
Or I'll withdraw

484
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,060
my investment.

485
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,530
You really said that?

486
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,740
For real.

487
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,940
You seriously said that?

488
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,820
Yes.

489
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,340
I was just trying to scare her.

490
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,800
I didn't expect her to be so determined.

491
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,340
She's more determined than you.

492
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,380
Just come home.

493
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,300
Get familiar

494
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,060
with the company's business
and environment.

495
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,220
I told you

496
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
that I'm going to retire.

497
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,080
I will

498
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,600
pay you back every cent.

499
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,140
Don't ever think of
controlling my company.

500
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,140
I'll never let you control my life.

501
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,660
Can you really do it?

502
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,730
If you're so determined,

503
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,740
don't use the cash flow of the company.

504
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,330
It'll be a large amount of money

505
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,420
if the shares

506
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,980
are converted into cash.

507
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
I'm sure no one

508
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,260
in this city

509
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,820
would dare to take over this company.

510
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,860
It's a deal.

511
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,180
Brat.

512
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,770
Look, mum.

513
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,180
I didn't forget the skill.

514
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,340
Not bad.

515
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,860
You're fast.

516
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,720
[Lu Zichen]

517
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,860
Why didn't you answer it?

518
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,340
It's an advertisement. Just ignore it.

519
