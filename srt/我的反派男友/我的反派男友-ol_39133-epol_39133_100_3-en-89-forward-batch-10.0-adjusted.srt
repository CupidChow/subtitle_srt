No need for that.

115

Did you steal my keys again?

Do you expect me to wait for you

143

Were you hurt?

145

Lowly thugs like them

146
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,020
can never hurt me.

147

I'm glad to hear that.

148
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,380
Where did you go after that?

149
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,780
I went back to the mall
to retrieve my stuff.

150
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,290
This is a warning.

151
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,560
You better pick an appropriate time

152

if you plan to summon me next time.

153
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,670
You won't be able to afford them

154
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,550
if I lose them.

155
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,530
Did you rob a bank?

156
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,150
Are you sure you only pawned
your jade pendant

157
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,080
and didn't rob a bank?

158
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,350
Although I don't mind

159
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,980
messing with the cops here,

160
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,330
I won't attract their attention

161
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,460
under such circumstances

162
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,850
unless it's necessary.

163
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,230
After all,

164
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,860
I don't have

165
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,330
a legal identity in this era yet.

166
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,330
Great. You had me for a moment there.

167
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,110
If so...

168
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,950
Are you trying

169
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,250
to ask me why I appeared

170
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,640
and saved you again?

171
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,780
Let me be clear with you.

172
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,640
I wasn't trying to save you.

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,160
I was just keeping an eye on my hostage.

174
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,460
Besides,

175
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,640
when it comes to double-crossing people,

176
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,900

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,070
who can double-cross other people.

178
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,470
So, it was me

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,070
who summoned you again?

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,920
I remember I told you this before.

181
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,680
I heard your voice

182
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,070
before I was summoned by you.

183
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,420
[Someone, help me.
Stop showing off your relationship.]

184
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,060
[Can someone help me out?]

185
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,000
[Help!]

186
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,100
I heard your voice again this time.

187
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,260
But what's the connection
between the two incidents?

188
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,790
Although the words you said

189
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,200
weren't related,

190
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,300
both situations

191
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,630
were pretty similar.

192
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,630
It happens

193
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,480
whenever you need a hero

194
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,860
to save you.

195
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,880
A hero?

196
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,070
You don't say?

197
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,040
Do you think you can escape unscathed

198
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,920
in both situations

199
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,050
without any help?

200
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,750
[He's the person]

201
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,480
[the fairy had sent to save me.]

202
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,900
[If so, that means]

203
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,100
[I can do whatever I want in the future.]

204
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,470
[I just need to summon him]

205
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,110
[during crucial moments.]

206
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,950
Let me warn you.

207
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,230
You're not allowed

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,460
to get into any trouble in the future.

209
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,390
What trouble can I get into?

210
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,690
With a brain like yours,

211
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,450
I wouldn't be surprised

212
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,780
if you get into trouble.

213
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,590
Anyway, I've made myself clear.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,070
If you summon me again,

215
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,030
I will never help you out

216
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,690
no matter what happens to you.

217
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,760
And, if you keep

218
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,230
getting into trouble,

219
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,220
I have no choice

220
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,880
but to deal with
a troublemaker like you first.

221
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Time to sleep.

222
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,560
Wait!

223
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,450
What's wrong again?

224
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,320
Cut to the chase.

225
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,480
I will definitely regret this.

226
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,160
Come with me.

227
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,460
Come on.

228
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,410
Come in.

229
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,520
Whose house is this?

230
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,240
Of course it's mine.

231
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,940
Let me make things clear.

232
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,150
This is only

233
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
a temporary shelter for you.

234
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,980
I won't charge you any rent for now.

235
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
But only

236
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,170
if you agree to one condition.

237
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,930
What condition?

238
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,080
You cannot

239
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,720
come to find me whenever you like it,

240
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,380
especially

241
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,830
when my mother is around.

242
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,870
If not, I won't be able to explain myself

243
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,330
when she sees us together.

244
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
Are you saying

245
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,060
that I need to consider your feelings

246
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,990
and not create any trouble for you?

247
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,380
That's right.

248
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,070
But why must I

249
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,640
consider your feelings?

250
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,510
You!

251
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,290
Did you forget your status?

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,120
You're a hostage.

253
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm the one who's keeping you hostage.

254
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,880
You don't want your mother
to see me? Fine.

255
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,920
You have to give me something in return.

256
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,930
You're

257
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,200
rotten to the core.

258
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,730
You don't like it?

259
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,730
I can move back to your unit anytime.

260
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,930
Your bed is pretty comfortable anyway.

261
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,980
Wait a minute!

262
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,210
Tell me then.

263
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,390
What do you want?

264
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,410
I need

265
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,710
a smartphone.

266
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,540
You actually know what a smartphone is?

267
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,300
A smartphone

268
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,400
is just like a personal computer.

269
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,290
It has an independent operating space

270
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,510
and its own programs.

271
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,520
Its user can install

272
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,500
software, games, navigation apps,

273
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,550
and all kinds of programs offered by

274
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,430
third-party service providers.

275
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,290
It's a collective term for phones

276
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,790
that can connect to
the Internet wirelessly

277
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,250
through a mobile network.

278
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:49,920
You...

279
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,740
There's no need to be surprised.

280
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,400
I have a photographic memory.

281
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,140
I think I have

282
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,520
a spare smartphone...

283
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,490
For the time being,

284
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,960
I need to study

285
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,550
how to return to the ancient era.

286
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,770
The information I can get online

287
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,950
is way more than
what I can get from the library.

288
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,380
And, they're updated at a rapid pace.

289
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,430
So, do not bother me

290
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,690
for the time being.

291
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,940
Logically speaking,

292
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,510
you should be responsible

293
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,390
for providing me with

294
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,990
my meals and accommodation.

295
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,780
However,

296
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,130
given to your careless character,

297
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,810
you just need to deliver
three meals per day to me

298
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,900
on time.

299
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't have that kind of money.

300
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,400
Tell me when you're out of cash.

301
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,490
This is a lot.

302
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,210
Tonight,

303
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,550
move all my belongings

304
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,610
to the living room.

305
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,360
Do not interrupt my sleep.

306
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,990
But you...

307
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,350
I'm going to sleep now.

308
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,240
Care to join me?

309
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,180
Nope.

310
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,150
Wait.

311
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,320
Why are you afraid of fire?

312
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,760
When I was in middle school,

313
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,130
I was trapped in a fire.

314
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,370
Since then,

315
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,840
I've been traumatized.

316
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,490
When I see fire,

317
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,260
I'll panic and lose control.

318
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,400
The doctor said

319
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,160
it was a type of mental disorder.

320
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,250
Although it's been many years,

321
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,450
I'll suffer a relapse from time to time.

322
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,760
So, even the current doctors
couldn't treat your condition?

323
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,400
The doctor said

324
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,290
the doer needs to undo what he has done.

325
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,859
However, those people

326
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,160
are already gone.

327
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,770
However,

328
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,450
I'll be fine if I don't see any fire

329
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,920
when I'm panicking.

330
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,430
For example,

331
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,650
I'll skip the candles during my birthday.

332
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,610
I'll skip the fireworks

333
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,750
and avoid using gas to cook in the house.

334
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,280
As long as

335
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,300
I can avoid them,

336
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,060
I'll be fine.

337
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,910
I found out another of your weakness now.

338
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,150
[I said you would be recruited.]

339
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,830
When did you say that?

340
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,920
[Didn't I always]

341
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,800
[say that?]

342
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,430
[Our Nan Xing is the best,]

343
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,240
[right?]

344
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,550
[If only I were there.]

345
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,950
[We could've celebrated the occasion.]

346
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,340
[I think I'll perform
the day after tomorrow.]

347
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,430
[It'll be over in two days.]

348
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,090

00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,610
I'll resume my work now.

524
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,500
You're Nan Xing, right?

525
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,500
Come with me.

526
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:06,900
Come on.

527
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,030
It's not like I'll eat you alive.

528
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,560
Go now.

529
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,550
[Ye]

530
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,020
Come in.

531
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,340
Have a seat.

532
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,550
You didn't graduate from
the required course,

533
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,480
and you had no previous
working experiences, right?

534
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,680
However, you're an avid reader
of Lu Zichen's works.

535
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,160
I've read your resume

536
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,500
and the records of your job interview.

537
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,240
Actually, you don't have

538
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,230
the requirements

539
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,090
to be the president's assistant.

540
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
However, I still

541
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,530
allowed them to recruit you.

542
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,390
Do you know why?

543
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,210
It's because you said

544
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,530
you won't forsake your chance or give up.

545
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,850
I was an athlete.

546
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,620
My career as an athlete had taught me

547
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,600
not to give up until victory is achieved.

548
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
I won't forsake my chance or give up.

549
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,240
If you can

550
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,450
truly achieve that,

551
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,650
I believe

552
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,740
that you're qualified for the job.

553
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,630
Can you do it?

554
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,830
You can talk, right?

555
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,620
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,950
I'm just a bit nervous.

557
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,590
You're this nervous

558
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,680
when you're facing me?

559
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,190
How can you face Lu Zichen then?

560
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,660
How can you work as his assistant?

561
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,630
Being the boss's assistant

562
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,390
is the best position
for you to pick up new skills.

563
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,700
If you're willing to work hard,

564
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,360
you'll be able to grow quickly.

565
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,020
I was his assistant back then.

566
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,300
I know that.

567
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,450
I saw those articles online...

568
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,540
Most gossips you see online

569
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,330
were true,

570
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,050
except for

571
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,940
the one where they said
we had a relationship.

572
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,540
[So, she reads them too?]

573
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,810
But of course,

574
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,570
he's the largest asset of the company.

575
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,170
That's why it's part of my job

576
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,050
to be concerned about
the public's opinion of him.

577
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,580
I was his assistant for a decade.

578
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,350
Today, I wish to impart

579
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,400
the burden to you.

580
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,240
Is that okay?

581
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,480
I think so.

582
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,020
You face the highest possibility
of being fired

583
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,490
as the president's assistant.

584
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,370
Even if you fail,

585
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,830
it's not that big of a deal.

586
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,570
And, you've already joined our company.

587
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,370
I guess you've fulfilled your wish
of meeting your idol.

588
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,380
The result isn't important.

589
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,510
You should enjoy the process instead.

590
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,970
You may resume your work.

591
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,180
[Ye]

592
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,100
[I'll do the same thing this year.]

593
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,670
[I'll teach you how to skate on ice.]

594
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,730
[Happy birthday.]

595
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,670
Miss Jiao.

596
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,540
I'll head there first.

597
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,600
I'll be there soon.

598
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,440
Miss Jiao,

599
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,740
is that flower

600
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,410
a gift from my colleagues?

601
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,430
I think

602
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,070
the previous assistant
forgot to bring it with her

603
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,750
when she left the company.

604
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,520
It's still pretty fresh.

605
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,140
You face the highest possibility
of being fired

606
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,870
as the president's assistant.

607
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,250
Miss Jiao,

608
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,320
does our boss have a fierce temper?

609
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,220
Did Miss Ye tell you that?

610
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,970
You don't need to worry.

611
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,680
Our boss is a cultured person.

612
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,350
He never reprimands anyone.

613
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,190
Yeah.

614
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,080
That's how I felt about him

615
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,750
when I saw him

616
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,800
during a signing session.

617
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,570
Usually, he'll fire the person immediately

618
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,120
if he's unhappy with him.

619
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,130
He won't reprimand or scold you.

620
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,240
You don't need to be too nervous.

621
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,290
Our boss

622
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,660
doesn't appear in the company usually.

623
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,990
Usually, he stays at home

624
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,910
to write his scripts.

625
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,970
Sometimes, he'll come to the company

626
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,270
for a meeting or something.

627
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,240
That means

628
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,590
he doesn't appear in the company often.

629
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,300
However, that also means

630
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,900
that he might appear
in the company at any time.

631
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,480
If so, what do I need to prepare?

632
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,570
You don't need to make any preparations.

633
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,290
-You just need to be mentally prepared.
-Miss Jiao.

634
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,010
Everyone is here.

635
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,470
Coming.

636
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,600
I'll head to the meeting first.

637
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,000
You may resume your work.

638
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,680
Yufan,

639
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,300
I forgot to bring my mug today.

640
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,160
Are there

641
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,210
any extra mugs in the company?

642
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,430
Can I borrow one?

643
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,870
Don't tell me you didn't

644
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,800
take a single sip from morning until now?

645
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,390
Aren't you thirsty

646
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,490
when you haven't
taken a sip the entire day?

647
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,090
Follow me.

648
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,090
What's going on?

649
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,080
These are

650
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,670
the spare mugs.

651
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,320
You can use them.

652
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,790
Wash it after using it.

653
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,460
After that, put it back.

654
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,590
Alright, thank you.

655
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,040
Say,

656
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,180
should we bring Nan Xing

657
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,620
to the newcomer party tonight?

658
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,330
Did you forget about

659
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,990
all the previous assistants?

660
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,190
They were fired right after the party.

661
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,540
It was awkward.

662
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,060
I think Yufan has a point.

663
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,410
Let's go. Stop staring at her.

664
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,380
Guys, work time's over.

665
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,740
I'll make a move first.

666
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,790
Nan Xing, see you around.
Go back early, okay?

667
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,390
Miss Jiao!

668
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,850
So,

669
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,700
what are my tasks

670
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,790
for tomorrow?

671
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,680
Tomorrow?

672
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,530
Chu,

673
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,460
if you have anything

674
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,120
you need to print tomorrow...

675
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,400
Sure!

676
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,210
I'll get off work then.

677
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,720
Goodbye.

678
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,430
Okay, goodbye.

679
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,650
Goodbye.

680
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,160
Goodbye, Nan Xing.

681
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,710
Goodbye.

682
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,820
Yufan, goodbye.

683
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,570
Nan Xing?

684
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,590
What's wrong?

685
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,260
Are you upset on your first day of work?

686
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
That's not it.

687
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,920
Nan Xing, don't overthink it.

688
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,450
It's your first day of work.

689
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,030
You should celebrate
this occasion with a friend.

690
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,620
Yeah.

691
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,790
Don't be upset.

692
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,260
By the way,

693
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,150
we have plenty of books
to transport tomorrow.

694
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,370
Can you help us out?

695
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,800
Of course. No problem.

696
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,350
Really?

697
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,520
Thank you so much.

698
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,580
Nan Xing, we'll make a move first.

699
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:13,910
Okay.

700
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,800
Don't be upset.

701
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,470
Got it.

702
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,270
You can do it!

703
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:16,940
Goodbye.

704
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,060
Celebrate this occasion with my friends?

705
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,530
Fine.

706
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,199
Who should I find?

707
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,190
Since Aunt An isn't around...

708
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,989
Xiong Sisi.

709
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,870
Hello, Sisi?

710
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,010
[Hello, Xing?]

711
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,100
[Today's your first day of work.]

712
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,070
[How did you feel?]

713
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,159
Were you excited

714
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,750
when you saw your idol?

715
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,310
I didn't get to see him.

716
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,310
The boss wasn't around today.

717
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,190
[I heard that he doesn't
appear in the company often.]

718
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,770
[You had no idea.]

719
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,030
[I was so nervous today.]

720
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,710
I didn't even know

721
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,800
what I should do.

722
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,179
Oh yeah,

723
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,530
since today's my first day of work,

724
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,239
do you want to come out

725
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,239
and celebrate the occasion with me?

726
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
[Tonight? I can't make it tonight.]

727
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,040
It's all Hao's fault.

728
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,760
He just had

729
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,469
to accept

730
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,880
our coach's special training tonight.

731
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,080
Sorry, Xing.

732
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,090
Sorry for not being there with you.

733
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,980
[Why don't we celebrate it tomorrow?]

734
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,580
It's okay.

735
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,790
It's fine. Go ahead.

736
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,980
It's decided then.

737
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,320
Xing, I'll hang up now.

738
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,570
I'm happy for you.

739
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,500
Good luck!

740
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,010
Alright, got it.

741
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,940
Goodbye.

742
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,980
[Goodbye.]

743
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,590
Keep your water bottle.

744
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,950
Sisi is busy too.

745
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,090
Who else can I find?

746
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,820
Xiao Wudi?

747
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,470
No way.

748
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,480
Definitely not him.

749
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,570
I think I should celebrate this myself.

750
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,080
[So, even Stephen Hawking thinks]

751
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,060
[that time travel is impossible.]

752
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,250
[If so, how can I return to my era?]

753
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,520
[Don't tell me I have to stay here]

754
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,580
[and be the bodyguard of that dummy?]

755
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,110
Why isn't my dinner here yet?

756
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,500
Could it be

757
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,310
that she forgot to order it for me?

758
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,440
One Stir-Fried Glutinous Rice Balls,

759
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
one Fish in Sour Soup,

760
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,290
and one Stir-Fried Snow Peas
with Preserved Sausage.

761
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,420
For how many people?

762
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,890
For me alone.

763
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,440
Can you finish them?

764
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,750
Yeah.

765
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,750
Give me one steamed egg,

766
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,720
one Crucian Carp Tofu Soup,

767
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,920
and one Chinese Cucumber Salad.

768
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,580
That's all.

769
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,890
Are you sure you can finish them?

770
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,490
I'll bring them back home
if I can't finish them,

771
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,040
mister.

772
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,270
Give me a second.

773
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,900
Hello.

774
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,210
Here.

775
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,870
Here, let's have a toast.

776
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,620
Thank you.

777
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,840
This is our signature dish.

778
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
You'll feel happy

779
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,090
when you try it.

780
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,300
Enjoy your meal.

781
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,090
Thanks.

782
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
It's pretty good.

783
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,150
Try this.

784
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:01,910
Okay.

785
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,640
Okay.

786
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,950
Today,

787
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,550
I've worked as his assistant.

788
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,300
I guess

789
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,760
I've realized my dream.

790
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,410
I'm already doing great.

791
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,590
Don't overthink it.

792
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,530
From tomorrow onward,

793
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,160
I need to be more proactive.

794
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,750
She didn't order food for me?
Fine, I'll dine outside.

795
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,640
What if I'm still nervous tomorrow?

796
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,840
What should I do then?

797
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,430
You got something on your lips.

798
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,440
Help.

799
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,380
You got some on your lips too.

800
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,390
When will

801
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,150
someone wipe my mouth for me?

802
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,840
I wonder how it feels like?

803
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,320
[Help.]

804
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,870
[When will]

805
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,730
[someone wipe my mouth for me?]

806
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,980
[I wonder how it feels like?]

807
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,690
Did I summon you again?

808
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,240
When will

809
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,470
someone wipe my mouth for me?

810
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
I wonder how it feels like?

811
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,910
Did you hear that as well?

812
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,460
Is that even considered trouble?

813
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,940
There's just no one
to wipe your mouth for you.

814
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,750
Lower your volume!

815
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,890
I already told you before.

816
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,900
Next time,

817
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,120
I will never help you out

818
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,630
no matter

819
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,010
the reason you summon me,

820
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,270
let alone for a trivial matter like this.

821
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,180
What's wrong with wiping my mouth for me?

822
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,030
I just wanted someone
to wipe my mouth for me.

823
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,870
[When will]

824
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,650
[someone wipe my mouth for me?]

825
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,490
[I wonder how it feels like?]

826
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,140
Xiao Wudi?

827
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,680
Look at him. What's wrong with him?

828
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,030
Are you okay?

829
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,530
What's the matter?

830
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,010
There are so many people around!

831
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:16,940
Let go of me!

832
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,080
Hurry!

833
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,040
Don't wipe my mouth!

834
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,370
I don't need you to do it!

835
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,650
Are you happy now?

836
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,120
What have I done to deserve this?

837
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,770
Xiao Wudi, you!

838
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,610
You must be out of your mind!

839
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,850
What an ingrate.

840
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,840
He teleported to the restaurant

841
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,560
and started

842
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,460
wiping my mouth out of the blue.

843
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,810
And, I even had to apologize to him.

844
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,290
I'm such a dummy.

845
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,640
[She first summoned me]

846
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,440
[when she was stuck on the road.]

847
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,810
[She summoned me for the second time
when she was in danger.]

848
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,040
[But she summoned me for the third time
when she was having a meal.]

849
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,500
[If I didn't help her out,]

850
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,640
[my head would hurt,]

851
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,370
[as if someone was chanting
the Tight Hoop Curse.]

852
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,840
[This is so bizarre.]

853
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,690
[I'm sure there's a pattern]

854
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,350
[that I'm not noticing here.]

855
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,970
[Maybe]

856
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,320
[she was lying to me all along.]

857
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,410
What kind of stupid fairy is this?

858
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,510
Why did she send a devil to aid me?

859
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,670
Not only is he sponging off me,

860
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
but I also have to endure his temper.

861
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,480
How can I live in peace in the future?

862
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,140
That hurts!

863
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,110
I don't even

864
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,090
have a shoulder

865
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,560
to depend on.

866
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,460
Someone, help me out. I'm so pitiful.

867
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,210
You...

868
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,730
What did you hear again?

869
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,540
Don't resort to violence.

870
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,920
We can talk this over.

871
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,240
Don't kill me!

872
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,330
I won't think of anything else!

873
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,250
I'll stop thinking!

874
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,180
I'm begging you!

875
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,770
I'll obey your words!

876
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,280
I...
