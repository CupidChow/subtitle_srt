00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
I'm sorry.

00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,640
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,640
I'm sorry.

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,640
I'm sorry.

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

18
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,640
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm sorry.

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
I'm sorry.

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm sorry.

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm sorry.

34
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm sorry.

35
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm sorry.

36
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm sorry.

37
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm sorry.

38
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I'm sorry.

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm sorry.

42
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm sorry.

43
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
I'm sorry.

44
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm sorry.

45
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
I'm sorry.

46
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
I'm sorry.

47
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm sorry.

48
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm sorry.

49
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm sorry.

50
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm sorry.

51
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm sorry.

52
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm sorry.

53
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm sorry.

54
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm sorry.

55
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm sorry.

56
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm sorry.

57
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm sorry.

58
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm sorry.

59
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
I'm sorry.

60
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm sorry.

61
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Why are you...

90
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Your last name?

91
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
My last name is Nan.

92
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Nan Xin.

93
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Nan Xin.

94
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
You're the Nan I'm looking for, right?

95
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
What Nan?

96
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
What does that mean?

97
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
You can't get my heart.

98
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
You can get my person, right?

99
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I...

100
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
You really don't want to?

101
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
What?

102
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Just think of it as

103
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I repay you for saving me.

104
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
No!

105
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
This guy must be talking nonsense again.

106
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
You think I'll be scared, right?

107
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
So what if you are?

108
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
As expected.

109
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
How did you get this IQ?

110
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm scared.

111
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Who are you talking about?

112
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
What's wrong with my IQ?

113
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
You've been stuck here for a long time?

114
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
No.

115
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Do you need help?

116
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
No, I can do it myself.

117
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
You really don't need it?

118
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Just stay away from me.

119
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Okay.

120
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll stand here and wait for you.

121
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Can you do me a favor?

122
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
What's wrong with you?

123
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
We're fighting.

124
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
You're making a fool of me.

125
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Shut up!

126
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
No, I don't know him.

127
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Beauty, can you do me a favor?

128
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Hello, can you wash my...

129
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
You...

130
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
You should have asked me to help you earlier.

131
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
You...

132
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I owe you money.

133
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Can you stop following me?

134
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Can you tell me?

135
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Tell you what?

136
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Tell me how you summoned me to this world.

137
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Summon?

138
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
World?

139
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Which spiritual soldier did you come from?

140
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
No wonder you're dressed like this.

141
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Now, this time is the 21st century.

142
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
The time I exist is the year of the Ming and Zheng De.

143
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
The time I exist is the year of the Ming and Zheng De.

144
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
The time I exist is the year of the Ming and Zheng De.

145
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
The time I exist is the year of the Ming and Zheng De.

146
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
The time I exist is the year of the Ming and Zheng De.

147
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
It's been like 500 years now.

148
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
In my era, everyone is dressed like this.

149
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Indeed, with your IQ,

150
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
you can't understand all of this.

151
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
So when I just asked you,

152
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
you were talking nonsense.

153
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You...

154
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
You said you're an ancient person.

155
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I know for people of this era,

156
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
space travel is still impossible,

157
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,320
But I'm an ancient person.

158
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
You're telling the truth.

159
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,720
I mean,

160
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
what does that have to do with me?

161
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
Because the one who summoned me

162
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,960
could be you.

163
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,640
Why?

164
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
Do you remember you said yesterday

165
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,160
you saw me in the water in your dream

166
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,520
and found me lying in your arms after you woke up?

167
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Who are you?

168
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Yeah.

169
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,480
I still can't figure it out.

170
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,600
That was the first time you summoned me.

171
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
The first time?

172
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
And the second time?

173
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,160
Didn't you suspect me

174
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,920
when I suddenly appeared behind you?

175
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I thought you were a stalker.

176
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,800
I was in the library for a second.

177
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,440
Then I arrived at the street.

178
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
That's why I summoned you.

179
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,560
How is that possible?

180
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,240
That's so illogical.

181
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Help.

182
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,560
Don't be a dog.

183
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,840
Help me.

184
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,600
You didn't say that.

185
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,120
How could you hear me?

186
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
Who are you?

187
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Don't come over.

188
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Tell me who you are.

189
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,640
Everyone in the martial arts world calls me Mr. He Huan.

190
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm Xiao Wu Di.

191
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,160
He's the devil who played with people's lives

192
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
and made them fight with each other.

193
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,720
He's Mr. He Huan.

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Come on.

195
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Smile for me.

196
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,280
Xiao Wu Di.

197
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,400
How did this happen?

198
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,960
Is it a wish?

199
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,200
But it's a wish.

200
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,760
What wish?

201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,200
Why did you follow me?

202
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
I thought I'd let you go.

203
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm Mr. He Huan.

204
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
I'm famous in the martial arts world.

205
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,520
How could you let me go?

206
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,960
Why do you have to pester me?

207
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,480
If you're an ancient man,

208
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
you should be happy.

209
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,320
We have good food and clothes here.

210
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,840
And medical equipment.

211
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,920
You can enjoy the modern life here.

212
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,520
I don't want to be here.

213
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I want to go back.

214
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,320
Then go back.

215
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
You summoned me.

216
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,280
How can I go back?

217
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm not that capable.

218
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,880
I know you're not.

219
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,480
So,

220
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,240
you must have made an accident.

221
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,880
Now think about it.

222
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,440
What happened last night?

223
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,040
Last night,

224
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,400
I just made a wish.

225
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,520
A wish?

226
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Did you make a wish

227
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,640
to be given to you by God?

228
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,440
You're not ashamed to say that.

229
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
You made a wish.

230
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Aren't you ashamed?

231
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,560
I didn't make a wish.

232
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I made a wish

233
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,240
to have a good interview today.

234
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,280
Then I met a couple.

235
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
They provoked me.

236
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Then I...

237
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,000
What's the big deal about love?

238
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,040
If I can fall in love,

239
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,160
I want to fall in love, too.

240
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,480
I want to have a love that's unforgettable.

241
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
What did you say?

242
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,760
I just said it.

243
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,880
What is it?

244
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
I forgot.

245
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
It's not important.

246
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
What's important is

247
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,200
my coin fell in.

248
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,280
Then I made a dream

249
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
after a lot of effort.

250
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,880
In the dream,

251
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,560
I saw you in the water.

252
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,680
When I woke up,

253
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,480
you appeared next to me.

254
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,960
This coin has been in my hand

255
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,520
since I woke up.

256
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,040
You said you saw me in the dream.

257
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,240
Yes.

258
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,120
How did you do it?

259
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Are you a hypnotist?

260
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,120
Yes.

261
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
A magician?

262
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Stop talking nonsense.

263
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
Come on.

264
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
What?

265
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
This tree...

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,600
Do it again.

267
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Send me back.

268
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm so tired.

269
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,080
I'll just play a scene with him.

270
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,640
Fairy.

271
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,080
If you really brought him here,

272
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
please take it back.

273
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
I can't afford this gift.

274
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,880
Please.

275
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,960
And then?

276
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
Throw it in.

277
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
It's precious.

278
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,160
I can't...

279
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,360
Look.

280
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,400
Nothing happened.

281
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,120
It has nothing to do with me.

282
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,080
It's time to have a dream.

283
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
How can I do it?

284
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,240
You can do it when you fall asleep.

285
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,600
It's not good for us.

286
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
We're lying here

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
and being seen by others.

288
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,960
Do you think we're playing a scene?

289
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,160
Do you want me to go back?

290
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Yes.

291
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,040
But how can I fall asleep so easily?

292
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I can't.

293
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
I can't.

294
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I can't.

295
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
I can't.

296
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I can't.

297
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
I can't.

298
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
I can't.

299
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I can't.

300
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
I can't.

301
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I can't.

302
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I can't.

303
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I can't.

304
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
I can't sleep,

305
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
not necessarily beautiful anymore.

306
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,720
If you can't fall asleep,

307
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
is it too perverted?

308
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,840
Gooseness and 84.

309
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,720
You will fall asleep

310
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,360
between those three Russia and China.

311
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,640
Don't worry.

312
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
Let the others come to you

313
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
Don't worry about me.

314
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,880
Go to bed.

315
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
Tianming

316
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
Xiao条

317
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,080
Where?

318
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Is this still the Fairyland?

319
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Why am I here?

320
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
The environment here is good.

321
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Uncle, why are you here?

322
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
Why can't I be here?

323
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
This is my fairyland.

324
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,120
Of course I'm here.

325
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Let's get to know each other.

326
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm the real fairy.

327
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
What did you do to me?

328
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm your fairy.

329
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,120
What did you do to me?

330
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Why am I here?

331
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Didn't you want a love

332
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
that's unforgettable?

333
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
I got you Xiao Wu Di.

334
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,320
Xiao Wu Di's unforgettable love?

335
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
Isn't he handsome?

336
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm going to...

337
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,920
You...

338
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
You...

339
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
You...

340
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,120
You're just being nice, right?

341
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,720
You're just being nice, right?

342
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,520
I'm so mad.

343
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I don't want to date Xiao Wu Di.

344
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
Xiao Wu Di?

345
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,320
What's wrong?

346
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
He's a good-looking man.

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
He's good-looking,

348
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,920
he's good at both civil and martial arts,

349
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
and he's talented.

350
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
He doesn't deserve a girl like you.

351
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,520
A young girl who's single.

352
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,120
He's a traitor.

353
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
I wrote it myself.

354
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,920
I don't know what he's like.

355
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
He's rich and evil.

356
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,520
I won't do it.

357
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm a bad person.

358
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
Do you want him?

359
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,720
He's a human.

360
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
Who hasn't got a flaw yet?

361
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,520
Right?

362
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
Please forgive me.

363
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,920
I don't want him.

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,520
I don't want him.

365
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,720
Take him back.

366
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
I can't.

367
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
My power is limited.

368
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,920
I can't do it.

369
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,320
Just let him live.

370
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
Why?

371
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm a good-looking man.

372
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
Why do I have so many things?

373
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,320
What should I do?

374
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Actually,

375
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,320
there's a good news.

376
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,120
Humans are very fragile.

377
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,920
They don't last long.

378
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,520
Humans are short.

379
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,320
How about this?

380
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,120
You have to endure it for your whole life.

381
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
I wish you a long life.

382
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Okay?

383
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
A long life?

384
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,120
Look.

385
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,920
You...

386
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
Is it meaningful?

387
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,920
I'm a fairy here.

388
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,320
Let me tell you.

389
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Xiao Wu Di

390
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,920
is the most suitable person for you in the world.

391
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Get along with him.

392
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
Cherish the time with him.

393
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
And you can't stay here.

394
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,320
Take this thing and go back.

395
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,920
The dream just now is real.

396
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
I don't want it.

397
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
I don't want it.

398
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I don't want it.

399
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,520
You're back.

400
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,520
Bai Xin.

401
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,120
What's wrong?

402
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,920
Are you okay?

403
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,120
You're not feverish, are you?

404
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,520
No.

405
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,720
You're not feverish.

406
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,320
You must have a cold.

407
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,520
No.

408
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm just a little tired

409
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
from the interview today.

410
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,720
Do you want to eat something?

411
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
I'll make you something.

412
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
No.

413
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,120
I want to sleep for a while.

414
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,920
Maybe the interview today is not going well.

415
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,120
Tomorrow, I'll go to the show with the dance team.

416
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,520
Do you want to go?

417
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,120
Go out for a walk.

418
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
I'm not going.

419
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,320
I don't want to go out recently.

420
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Okay.

421
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,320
Then you rest for a while.

422
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Have a good rest.

423
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,920
Okay.

424
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,720
Call me if you need me.

425
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,200
Here.

426
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,720
Let me call the phone.

427
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Take it easier.

428
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,120
Awesome.

429
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,820
When sink in the ring.

430
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,520
I'll be an environment-based get-away next time.

431
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,020
Your salary is too high.

432
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,320
chanting

433
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,720
Can't let you succeed.

434
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,120
You should be careful.

435
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,520
Ju Jingending is crazy.

436
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,640
She only needs toly

437
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
stay on minimum.

438
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,480
Work hard and concentrate Stan Feng and Bai Jing's job.

439
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,720
Get back.

440
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,200
Because who says

441
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,440
that I am not a girl?

442
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,020
I really have not been interested in women.

443
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,580
Master won't understand it.

444
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,980
Good.

445
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,880
You areTwo步門年畢

446
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,200
She will disappear.

447
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I'm at home.

448
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,000
No matter what,

449
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
he can't come to my house, right?

450
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,160
As long as I'm at home,

451
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm safe.

452
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm not going out.

453
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,120
I'm not going out.

454
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm not going out.

455
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,360
What destiny?

456
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I won't accept such a destiny.

457
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,320
Gu Ge

458
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Why am I sleeping on the floor?

459
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Why is he still here?

460
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Where did he come in from?

461
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Did he follow me all this time?

462
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
You're going to run away again?

463
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
How did this happen?

464
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,160
If you want to involve more people,

465
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,160
then please be quiet.

466
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
That, this, this...

467
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
This, this...

468
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
That...

469
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
I'm sorry about yesterday.

470
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I was in a rush and hurried back.

471
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I forgot you there.

472
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
My brain...

473
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
It's okay.

474
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I was with you yesterday.

475
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I didn't lose you.

476
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
You were with me?

477
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,160
This guy was pretending to sleep last night.

478
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Why did I write such a difficult letter to the villain?

479
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
You slept so well last night.

480
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
You must have been dreaming.

481
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
No.

482
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
No?

483
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm serious.

484
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
You can't tell the truth.

485
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,160
You're the love God gave me to the villain?

486
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
I have no choice.

487
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I can only wait.

488
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Before you send me back,

489
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I can only sleep with you every night.

490
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
No!

491
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
You're an ancient man.

492
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Ancient people pay attention to

493
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
the gender of the victims.

494
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Look at me.

495
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I look like an ancient man

496
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
who teaches etiquette.

497
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
You're different.

498
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I think you're kidnapping.

499
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
You or the one outside?

500
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
You choose.

501
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
You're into my mom?

502
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
I saw her last night.

503
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
But she didn't see me.

504
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
I can go out and say hello to her.

505
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
No.

506
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
It has nothing to do with her.

507
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Then be honest with me.

508
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Stop pretending.

509
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
You brought me to this world.

510
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,160
If I hurt anyone by accident,

511
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
I'll be blamed on you.

512
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Nanxing.

513
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Are you here?

514
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Breakfast is ready.

515
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Come out and eat.

516
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Lin Tang is calling you.

517
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
I'll go say hello.

518
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Don't go.

519
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I'll do whatever you say.

520
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm hungry.

521
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Nanxing.

522
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Okay.

523
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
What are you doing?

524
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Did you hear me?

525
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Let's eat.

526
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Mom.

527
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I heard someone talking.

528
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
No.

529
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm watching the video.

530
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
How is it?

531
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
How are you feeling?

532
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
You look much better.

533
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm feeling better.

534
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm relieved.

535
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I wanted to comfort you yesterday.

536
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
I didn't say anything when I saw you were in a bad mood.

537
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,160
I have a few minutes to talk to you.

538
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Mom, aren't you leaving?

539
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Right?

540
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
The car is waiting for you downstairs.

541
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
I'm leaving.

542
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Hurry up.

543
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
But I won't be back tonight.

544
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I have to tell you all these.

545
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
It's just about finding a job.

546
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Yes.

547
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
It's not a big deal.

548
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
When I was young,

549
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I couldn't find a job either.

550
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
Do you know?

551
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
You've told me hundreds of times.

552
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Let's go.

553
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Have you told me?

554
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Yes.

555
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I've told you many times.

556
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Remember what I told you.

557
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Close the window.

558
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Lock the door.

559
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Remember.

560
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I know.

561
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
What else?

562
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
And have breakfast.

563
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Have a good meal.

564
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Bye.

565
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Be careful.

566
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I want to have breakfast.

567
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,160
The results of this signing event are on the top.

568
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,160
This result is still a little bit far from our goal.

569
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
So in the next round of signing events,

570
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,160
the venue selection and the coordination of the venue,

571
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
we will think of another way.

572
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
By the way, there is another question.

573
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Because the boss is straightforward,

574
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,160
so he offended the fans of those little fresh meat.

575
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Teacher Lu,

576
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
we all know that your work has entered

577
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
the film adaptation and adaptation section.

578
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I heard that some of the popular little fresh meat

579
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
has entered our list of selectors.

580
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Is this true?

581
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Yes.

582
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
But I don't think they can act.

583
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Now the situation outside is still more serious.

584
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Jiao Jiao and I have also made some plans.

585
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
We want to discuss with you

586
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
how to deal with this problem.

587
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
No need to deal with it.

588
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Boss,

589
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,160
we are really not afraid of being scolded.

590
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
It's just that the general company they belong to

591
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,160
is very close to the investor we set up.

592
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
They are now

593
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
a little dissatisfied with your speech.

594
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
The business department is on alert.

595
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
There may be risk of withdrawal at any time.

596
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
It's okay.

597
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Fengsheng was originally released by them.

598
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
These people have a big difference

599
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
from Ma Leng's image.

600
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Based on protecting the work and protecting the character,

601
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
the boss's answer is no problem.

602
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Besides, the boss hasn't been approved yet.

603
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,160
They borrowed our output to make a stir.

604
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
We also have to consider

605
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
whether we should continue to cooperate with such an investor.

606
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Our company's goal this year

607
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,160
is still to select new authors.

608
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
The original intention of me and Ye Qing to start X Culture

609
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
is not to sell the copyright and make films,

610
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
but to give more young writers like me

611
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
a chance to write good works

612
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
and live a better life.

613
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
You continue.

614
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
That's it for today.

615
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Dismissed.

616
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Xiao Xiao.

617
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
How is the boss's recruitment?

618
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Pretty good.

619
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
HR just gave me some information.

620
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
They are all graduate from a famous university.

621
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
All aspects of quality are also okay.

622
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
The boss's assistant's list

623
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
is there a man called Nan Xing?

624
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Nan Xing doesn't seem to be here.

625
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Look for it.

626
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
I remember it's not here.

627
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
It's all here.

628
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Yes, it's not here.

629
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
It seems to be in the list of the cover.

630
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Show me his information.

631
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Dismissed.

632
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Dismissed.

633
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
I haven't found a job yet.

634
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Dismissed.

635
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I don't know if there's love.

636
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
But these are enough to be a star.

637
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Young Master Xiao, you only eat this little?

638
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Do you want to eat more?

639
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I got up in the morning.

640
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
I don't have any appetite.

641
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Then you let me order so much.

642
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Ten dishes less than breakfast.

643
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Is that a life for people?

644
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
If I knew it, I would have written you

645
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,160
as a little dog in a cage.

646
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
I can go out and get food.

647
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,160
I think you know the rules.

648
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I finished eating.

649
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
You can enjoy the leftovers.

650
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Are you treating me as a servant now?

651
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I don't take you as a servant.

652
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,160
You are not worthy of being my servant.

653
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
You are just my hostage.

654
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Do you know what hostage means?

655
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
I know.

656
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Don't eat.

657
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Clean up and come to me.

658
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
I'm looking for you.

659
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Where are you going?

660
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Where are you going?

661
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Bathing and changing clothes.

662
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Don't use other people's bathroom.

663
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
You don't know the current people's sense of humor.

664
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
What's so hard about it?

665
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
You'd better go out.

666
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Don't use this trick to scare me.

667
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Am I scaring you?

668
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Stop.

669
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Did I ask you to leave?

670
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
I found that your hot water toilet,

671
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
hot water machine, bath tub,

672
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
and bathtub are all in one set.

673
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Your generation

674
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
is better than the emperor of Ming Dynasty.

675
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
How do you know everything?

676
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm a man who has been to the library.

677
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
You went to the library

678
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
and you know everything?

679
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
I don't know everything.

680
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
For example, now,

681
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I have one thing that I don't understand.

682
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
What?

683
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Why are you still wearing an eye mask?

684
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Is it because I'm ugly

685
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,160
or because you don't dare to look?

686
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm not afraid to look.

687
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
What's there that I'm afraid to look at?

688
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm an adult woman.

689
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
What's there that I'm afraid to look at?

690
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
I'll show you now.

691
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
You're quite good at talking.

692
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
I've put on my clothes.

693
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Go out quickly.

694
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Thank you.

695
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Thank you.

696
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
It's okay.

697
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Big Wu Ji!

698
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
This is TV.

699
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
How can you not know yourself?

700
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I'm an ancient man, not an idiot.

701
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,160
This kind of trick can be studied.

702
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Yes, I'm the idiot now.

703
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Okay, come here.

704
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
What can I do?

705
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Why do you come here?

706
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Lin Tang should want to talk to me.

707
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Bring a pair of scissors.

708
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
When I go in later,

709
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,160
I'll go find some men's clothes.

710
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Why do you need scissors?

711
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Look at the situation now.

712
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I have to stay here for a few more days.

713
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I can't show off my face every day.

714
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
We don't have men's clothes.

715
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
There are only two men inside.

716
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
They're gone.

717
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Then you can think of a way to...

718
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Where can I think of a way for you?

719
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
If you can't think of a way,

720
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
then the consequences will be unbearable.

721
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
I'll think of a way for you.

722
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I have an idea.

723
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
After the case,

724
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Su Yu will sneak into the South East Sea for investigation.

725
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
He'll find the key clue at the bottom of the sea.

726
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
But he's in danger.

727
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Will Ma Lang save him?

728
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Of course.

729
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I've thought of a way to save him.

730
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
But there's a key problem.

731
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
I need to discuss it.

732
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
So I think tonight...

733
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Come in.

734
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Mr. Ye, boss.

735
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
I have a letter for you.

736
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
I'm free tonight.

737
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Let's have dinner and talk.

738
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Tomorrow, okay?

739
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
I have an appointment tonight.

740
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Okay.

741
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Wait.

742
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Mr. Ye, is it your birthday today?

743
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
Yes.

744
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Happy birthday, Mr. Ye.

745
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Thank you.

746
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
You're too much.

747
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,160
No one would invite someone to dinner on their birthday.

748
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
What?

749
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
You want to treat me to dinner too?

750
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
No, no.

751
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
That's not what I meant.

752
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Mr. Ye, you're busy. I'm going to work.

753
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Bye.

754
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Coming.

755
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Come.

756
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Si Si.

757
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I got your call.

758
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
I got a call from the shopkeeper.

759
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
How is it?

760
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Is it okay?

761
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Yes.

762
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
What are you doing?

763
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I need to go to the bathroom.

764
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm in a hurry.

765
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Go to McDonald's.

766
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
McDonald's?

767
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
I'm in the bathroom.

768
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
You want me to go to McDonald's?

769
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Our toilet is broken.

770
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Senior.

771
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
You're so bold.

772
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
That's the midnight snack I had yesterday.

773
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
I forgot to clean it up.

774
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm done.

775
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Where are my clothes?

776
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Go to McDonald's.

777
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Did I smell a sour porridge?

778
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Senior.

779
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Something's wrong.

780
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Are you done?

781
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,160
What clothes did you find for me?

782
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
If you want to wear an international brand,

783
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
you can tie it to a rich woman.

784
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Let me go.

785
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Okay?

786
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Come out.

787
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
You look like a primary school student.

788
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Is it funny?

789
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,160
You cut your hair well.

790
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
You're so natural.

791
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Let's go.

792
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Where?

793
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
To buy some normal clothes.

794
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
You have money.

795
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
I don't have money.

796
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
You have.

797
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
I don't have money.

798
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Kill me.

799
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Okay.

800
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Come on.

801
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Kill me.

802
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
I don't want to live.

803
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Let's do it.

804
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Let's do it.

805
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Brother, I'm kidding.

806
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Don't be so serious.

807
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Call.

808
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
I need to answer a call.

809
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Hello, uncle.

810
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Uncle, what's wrong?

811
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Nan Xing, are you free?

812
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
I need you to come to the police station

813
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
and point out the suspect.

814
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

815
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
I'm going out.

816
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Where?

817
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Public Security Bureau.

818
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Yaman.

819
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Liu Shanmen.

820
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
I know.

821
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
No need for you to explain.

822
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
You know everything.

823
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
You're really a man who has read books in the library.

824
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
You're great.

825
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
You're smart.

826
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,160
If I hurt anyone by accident,

827
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
it's all on you.

828
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Well,

829
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
can you promise me to stay at home

830
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
and not run around?

831
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Of course.

832
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
If I break into any trouble,

833
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
it's all on you.

834
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
It's good that you know.

835
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
I'll go.

836
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Stay at home.

837
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
I'll go.

838
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
You should be detained.

839
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
There's a criminal.

840
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
How do they know each other?

841
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Who is this man?

842
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Think about it again.

843
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Does he have any specific features?

844
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
He's not the one.

845
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
The tattoo on his hand

846
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
is different from that thief.

847
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Well,

848
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
come with me to the office

849
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
and make a comparison.

850
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Here's the thing.

851
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
This time,

852
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
we've got a robbery team.

853
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
But this robbery team...

854
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Lan Xin.

855
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Uncle.

856
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
Are you ready?

857
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Yes.

858
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Be careful.

859
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Okay.

860
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
This robbery team

861
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
actually has something to do with

862
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
the flying car robbery case

863
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
you suggested last time.

864
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Lan Xin.

865
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Have you found the murderer?

866
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Not yet.

867
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
If you need any help,

868
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
call me.

869
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
I'm leaving.

870
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Bye.

871
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Bye.

872
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Anyway,

873
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
we can't let these bad guys

874
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
get away with it easily.

875
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Besides,

876
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
I feel like

877
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
many people in our district

878
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
know you.

879
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
You just came here

880
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
and you don't know the situation.

881
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Lan Xin is amazing.

882
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
She helped us catch a lot of bad guys.

883
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
She's our criminal guest.

884
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Don't say that.

885
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Especially now.

886
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I can't tell.

887
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Come on.

888
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
This way, please.

889
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Sir.

890
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Do you need anything?

891
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Are you a waitress?

892
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Don't move.

893
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm sorry.

894
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
I'm sorry.

895
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
I'm sorry.

896
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm sorry.

897
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I'm sorry.

898
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
I'm sorry.

899
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
I'm sorry.

900
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm sorry.

901
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
I'm sorry.

902
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
I'm sorry.

903
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I'm sorry.

904
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm sorry.

905
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm sorry.

906
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm sorry.

907
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm sorry.

908
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm sorry.

909
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm sorry.

910
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm sorry.

911
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
I'm sorry.

912
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm sorry.

913
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm sorry.

914
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm sorry.

915
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
I'm sorry.

916
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm sorry.

917
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm sorry.

918
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I'm sorry.

919
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm sorry.

920
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
I'm sorry.

921
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Sir.

922
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Which one do you want?

923
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
All of them.

924
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Can he afford it?

925
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Count how much you need.

926
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
Sir, please wait.

927
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Hurry up.

928
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Get a cup of coffee for him.

929
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Money can make ghosts go down.

930
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
It's been 500 years.

931
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
The human heart has never changed.

932
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
I'm sorry.

933
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm sorry.

934
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
I'm sorry.

935
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm sorry.

936
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
I'm sorry.

937
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm sorry.

938
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
I'm sorry.

939
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
I'm sorry.

940
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
I'm sorry.

941
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I'm sorry.

942
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
I'm sorry.

943
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
I'm sorry.

944
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
I'm sorry.

945
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
I'm sorry.

946
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
I'm sorry.

947
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
I'm sorry.

948
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
I'm sorry.

949
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
I'm sorry.

950
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
I'm sorry.

951
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
I'm sorry.

952
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I'm sorry.

953
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
I'm sorry.

954
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm sorry.

955
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
I'm sorry.

956
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm sorry.

957
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
I'm sorry.

958
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
I'm sorry.

959
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
I'm sorry.

960
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
I'm sorry.

961
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm sorry.

962
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
I'm sorry.

963
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
I'm sorry.

964
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
I'm sorry.

965
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
I'm sorry.

966
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
I'm sorry.

967
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
I'm sorry.

968
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
I'm sorry.

969
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
I'm sorry.

970
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
I don't know if Xiao Wu Di

971
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
caused trouble for me at home.

972
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Since he came here,

973
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
I haven't met a good thing.

974
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
One day,

975
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
I'll be killed by him.

976
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Fairy, fairy.

977
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
You sent him to punish me, right?

978
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Hello?

979
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Who is it?

980
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Is it Nan Xing?

981
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Yes.

982
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Hello.

983
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
I'm HR of X Culture.

984
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Yesterday, you came to our company

985
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
to interview the assistant of the president, right?

986
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Yes.

987
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
I want to inform you that

988
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
congratulations on your admission.

989
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm sorry.

990
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
I'm so excited.

991
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
I thought I was being brushed off.

992
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
You are indeed admitted.

993
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,160
The detailed notice is in the email.

994
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
It's been sent to your mailbox.

995
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Okay.

996
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
Okay.

997
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Let me have a look.

998
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
I really got it.

999
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
If there's no problem,

1000
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
you can come to the company tomorrow.

1001
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Okay.

1002
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Thank you.

1003
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Really?

1004
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
X Culture.

1005
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Senior again.

1006
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Did he recognize me?

1007
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,160
Did he see me at the signing event?

1008
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
No, I can't do that.

1009
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Then others will think I went in through the back door.

1010
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Stop!

1011
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Stop!

1012
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Stop!

1013
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Don't come over.

1014
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Don't come over.

1015
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
I've called the police.

1016
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
Stop!

1017
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Call the police.

1018
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Call the police.

1019
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
Call the police.
