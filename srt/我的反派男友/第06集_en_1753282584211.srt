1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I guess the most touching story of myself

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is to meet you

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Before the promise, I abandoned the secret

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To call out my name

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In the distant space, I hear you here

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're destined to be with me

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Come to me, stay with me

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You are the past and the present

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The eternal destiny

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Come for me, stay with me

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Once you look back, you fill my heart

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh oh believe me

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you doing again?

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I promised you.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What did you promise me?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Didn't you like me?

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I promised to be friends with you.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You should have told me earlier that you liked me.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then I wouldn't have to think about Lu Zichen.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've already thought about it.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We'll be together on a public level.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then I'll leave you heartlessly.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In this way, you can say that you have

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A love that's hard to get.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then you're free.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I don't like you.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't like you.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I don't like you.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How is that possible?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't like you.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How is that possible?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I really don't like you.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then you...

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wait.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you confessing to me?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How could I confess to you?

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You were just confessing to me.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Wait.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me record it again.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've never been confessed to in my life.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I've never rejected anyone.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Say it again.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Get out.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What did you say?

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Say it again.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How could she not like me?

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's impossible.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It really wasn't me.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How could that be?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Impossible.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I need to confirm it.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Little Wu Di.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Little Wu Di.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Little Wu Di.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're so happy even in your dream.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And you're still pretending.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's see how I'll beat you tomorrow.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Little Wu Di.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Little Wu Di.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Take your money and go back to the ancient times.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What does my senior like about someone?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He sees handsome guys and talks to them.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But he doesn't care about them at all.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sometimes, he doesn't even dare to say anything.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sometimes, he even has a bad feeling.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But if you say he wants to be with someone,

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
he won't agree.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So I think he hasn't liked anyone these years.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've never seen him.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Then it's no help to me.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I haven't finished.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I haven't seen him.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But he once told me that he likes someone.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What kind of person?

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He's totally a bad person.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He's totally into you.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Into me?

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's totally into you.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He's happy when you're happy.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's even more sad when you're sad.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If he cries in front of you,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
he'll be even more miserable.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Into me?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't think too much.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's said that he likes that person for a few years.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But in the end, they're not together.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't let it affect your development because of me.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't worry.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I have a way.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This...

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Are you going to confess?

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Should I warn Senior Sister?

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Such a good opportunity.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have to record it in advance and keep the evidence.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Forget it.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I should be nervous to remind her.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mom.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're back.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're still practicing?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're done?

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I haven't cooked yet.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What did you eat?

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's my boss.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What about your boss?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He killed Su Yu.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He was arrested?

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Su Yu is the heroine of his childhood.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He killed him.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now the fans on Weibo have already blown up.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They're trending it to the 12th place.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let me see.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Lu Zichen, I've already turned against you.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The fans are black.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Lu Zichen, give me back my Su Yu.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Lu Zichen is black.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Lu Zichen, go to hell.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is too cruel.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hello, Jiaming.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have some work to do now.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't play with you today.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's okay.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How about I come up and stay with you?

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No need.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're here to affect my work.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't stay with you.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How about this?

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's call each other again tonight.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Get back to work.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Bye.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've thought about the way to save him.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But there's another key problem.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I think we need to discuss it again.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I think tonight...

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have an appointment with you tonight.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hello, Nanxing.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Go to Mr. Lu's house and bring his draft.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I used to go there.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I should give it to you now.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He's not angry because of this, right?

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mr. Ding.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We've looked everywhere.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We couldn't find anyone.

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He didn't answer the phone and didn't reply.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No one opened the door.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And the team and the colleagues told me

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that the boss told them

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that this article couldn't be shown to anyone

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
before the release.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What other people?

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's me.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go to work.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sorry.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to see you.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Coffee.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But I don't have time to accompany you now.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's okay.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hello.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes. How is it?

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sister Jiao.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hello, Nanxing.

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How is it going over there?

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you need me to help you?

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No need.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can't handle this kind of thing.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's right.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think I can only make trouble.

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Nanxing, I'll go to work first.

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay. See you tomorrow.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Bye.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why did you write Su Yu to death?

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Isn't that the type you like?

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Will you like someone and hope that he will die?

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Or will you destroy it if you can't get it?

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Come over now.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Drink with me.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's going on with him?

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Come in.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The door is not closed.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What's wrong with you?

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why did you start drinking in the daytime?

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What happened?

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Nothing.

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's okay. You can call me over.

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's really okay.

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Say it.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I suddenly don't want to be alone.

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why?

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Maybe it's because I'm watching TV.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I suddenly think of Hehuang Palace.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My hometown, Hehuang Palace.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I know. I wrote it.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You used to live in the palace?

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you the emperor or the eunuch?

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're not the emperor.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hehuang Palace is a famous martial arts school.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because I have no parents since I was a child.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So my master adopted me.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I lived in Hehuang Palace with him since I was a child.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He has a master?

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How come I don't know?

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But later, my master left.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He is my only family.

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
When he left, he told me that

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
he wanted me to wait for someone in the palace.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait for someone I want to protect for the rest of my life.

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
After he told me,

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I waited in the palace.

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Day after day, year after year.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But I didn't wait for him to show up.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
My master didn't have a sound.

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But I think it's good.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Really.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
At least at that time,

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I still have a family.

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then?

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then...

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When I got here,

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
everything was gone.

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you believe it?

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you sad?

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you sad?

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You should admit that you like me.

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm fine.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Sorry.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I miss home so much.

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's okay.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a coincidence.

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sad too.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll drink with you.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Wait a minute.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Then you...

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why are you sad?

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is it because of me?

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't...

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's all because of our boss.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He wrote Su Yu to death.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's Su Yu.

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I've liked Su Yu for ten years.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He wrote it to death.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Su Yu?

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wait.

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I just said so much.

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are you sad because of Su Yu?

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You don't know how important Su Yu is to me.

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's my whole youth.

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I grew up with Su Yu.

261
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I barely have friends in junior high and high school.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When I'm having a hard time,

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Su Yu is the only one to be with me.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Miss Wang!

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let us in!

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Let us in!

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Miss Wang!

268
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Calm down, everyone.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let us in!

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Excuse me.

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Back off!

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I won't back off!

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Wait.

274
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is the boss' delivery.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Take it to his office.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We'll wait for you.

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Give me back my daughter!

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Everyone, go back and wait for the same thing.

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay?

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Boss.

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're so stupid.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You wrote it to death.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
How can the reader calm down?

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Look at the mess outside.

286
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a sad thing.

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Don't they think it's normal to be sad?

288
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's such a big thing.

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Can't you tell me in advance

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
to get ready?

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Do I have to see it on Weibo?

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Creation is a private matter.

293
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Do I need to tell you in advance?

294
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why didn't you tell me before you fell in love?

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, that's why you're here.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Did I say that you can't fall in love in my labor contract?

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
At least, it's a waste of your work.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Think about it.

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If you come and get this draft,

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
we can communicate face to face.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's two different things.

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Men should do these things.

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not not your assistant because I'm in love.

306
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Forget it.

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The draft has been sent out anyway.

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,500
The

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Can't you write it if you can write it?

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's better than me.

311
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What do you mean?

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Write it.

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Wait.

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What are you doing here?

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I...

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Your express delivery.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Okay.

318
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,360
Okay, bye.

319
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,600
Sister.

320
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,760
This is my place.

321
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,780
Go!

322
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,440
Okay.

323
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,000
What's wrong, Mr. Bai?

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm going to divorce you.

325
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,040
Throw it away.

326
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't tell anyone.

327
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,240
But...

328
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
Throw it away.

329
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,120
Go.

330
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,840
Lan Xin, what's up?

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Please.

332
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
No worries.

333
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,360
Relax.

334
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,600
Boss.

335
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Boss.

336
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,440
I think you're doing this wis a bad thing.

337
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,600
You shouldn't

338
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,440
take your time to...

339
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,680
handle Your business.

340
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,120
Do you know as a chaos poet,

341
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,680
how much danger you'll face?

342
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,760
There are thousands of people cursing me.

343
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Do you think the police can catch you?

344
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,040
But he's different from those people on the Internet.

345
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,760
He's obviously imitating the murderous scenes in your book.

346
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,960
And he's already come to our company.

347
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,720
He might be following you.

348
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Do you know how much pressure our company is under on the Internet?

349
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,800
If this matter is found out in the police station,

350
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,080
and nothing happens, what should we do?

351
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,480
I've said that nothing will happen.

352
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,680
It will never happen.

353
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,760
Then we don't care?

354
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,400
How?

355
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,280
They just need to vent their emotions.

356
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,880
They won't do anything else.

357
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,960
But if...

358
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,240
If something really happens,

359
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,640
I don't think we need to call the police.

360
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,600
I've said that they won't do anything else.

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,520
I can't watch you in danger,

362
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,640
but I don't care about you.

363
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,520
No, I have to catch him.

364
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,560
How?

365
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,680
Can you catch him?

366
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,120
Are you trying to show yourself in front of me for the sake of turning over?

367
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,480
I'm not trying to turn over.

368
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,880
I'm doing this for your safety.

369
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,600
My safety is fine.

370
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
No, I have to catch him.

371
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Are you annoying?

372
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,880
You're...

373
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Boss,

374
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,800
are you trying to turn over for me

375
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,920
because you don't want to?

376
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,160
I don't want to?

377
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,520
Fine, if you catch him, I'll turn over for you.

378
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,040
It's a deal.

379
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,480
It's a deal.

380
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
What am I doing?

381
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Nan Xing.

382
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,360
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

383
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,680
You have a fever?

384
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,400
Why is your face so red?

385
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
It's nothing.

386
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Miss.

387
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I...

388
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,120
Can I...

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
go to the bathroom?

390
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,160
Why do you need to apply for this?

391
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
Just go.

392
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Thank you.

393
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Thank you.

394
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,800
I forgot.

395
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,200
I dare to stop my business.

396
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
What should I do?

397
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
How can I do such a thing?

398
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
No.

399
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,320
The most important thing now

400
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,280
is to find the criminal.

401
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Yes, find the criminal.

402
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,320
Time to kill him.

403
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,840
According to the letter in the book,

404
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
the criminal will come again tonight.

405
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,000
And he will put a blood stain on the door of the victim.

406
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,600
The third day, the victim will be found.

407
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
No.

408
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,040
I must stop this.

409
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,040
What should I do?

410
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
So I want to tell you that

411
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
you are not alone.

412
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm with you.

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
I'm your friend.

414
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,360
Hello.

415
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,160
Hello, young master.

416
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,120
What?

417
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Can you come to our company?

418
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I need your help.

419
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm busy.

420
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
You...

421
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,440
Little butterfly.

422
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,040
I need you now.

423
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,960
Help.

424
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Help me.

425
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,320
Help.

426
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
Help me.

427
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,400
You really come here?

428
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,920
Can you pick a place?

429
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I thought you were rude.

430
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Nanxing.

431
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Nanxing.

432
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,960
Nanxing, are you in there?

433
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Nanxing, are you in there?

434
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,880
Sister Jiao, what's up?

435
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
Nothing.

436
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,200
I saw you didn't come back for a long time.

437
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm worried that you are not feeling well.

438
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
Are you okay?

439
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I have a stomachache.

440
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,400
You have a stomachache? Is it serious?

441
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,800
I'm fine, sister Jiao. I'll be fine in a while.

442
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
That's good.

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,640
I'll go back first.

444
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,480
If you need anything, just message me.

445
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Okay.

446
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Let me down.

447
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
My legs are numb.

448
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
I really need to talk to you.

449
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Can you go out first?

450
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I...

451
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm dizzy.

452
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,400
So I'm sure that she will show up again tonight.

453
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,800
As long as we ambush her, we can definitely catch her.

454
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,200
Okay, okay. I know what you want to say.

455
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
You must say,

456
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
make your own position clear.

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
You are a hostage, I am a kidnapper.

458
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Believe it or not, I'll...

459
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,600
Okay, I'll help you.

460
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
You really agreed?

461
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,800
I'll find a place to wait for you to get off work.

462
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Then I'll treat you to dinner today.

463
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Treat me to dinner?

464
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
Do you have money?

465
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,000
Then I'll find you a good restaurant.

466
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You treat me.

467
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Hey.

468
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
You...

469
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Can you be quiet?

470
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,200
Can you be quiet?

471
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
What if she shows up now?

472
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
You said a bad person

473
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,400
came here every day after doing bad things,

474
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,600
waiting to be caught by you.

475
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
There's no logic at all.

476
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,200
Then why should I talk about logic when I'm a fan of the brain?

477
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
According to the situation in the book,

478
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
she should come here this time

479
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
to put on the raincoat of Dai Xue.

480
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So she will definitely show up.

481
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,400
How can you...

482
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm not going to talk anymore.

483
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Don't be so hasty.

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
What a mess.

485
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Hello, mom.

486
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,200
Nan, where are you?

487
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I forgot to tell you.

488
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm working overtime today.

489
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
You sleep first. Don't wait for me.

490
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,600
Are you with Xiong?

491
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm not with Xiong.

492
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,400
I see.

493
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,200
Don't be too late.

494
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Okay, I know. Bye.

495
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Bye.

496
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
You really want to work here?

497
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,200
Can't you change a place?

498
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
I told you I didn't want to change.

499
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,600
Why do you think so?

500
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay.

501
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,600
Even if you don't want to change,

502
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
this is just a job.

503
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
Is that necessary?

504
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Because this job is very important to me.

505
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,200
Do you remember

506
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,800
I told you before

507
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
that I had a big accident

508
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,400
when I was in middle school?

509
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Actually, during that time,

510
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,600
I felt very down.

511
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,400
I felt like I couldn't hold on anymore.

512
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,800
It was our boss's tree that saved me.

513
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,800
Didn't he write a book about retreating?

514
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,000
It can save people.

515
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Because he wrote very well.

516
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,800
So I kept chasing after him.

517
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,600
I didn't think about anything.

518
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Gradually,

519
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the difficult days

520
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,800
came to an end.

521
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,000
So I really appreciate him.

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
He not only wrote well,

523
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,200
but also a very great person with a dream.

524
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Not only did he succeed,

525
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,400
he also wanted to help more ideal writers.

526
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,400
He did a lot of things he should do,

527
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,000
but didn't make much money.

528
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
So I was thinking

529
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,600
that no matter I retired

530
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,800
or changed my career,

531
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,400
I would become someone like him.

532
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,200
Even if I just gave him a job,

533
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,000
it's worth dying for.

534
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,800
What job needs a dead person?

535
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,400
Look, isn't it dangerous today?

536
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,800
What if the other person has a weapon?

537
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked you to come.

538
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
Whether or not you have a weapon,

539
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,400
you can ask him.

540
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,000
Hey!

541
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Ah!

542
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't run!

543
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Ah!

544
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Xiao Di!

545
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Xiao Di!

546
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Xiao Di!

547
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,200
What's wrong?

548
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,800
Xiao Di!

549
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,400
Xiao Di!

550
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
This...

551
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,400
I brought a dagger.

553
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Don't talk.

554
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
I'll call an ambulance.

555
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,200
It's okay.

556
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Don't worry.

557
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
I can do it.

558
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,400
You can do it.

559
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Our medical technology is very advanced.

560
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
I'll give you all my blood.

561
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,800
Just don't fall asleep.

562
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Don't worry.

563
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,000
I may not be able to accompany you in the future.

564
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,000
Xiao Di!

565
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,400
Please wake up!

566
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm sorry!

567
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm sorry!

568
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Xiao Di!

569
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
You're okay.

570
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I was just joking.

571
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Why are you crying like this?

572
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm sorry.

573
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Are you crazy? You're joking!

574
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Are you crazy?

575
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Let me go!

576
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Xiao Di!

577
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't cry anymore.

578
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Out with this musical instrument.

579
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Is this the best that must have been made?

580
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Please go.

581
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I don't talk.

582
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Why do you want to lie to me?

583
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I...

584
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,500
I have limited edition blood to do sea institute work.

585
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,300
You're right. I deserve to die.

586
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,740
If I die, no one will bully you like this, Tian Tian.

587
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,340
Right.

588
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,300
You can calm down when you hit me.

589
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,100
You can hit me twice more.

590
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,780
You should be happier now.

591
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,700
Think about it.

592
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,220
You caught the man in black.

593
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,660
Then you can turn around.

594
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,700
You should be grateful to me now.

595
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,820
I can accept your gratitude.

596
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,140
Or I can thank you.

597
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,980
Thank you.

598
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,640
You too.

599
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,620
Don't be mad.

600
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
How can you make such a joke?

601
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
What about the person who worries about you?

602
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,620
I won't make such a joke anymore.

603
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,620
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,620
When did this happen?

605
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Why didn't you call the police?

606
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Tell me.

607
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
You guys are too much.

608
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
They are not even children anymore.

609
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Why are they not paying attention to what they are doing?

610
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
What if something really happens?

611
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
How will you explain it to his family?

612
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
I'll just say it. Who knows if he's really doing it?

613
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,620
You are his boss.

614
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
How can he not take it seriously?

615
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
You are also.

616
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
You take everything he says seriously?

617
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
I didn't think much about it.

618
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,620
I was just thinking about how to solve this matter.

619
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,620
Don't worry.

620
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
If something happens,

621
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
it won't drag the company down.

622
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
It will drag you down.

623
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,620
Then it's fine.

624
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
You are here to work.

625
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
You can get your revenge based on your work.

626
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
If you don't want to work, you can quit at any time.

627
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,620
I hope you work hard.

628
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
But remember,

629
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
you are not here to sell your life.

630
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Moreover, you brought a neighbor.

631
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
What if something happens to him?

632
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Xiao Nian.

633
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Xiao Nian, wake up.

634
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Xiao Nian, wake up.

635
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,620
I'm sorry, Mr. Ye.

636
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
I know I was wrong.

637
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
You don't have to apologize to me.

638
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
You can apologize to him later.

639
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Mr. Ye, boss.

640
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
I've been satisfied

641
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
with working in the company for so many days.

642
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
Thank you.

643
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Really.

644
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
Where are you going?

645
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
I'm going to pack up.

646
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,620
I'll come back to say goodbye to you.

647
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
What goodbye?

648
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
You've already transferred your license.

649
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
What goodbye?

650
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
Transfer my license?

651
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Yes.

652
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,620
Didn't he say

653
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
he would leave you after he got the license?

654
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,620
I'll fulfill his promise.

655
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
No, Mr. Ye.

656
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
I really didn't want to transfer my license.

657
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Boss just said it casually.

658
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
I just said it casually.

659
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
It's not your turn yet.

660
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
This is up to me.

661
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
You can leave.

662
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Nanxing.

663
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Get out.

664
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Why did you hide it from me?

665
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Death is not a small thing.

666
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
I was thinking

667
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,620
this is just a small security problem.

668
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,620
You don't have to deal with it yourself.

669
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
And you're so busy.

670
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,620
And you're dating.

671
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
Lu Zichen, can you not be so willful?

672
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,620
You didn't tell me about Su Yu's death.

673
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
You didn't tell me about the death threat.

674
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
I know you only like writing.

675
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
Write what you like.

676
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
Do what you like to do.

677
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,620
You said you didn't like the management company.

678
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
Okay, I'll try my best to manage this company.

679
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
Let's start this company together.

680
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
I support your dream of writing.

681
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,620
I want to put your work

682
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
on a bigger stage.

683
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,620
This is also my dream.

684
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,620
Can you understand me a little bit more?

685
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Can you not be so willful all the time?

686
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Mr. Xiao, right?

687
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
Sorry to trouble you.

688
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
It's okay.

689
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Take Mr. Xiao home to rest.

690
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
Let's go.

691
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
What are you doing here?

692
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,620
I just want to vent my anger.

693
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,620
I just want her to revive Su Yu.

694
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,620
I really didn't want to hurt her.

695
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,620
If you really like Su Yu,

696
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,620
you should respect and believe the person who created her.

697
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
Without her,

698
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
how can we have the Su Yu we like?

699
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,620
I have called the police.

700
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Please understand me.

701
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Like can't be the reason for you to do this.

702
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Xiao Wu Di.

703
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
That...

704
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
You don't have to thank me.

705
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
You caught this black fan today.

706
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
It's your own judgment.

707
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
So you don't have to thank me.

708
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
Who wants to thank you?

709
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,620
But I do want to apologize to you.

710
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Although you lied to me before, I was very angry.

711
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,620
But Mr. Ye is right.

712
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,620
I shouldn't let you take the risk.

713
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,620
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

714
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
It's okay.

715
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,620
I lied to you anyway.

716
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
We're even now.

717
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,620
The most important thing now is that you succeeded in turning over.

718
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,620
Don't think too much.

719
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,620
It's our Mr. Ye who insisted on turning over.

720
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Our boss seems to be not very happy.

721
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Ye Qing...

722
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Mr. Ye...

723
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,620
It seems that he has a different relationship with Lu Zichen.

724
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
You think too much.

725
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Our Mr. Ye has a boyfriend.

726
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
How do you know?

727
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
I overheard it.

728
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Coincidence.

729
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
I didn't mean to overheard it.

730
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,620
It's just a coincidence.

731
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,620
And our boss seems to be a little unhappy about Mr. Ye's relationship.

732
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,620
Actually, I feel guilty about turning over.

733
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,620
I don't know if those colleagues think I used some illegal means.

734
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
You can stay and stay.

735
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
It's up to you.

736
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,620
Anyway, tomorrow, you will see them.

737
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
They will come to you.

738
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Don't waste the night I've been with you.

739
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
I know.

740
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,620
Okay, I know.

741
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,620
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
I'm sorry.

744
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,620
I'm sorry.

747
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,620
I'm sorry.

748
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,620
I'm sorry.

749
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
I'm sorry.

750
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
I'm sorry.

751
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,620
I'm sorry.

752
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,620
