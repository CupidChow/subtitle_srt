1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Episode 10

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Slow down.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Stand still.

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,640
I'll call you to get a car.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
No.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I don't have a heart.

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Luo Wen.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Luo Wen.

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Do you want to...

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
What's going on?

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Why did the elevator stop?

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Why did the elevator stop?

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Calm down.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
If I call Xiao Odi here,

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
I can't explain it clearly.

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Nan Xiang.

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
You know how to deal with it.

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
It's okay.

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
There are such scenes in idol dramas.

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
It's usually nothing.

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Let me see.

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Hello.

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Is there anyone?

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Can you come and save us?

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
We're trapped inside.

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Can you come and save us?

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
There are two people trapped in the elevator.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Hello.

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Hello.

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Can you come and save us?

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Hello.

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Is there anyone there?

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Stay still.

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Can you come and save us?

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
The elevator door can't be opened.

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
When people are in danger,

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,640
they'd better be patient and be patient.

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
If someone else is in danger,

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,640
they'd better understand the other person's feelings.

70
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Besides, I've already made you look like he likes you.

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Can anyone hear me?

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Hello.

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Boss.

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
We can only wait here for a while.

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Do you want water?

76
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
I don't have water.

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
This is wine.

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I can't give you too much.

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
It's different.

80
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Boss, you drank too much today.

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
You drank too much.

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Boss, don't drink too much.

83
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
You really drank too much.

84
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Is it okay?

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
It's faster than I thought.

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Boss, I'm full.

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
I know what you want to say.

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
What?

89
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
You think I like Mr. Ye, don't you?

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Why did you tell me this?

91
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
It's horrible.

92
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
I'll drink a little too.

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,640
I don't like him at all.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
It's best if you don't like him.

95
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
I mean,

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
we're not that close, are we?

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
You don't have to talk to me about this.

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
My friend likes him.

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
What?

100
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
And a friend?

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I like him very much.

102
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
It doesn't matter.

103
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Are you going to keep talking?

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
I've liked him for many years.

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
But I never dared to confess to him.

106
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
He just thought

107
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
it's good to be together every day.

108
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
It's good to be like this forever.

109
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
But he's been in love lately.

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
His boyfriend proposed to him.

111
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
The point is, my friend,

112
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
he actually helped him.

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Do you think he's stupid?

114
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
He's not stupid.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Do you think he's stupid?

116
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
What should I say?

117
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Such a big secret

118
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
should be told by a blind secretary like me?

119
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
I'd better pretend to sleep.

120
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Don't touch me.

121
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Hello?

122
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
I've fallen asleep.

123
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
I've fallen asleep.

124
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
What's wrong?

125
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Are you okay?

126
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
I'm asleep.

127
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
What's wrong with you?

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Don't ask.

129
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I've fallen asleep.

130
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm not sleeping.

131
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Get up.

132
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Little Wu Di.

133
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Wait.

134
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
I can't.

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Why can't I?

136
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Take me back.

137
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Boss.

138
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
I can walk on my own.

139
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Go.

140
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Wait.

141
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
You designed all these, right?

142
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Work overtime, red dress,

143
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
and a red dress.

144
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
You're not a good designer.

145
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
You're not a good designer.

146
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
But you go to the sanatorium,

147
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
and take the elevator.

148
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
What do you want?

149
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Little Wu Di.

150
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Why are you running away?

151
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
What do you mean?

152
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
What do you mean?

153
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
If I hadn't help you,

154
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Lu zichen would have done it.

155
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I already said it,

156
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
you misunderstand me.

157
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
He doesn't like me.

158
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
He has someone he likes.

159
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,200
That's good.

160
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,120
You can't like him.

161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,760
Who do I like?

162
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,400
Do I need your approval?

163
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
He doesn't deserve you.

164
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
What do you mean?

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,720
He doesn't deserve me.

166
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
He doesn't deserve you.

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,760
There's no reason.

168
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,920
You're talking nonsense again.

169
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
He's so handsome,

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
so rich,

171
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
so famous.

172
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,200
How can he not deserve

173
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,360
a little transparent like me?

174
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,320
Why are you a little transparent?

175
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,400
Even if he's more famous

176
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
and richer than you,

177
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,160
it doesn't mean

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,040
he's worth being liked more than you.

179
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
You're great.

180
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,120
You're never worse than him.

181
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,240
Just talking about his looks,

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,080
how can he not deserve

183
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
this face?

184
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,480
Do you think I'm pretty?

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,480
I don't think you're pretty.

186
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,280
But you just...

187
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm a gentleman.

188
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
I don't know how many women I've met.

189
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
You're so far from being a gentleman.

190
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,360
If you come to Hehuang Palace,

191
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,520
you can even bathe me.

192
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,120
You said I'm pretty.

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
That's because I said

194
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Lu Zichen would like you.

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
It's because I

196
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
made you like him.

197
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
That's why he's so popular.

198
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,800
Do you think you're the only one?

199
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,480
How pretty,

200
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
how knowledgeable,

201
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
and how charming?

202
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,720
Just behave yourself in front of him.

203
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,440
And believe in yourself.

204
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
Believe in me.

205
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
Sha Wudi.

206
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
I thought you were really helping me.

207
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
So you're going back on your own.

208
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,360
And I've told you so many times.

209
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,320
I don't mean anything to him.

210
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,440
You said you wouldn't lie to me.

211
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,920
What did I say?

212
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,600
Sha Wudi.

213
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I won't believe in that ghost again.

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
Why hasn't he come yet?

215
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,760
What did he tell me to do in the past?

216
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
What's wrong with me today?

217
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Nanxin, you're back, Mom.

218
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Mom, I woke you up.

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Why are you back so late today?

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Are you hungry? I'll make you something to eat.

221
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
It's okay, I'm not hungry.

222
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
You're wearing high heels.

223
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
This dress...

224
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
It doesn't suit me, right?

225
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
It doesn't look right.

226
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm not used to it.

227
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
You're not used to it either, right?

228
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Mom, do you think I'm pretty?

229
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Why do you ask?

230
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Of course you're pretty.

231
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,320
My daughter is the second most beautiful in the world.

232
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,320
The first in the world is your mom and me.

233
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I think I'm pretty too.

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
But why has Nanxin never said that?

235
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Never?

236
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
No way.

237
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
None of them?

238
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Just talking about appearance, how can this face not deserve her?

239
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Do you think I'm pretty?

240
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
There is one.

241
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
But she's a liar.

242
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Are you a liar?

243
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
There is one who is better than none.

244
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Okay, go to bed.

245
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm going to sleep.

246
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Good night, mom.

247
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
You liar.

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
It feels like...

249
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Open the door.

250
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Xiao Buding?

251
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Get up.

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Xiao Buding, how can you joke like that?

253
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,320
What about the person you're worried about?

254
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I don't really like her, right?

255
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
If feeling.

256
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
You and your smile

257
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,320
I will follow you.

258
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
You can do it.

259
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Go in and hide.

260
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
I'll protect you.

261
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Divorge...

262
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,040
It's over.

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,800
Impossible.

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,520
Oh no.

265
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,800
How could I just have given it a second thought?

266
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm just gazing at your smile

267
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,440
Maybe it's the right time

268
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,680
My hero always takes the time to take away all my troubles

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Every corner of Leo

270
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
Leo Leo Leo Leo

271
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,760
Becomes the soil of love

272
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,440
Don't care about it anymore

273
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,040
A little bit like a star

274
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,760
Maybe it represents my heart

275
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,600
Leo Leo Leo Leo

276
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Oh beautiful sunset

277
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Leo Leo Leo

278
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
No feeling

279
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Really no feeling

280
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Little butterfly, you are revived, you are revived

281
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm just your hero

282
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm the young master of Hehuang, Xiao Wu Di

283
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

284
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,800
How could it be related to you, a woman?

285
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

286
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Becomes the soil of love

287
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Don't care about it anymore

288
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
A little bit like a star

289
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Maybe it represents my heart

290
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

291
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Oh beautiful sunset

292
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Leo Leo Leo

293
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Becomes the soil of love

294
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
No feeling

295
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Really no feeling

296
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Little butterfly, you are revived, you are revived

297
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm just your hero

298
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Why did I fall asleep like this?

299
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

300
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Becomes the soil of love

301
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

302
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Becomes the soil of love

303
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

304
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Becomes the soil of love

305
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

306
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Becomes the soil of love

307
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

308
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Becomes the soil of love

309
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

310
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Becomes the soil of love

311
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Leo Leo Leo

312
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Becomes the soil of love

313
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Leo Leo Leo Leo

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Becomes the soil of love

315
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Leo Leo Leo

316
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Becomes the soil of love

317
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Woke up

318
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
And I've figured it out.

319
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
It doesn't matter what you wear.

320
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,400
The most important thing is to adjust your attitude and improve your business ability.

321
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
You're so right.

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
I've said it before.

323
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Confidence isn't something a dress can give.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If a woman wants to be brave,

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,800
she has to be sure of herself first.

326
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Look at me.

327
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,800
When did you say that?

328
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,600
I say it every day.

329
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
You don't listen carefully.

330
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm listening.

331
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,200
But I think you've changed a lot recently.

332
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,400
How?

333
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,600
You seem to have a brighter eye.

334
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Is that so?

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
You're so ugly.

336
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,200
You're a little bit worse than your mom.

337
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,200
My heart has really grown.

338
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Morning.

339
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
Hey.

340
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,200
What happened yesterday is over.

341
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,600
I have a new strategy for you to find a boyfriend.

342
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
This time...

343
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I haven't finished yet.

344
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Where are you going?

345
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm learning from you.

346
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Didn't you leave like this yesterday?

347
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Let the past be the past.

348
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
People should learn to look ahead.

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This time, I...

350
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
I've decided.

351
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Decided what?

352
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I've decided not to believe what you said anymore.

353
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I did that yesterday for your own good.

354
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
For my own good?

355
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
You...

356
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,600
Come on.

357
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Why are you so angry?

358
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Let it out.

359
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
It'll be fine if you let it out.

360
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I thought you were actually a good person.

361
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
I really was wrong.

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Forget it.

363
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
He's a villain anyway.

364
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm the one who's stupid.

365
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,000
I didn't find out earlier.

366
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Boss, good morning.

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Morning.

368
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
You go first.

369
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
You go first.

370
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,400
Hello?

371
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You should go first.

372
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay, I'll be there soon.

373
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
Excuse me.

374
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Okay, okay.

375
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
Bye.

376
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Are you two going up?

377
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
Yes, we are.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Let's go up.

379
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Which floor are you going to?

380
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
24th, thank you.

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
What about you?

382
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
24th.

383
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,600
What should I do?

384
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Does he still remember what happened yesterday?

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Is it over?

386
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,200
Just pretend that nothing happened yesterday.

387
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Don't tell anyone.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay.

389
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Especially,

390
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
Ye Zuo.

391
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Okay, Boss.

392
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Remember, keep it a secret.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We've been together for so long, and you're proposing to me?

394
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I've been with Ye Qing recently.

395
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think she's the one I want.

396
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,800
I want to propose to her as soon as possible.

397
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,000
Song Jiaming.

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,200
You shouldn't say it.

399
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Ye Qing.

400
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
I have an idea.

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,600
You know, my company is mainly about writing suspense novels.

402
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,800
If we add some scientific elements to Zichen's novel,

403
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,600
are you going to talk to me?

404
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
It's okay, go on.

405
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Han Shini has already said it.

406
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Are you going to talk to me?

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Ye Qing.

408
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Marry me.

409
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Let me take care of you.

410
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Let me take care of you.

411
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,800
I... I haven't thought it through.

413
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
She's agreed.

414
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Marry me.

415
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Let me take care of you.

416
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
You...

417
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
So, did you say it or not?

418
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I thought you were a good person.

419
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I didn't think I was wrong.

420
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I don't know what I am.

421
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I don't need you to tell me.

422
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Why am I not a good person?

423
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
What are you looking at?

424
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Do you have any opinions?

425
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Let me tell you.

426
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I'm doing this for her.

427
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Why did I lie to her?

428
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Even if I lied to her, so what?

429
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Do I need to apologize to her?

430
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Impossible.

431
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Secret.

433
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
If I didn't keep it,

434
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
would she tell me?

435
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,400
What if I accidentally told her?

436
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I won't talk to her in the company.

437
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Men are so troublesome.

438
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
What's wrong with men?

439
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Let's go.

440
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
What's wrong?

441
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
We're not busy today.

442
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm so bored at work.

443
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Which man is bothering you?

444
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Is it a girl?

445
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
No.

446
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I just said it casually.

447
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
You have a boyfriend?

448
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
How do you know him?

449
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
How do you know him?

450
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
He's been working so hard.

451
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
How can he have time to date?

452
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Yes.

453
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
He worked overtime yesterday.

454
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
He's with her now.

455
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
He's the boss.

456
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You're not bothering the boss, are you?

457
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Yes.

458
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Don't talk nonsense.

459
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
I want to get rid of you.

460
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
He's the boss.

461
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
We're the boss.

462
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
You're too much.

463
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I'll answer the phone.

464
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Hello.

465
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Come out.

466
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm in front of your company.

467
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Come out?

468
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
What are you...

469
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Come out?

470
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Okay, wait for me.

471
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'll go out.

472
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Come on.

473
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
I bet 100 yuan on the boss.

474
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
What are you doing here?

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
I just passed by.

476
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Let's have a meal.

477
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Who wants to have a meal with you?

478
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I've said it.

479
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I won't believe you anymore.

480
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Just a meal.

481
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
I won't sell you.

482
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Who knows?

483
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
If you sell me,

484
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I'll have to count the money.

485
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Don't think too much.

486
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Come with me.

487
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
No.

488
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Wait.

489
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
What about this?

490
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
What's this?

491
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Last night,

492
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
you and Lu Zichen...

493
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
The boss worked overtime yesterday.

494
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Nanxing is with him.

495
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
He's the boss.

496
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Did you cause any trouble to the boss?

497
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Yes.

498
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Let's go.

499
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Hello.

500
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Please check what you need.

501
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Thank you.

502
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Thank you.

503
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Call me if you need anything.

504
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Look.

505
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
What do you want to eat?

506
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Okay.

507
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
I'll return this to you.

508
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
I don't need it anyway.

509
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
You must have left a copy.

510
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
That's all.

511
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
I'll return it to you.

512
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
No way.

513
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I won't be your pawn.

514
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
What's wrong with him?

515
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I swear to God,

516
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
if I lie to you again,

517
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I'll never go back to the Hehuang Palace.

518
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Is this an apology?

519
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Old-fashioned men are troublesome.

520
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
You really didn't leave a copy?

521
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I swear to God,

522
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
if I leave a copy...

523
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Stop.

524
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I believe you for the last time.

525
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Sit down.

526
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Although I didn't lie to you this time,

527
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I swear to believe it.

528
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,740
You're really a little

529
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm so hungry.

530
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Come and see what you want to eat.

531
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Whatever you want.

532
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Pizza.

533
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
No, this price is too reasonable.

534
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Waiter.

535
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Hello, what do you need?

536
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I want a margherita pizza.

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
And sausage platter.

538
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:17,020
This is a meal for the

539
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,400
I haven't eaten ice cream yet.

540
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
You haven't eaten ice cream?

541
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
You're so poor.

542
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Ice cream is so delicious.

543
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
After I came here,

544
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I haven't tried many things.

545
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
This ice cream,

546
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
and the new one,

547
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
escape from the secret room.

548
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
That seems to be interesting.

549
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Then give it to me.

550
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
I'll order.

551
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
This is too expensive.

552
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
I'll take you to the convenience store.

553
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
The convenience store is delicious and cheap.

554
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Wait a minute.

555
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Hello, Sisi.

556
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
World, inter-tribal emergency.

557
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Do you have any arrangements at night?

558
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
At night? No.

559
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
What's wrong?

560
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Do you want to eat together?

561
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
I want to eat together.

562
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Someone is treating me.

563
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Brother Xiao Hao came back from abroad.

564
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
He invited me to dinner.

565
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I said I would invite you too.

566
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
He wants to invite you.

567
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
I can't go to the convenience store.

568
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Don't talk nonsense.

569
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Brother Xiao Hao is really handsome.

570
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Handsome?

571
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
How handsome can he be?

572
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
You promise?

573
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
OK, I'll go there tonight.

574
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
OK, go to the barbecue shop we often go to.

575
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Seven o'clock at night.

576
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
OK, bye. See you tonight.

577
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Who?

578
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Who is handsome?

579
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Xiao Hao's brother.

580
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,400
So you are going on a blind date, right?

581
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
How can this be considered a blind date?

582
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Just to meet a friend.

583
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Two men and two women are not blind dates?

584
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
What do you want to do again?

585
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
If you are a blind date,

586
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
I will wish you success.

587
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
If you are a blind date,

588
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I can go back early.

589
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
You'd better be.

590
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
It's time for me to go to work.

591
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I have to go now.

592
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I warn you.

593
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Don't give me any more trouble.

594
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Especially don't get my boss in.

595
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Ice cream next time.

596
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Bye.

597
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Bye.

598
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Blind date.

599
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Nanxing, come here.

600
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Come in.

601
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Boss.

602
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Go in.

603
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Boss, what do you want me to do?

604
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,400
You go to help me investigate something.

605
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
OK, what is it?

606
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
You tell me.

607
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
You go to help me check

608
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
whether Mr. Ye was proposed.

609
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Did he agree?

610
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
I don't know.

611
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I don't know.

612
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
I don't know.

613
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I don't know.

614
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I don't know.

615
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Did he agree?

616
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
This is my job.

617
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
You are my personal assistant.

618
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Solving my problem is your job.

619
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
OK, I'll check it.

620
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
But boss,

621
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
I think the problem is not here.

622
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
If you want to know,

623
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
you can send him a WeChat message.

624
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Why do you have to go around such a big circle?

625
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Although I have never been in love,

626
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I know that

627
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
if you like someone,

628
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
you have to face your true heart bravely.

629
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
If you don't have the courage to be true,

630
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
you'd better give up early.

631
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm not talking about you.

632
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I'm talking about your friend.

633
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I know.

634
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I know.

635
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
What do you usually like to play?

636
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Shijie.

637
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Tomorrow we will finish our training

638
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
and go to see a movie.

639
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Your brother is 25 years old.

640
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
That movie is a love movie.

641
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Then I heard that it was good.

642
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
So I bought the ticket.

643
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Will your brother go abroad later?

644
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
How long will he stay this time?

645
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I don't know.

646
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Senior, after watching the movie,

647
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
we can go to eat pizza.

648
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
You said you liked pizza last time.

649
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I found a store.

650
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I went to eat it.

651
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
It's really good.

652
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Then call your brother.

653
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Call my brother.

654
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
My brother is busy.

655
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
He didn't cry.

656
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Why did you put it back?

657
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I like this the most.

658
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Why do you always put it back?

659
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Senior, this has too much fat content.

660
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
You can't eat it.

661
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
It's very bad for you.

662
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I like to eat.

663
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
You always throw it in.

664
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
What do I eat?

665
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
No, the coach will...

666
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
That's it.

667
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
You go and roast it.

668
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Hurry up.

669
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay.

670
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
This is the first time I meet my brother.

671
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Would you like to have a drink?

672
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Okay, let's drink together.

673
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Where?

674
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Leixin, I heard that you work in the office.

675
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
What kind of work do you do?

676
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm the CEO's assistant.

677
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
CEO's assistant?

678
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Should you usually have a lot of work?

679
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
No.

680
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
A little bit.

681
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Thank you.

682
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Thank you, boss.

683
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Slow down.

684
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Your boss should be famous.

685
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
You usually interview him.

686
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I don't do that.

687
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Is there anything?

688
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
There's nothing.

689
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
It's just a little thing.

690
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
You can't handle it.

691
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I will take it.

692
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,000
Really?

693
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,600
I don't know.

694
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,480
Do you often join activities together?

695
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,680
Not really.

696
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,280
Then...

697
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,160
Then you don't know how to cook?

698
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,640
You asked so much.

699
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,160
You still say you don't know how to cook.

700
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,560
Boss.

701
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,760
I'll help you.

702
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,800
Thank you, sir.

703
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,680
You're welcome.

704
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,760
You really want to drink?

705
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,600
Then you're done.

706
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,120
This is our wine god.

707
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,480
Really?

708
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,640
He's lying.

709
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,160
Come on.

710
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,680
Let's drink to you.

711
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,120
Come on.

712
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,680
Cheers.

713
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,480
Thank you, sisters.

714
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,440
Cheers.

715
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,040
Isn't this blind date?

716
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,080
Drinking?

717
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,040
What do you do?

718
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,880
I used to study sports.

719
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,760
But now I'm a side-by-side photographer.

720
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,480
So awesome.

721
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,360
What do you mean awesome?

722
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,080
I just want you to see my power.

723
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,120
The effect is really good.

724
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Boss, they're done.

725
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,960
OK.

726
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,480
Boss, is our roast ready?

727
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,960
Yes.

728
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,440
OK.

729
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,960
This one?

730
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
OK, thank you.

731
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,120
Come on, stop looking.

732
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,960
Eat it.

733
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,320
What's this?

734
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Pig skin.

735
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,200
Pig skin?

736
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,360
What's wrong?

737
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,600
Xiao Hao.

738
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,160
Brother, sister.

739
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,640
There's a table tennis over there.

740
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,080
Let's play table tennis, OK?

741
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,800
Table tennis?

742
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
OK, I'm good at table tennis.

743
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,960
Let's go.

744
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,800
But I'm not good at it.

745
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
I'll teach you.

746
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,400
OK.

747
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Table tennis is easy.

748
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,560
Really.

749
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,040
You can do it with your hands.

750
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,680
OK.

751
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
How can we play?

752
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,360
How about a group competition?

753
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,240
I'll play with Sisi.

754
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,840
I'll play with Brother Sheng Hao.

755
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,000
OK.

756
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,320
Brother Sheng Hao, you're new here.

757
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,240
Let's have you play table tennis.

758
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,840
But I'm not good at it.

759
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
I'll teach you.

760
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,440
OK.

761
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,360
First, your left hand is like this.

762
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,240
It's like a hand-holding.

763
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,080
Here.

764
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,160
Be gentle.

765
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
Not bad.

766
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,320
You're good.

767
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,080
Let's continue.

768
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,160
Continue.

769
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,840
It's OK.

770
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,080
Let them play.

771
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,200
If you like someone,

772
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,080
you should face your true feelings bravely.

773
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,600
If you don't have the courage,

774
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,960
you'd better give up.

775
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,760
OK.

776
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Why are you still here?

777
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,160
Have you eaten?

778
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,720
No.

779
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,040
Let's go together.

780
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,000
Come here.

781
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,560
What's wrong?

782
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,880
Right.

783
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,880
What's up?

784
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400
I... I'd like to ask...

785
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,160
What?

786
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,800
Ask...

787
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,160
You...

788
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,360
Where's your necklace?

789
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,800
I returned it.

790
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,800
Returned it?

791
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
w-why?

792
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,960
Did you weave it?

793
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,520
We broke up, we need to get back together.

794
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,040
You broke up?

795
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,360
You broke up with Song Xiao Ming?

796
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,320
Yes.

797
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,000
He's a good man.

798
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,600
But he's not suitable for her.

799
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,040
That's a pity.

800
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,920
Hello.

801
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm fine now.

802
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,120
What did you say?

803
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,520
Nothing.

804
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,080
I'm fine.

805
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:54,900
You've got a

806
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,400
baby.

807
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
I'm sorry.

808
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm so sorry.

809
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
I should have avoided it.

810
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
I'll die.

811
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
I'll find another job.

812
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Hello, boss.

813
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
They broke up.

814
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
What did you say?

815
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Who broke up?

816
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Mr. Ye broke up with his boyfriend.

817
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Thank you.

818
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Why thank me?

819
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,520
My friend never had a relationship.

820
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
So he doesn't know much about girls.

821
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
And he doesn't understand many things.

822
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I encouraged him because of you.

823
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
So thank you.

824
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll leave it to you.

825
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
Boss, I don't understand anything.

826
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
You can't...

827
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Ah.

828
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
What kind of job is this?

829
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,520
You're different from your boss.

830
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
You're so indifferent.

831
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
You like him but you don't dare to say it.

832
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
He's happy after you broke up.

833
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
He's happy.

834
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
Why did he tell me?

835
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Boss.

836
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
I'm your assistant.

837
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Not your best friend.

838
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
What time is it?

839
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
What time is it?

840
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
What time is it?

841
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Do you want to come back?

842
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Little Wu Di.

843
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Little Wu Di.

844
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Little Wu Di.

845
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
You asked me to open the door.

846
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
But I have to open it?

847
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Little Wu Di.

848
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Little Wu Di.

849
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Little Wu Di.

850
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
Little Wu Di.

851
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Okay.

852
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
I'll see what you want to do.

853
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,520
What?

854
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
You're so happy after the blind date.

855
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
Why are you looking for me?

856
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
I bought you ice cream.

857
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
I'll tell you first.

858
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
I bought you ice cream.

859
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
It doesn't mean I forgive you.

860
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,520
I'm sorry that some people haven't eaten ice cream.

861
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,520
And I promised you to buy ice cream for you in the convenience store.

862
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,520
Plus, the store we ate today is too expensive.

863
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,520
You have money but you can't eat it.

864
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,520
You can't eat it.

865
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,520
You're so poor.

866
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Do you understand?

867
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
I'll open it for you.

868
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Eat it.

869
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,520
You melt the ice cream like this.

870
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
How can you eat it?

871
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
It's also edible.

872
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
Okay.

873
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
I'll do it myself.

874
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
Is it delicious?

875
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
Delicious.

876
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
You don't eat it.

877
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
You'll melt it.

878
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
I'll help you.

879
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
I just ate it.

880
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
It's delicious.

881
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
I'll help you.

882
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
I'll help you.

883
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
I'll help you.

884
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,520
But I also want to eat it.

885
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
I want to eat it.

886
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
I want to eat it.

896
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
I want to eat it.

897
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
I want to eat it.

898
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
I want to eat it.

I want to eat it.

902
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
