No need for that.

115

Why have you returned here?

Did you steal my keys again?

142

Do you expect me to wait for you

143
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,250
in front of the door then?

144

Were you hurt?

145
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,680
Lowly thugs like them

146
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,020
can never hurt me.

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,680
I'm glad to hear that.

148
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,380
Where did you go after that?

149
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,780
I went back to the mall
to retrieve my stuff.

150
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,290
This is a warning.

151
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,560
You better pick an appropriate time

152

if you plan to summon me next time.

153
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,670
You won't be able to afford them

154
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,550
if I lose them.

155
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,530
Did you rob a bank?

156
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,150
Are you sure you only pawned
your jade pendant

157
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,080
and didn't rob a bank?

158
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,350
Although I don't mind

159
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,980
messing with the cops here,

160
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,330
I won't attract their attention

161
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,460
under such circumstances

162
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,850
unless it's necessary.

163
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,230
After all,

164
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,860
I don't have

165
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,330
a legal identity in this era yet.

166
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,330
Great. You had me for a moment there.

167
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,110
If so...

168
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,950
Are you trying

169
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,250
to ask me why I appeared

170
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,640
and saved you again?

171
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,780
Let me be clear with you.

172
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,640
I wasn't trying to save you.

173
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,160
I was just keeping an eye on my hostage.

174
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,460
Besides,

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
when it comes to double-crossing people,

176
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,900

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,070
who can double-cross other people.

178
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,470
So, it was me

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,070
who summoned you again?

180
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,920
I remember I told you this before.

181
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,680
I heard your voice

182
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,070
before I was summoned by you.

183
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,420
[Someone, help me.
Stop showing off your relationship.]

184
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,060
[Can someone help me out?]

185
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,000
[Help!]

186
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,100
I heard your voice again this time.

187
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,260
But what's the connection
between the two incidents?

188
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,790
Although the words you said

189
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,200
weren't related,

190
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,300
both situations

191
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,630
were pretty similar.

192
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,630
It happens

193
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,480
whenever you need a hero

194
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,860
to save you.

195
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,880
A hero?

196
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,070
You don't say?

197
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,040
Do you think you can escape unscathed

198
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,920
in both situations

199
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,050
without any help?

200
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,750
[He's the person]

201
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,480
[the fairy had sent to save me.]

202
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,900
[If so, that means]

203
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,100
[I can do whatever I want in the future.]

204
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,470
[I just need to summon him]

205
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,110
[during crucial moments.]

206
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,950
Let me warn you.

207
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,230
You're not allowed

208
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,460
to get into any trouble in the future.

209
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,390
What trouble can I get into?

210
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,690
With a brain like yours,

211
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,450
I wouldn't be surprised

212
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,780
if you get into trouble.

213
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,590
Anyway, I've made myself clear.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,070
If you summon me again,

215
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,030
I will never help you out

216
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,690
no matter what happens to you.

217
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,760
And, if you keep

218
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,230
getting into trouble,

219
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,220
I have no choice

220
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,880
but to deal with
a troublemaker like you first.

221
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,400
Time to sleep.

222
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,560
Wait!

223
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,450
What's wrong again?

224
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,320
Cut to the chase.

225
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,480
I will definitely regret this.

226
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,160
Come with me.

227
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,460
Come on.

228
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,410
Come in.

229
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,520
Whose house is this?

230
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,240
Of course it's mine.

231
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,940
Let me make things clear.

232
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,150
This is only

233
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
a temporary shelter for you.

234
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,980
I won't charge you any rent for now.

235
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,120
But only

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,170
if you agree to one condition.

237
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,930
What condition?

238
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,080
You cannot

239
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,720
come to find me whenever you like it,

240
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,380
especially

241
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,830
when my mother is around.

242
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,870
If not, I won't be able to explain myself

243
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,330
when she sees us together.

244
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
Are you saying

245
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,060
that I need to consider your feelings

246
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,990
and not create any trouble for you?

247
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,380
That's right.

248
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,070
But why must I

249
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,640
consider your feelings?

250
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,510
You!

251
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,290
Did you forget your status?

252
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,120
You're a hostage.

253
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,550
I'm the one who's keeping you hostage.

254
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,880
You don't want your mother
to see me? Fine.

255
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,920
You have to give me something in return.

256
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,930
You're

257
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,200
rotten to the core.

258
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,730
You don't like it?

259
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,730
I can move back to your unit anytime.

260
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,930
Your bed is pretty comfortable anyway.

261
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,980
Wait a minute!

262
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,210
Tell me then.

263
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,390
What do you want?

264
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,410
I need

265
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,710
a smartphone.

266
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,540
You actually know what a smartphone is?

267
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,300
A smartphone

268
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,400
is just like a personal computer.

269
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,290
It has an independent operating space

270
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,510
and its own programs.

271
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,520
Its user can install

272
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,500
software, games, navigation apps,

273
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,550
and all kinds of programs offered by

274
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,430
third-party service providers.

275
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,290
It's a collective term for phones

276
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,790
that can connect to
the Internet wirelessly

277
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,250
through a mobile network.

278
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,920
You...

279
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,740
There's no need to be surprised.

280
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,400
I have a photographic memory.

281
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,140
I think I have

282
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,520
a spare smartphone...

283
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,490
For the time being,

284
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,960
I need to study

285
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,550
how to return to the ancient era.

286
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,770
The information I can get online

287
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,950
is way more than
what I can get from the library.

288
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,380
And, they're updated at a rapid pace.

289
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,430
So, do not bother me

290
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,690
for the time being.

291
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,940
Logically speaking,

292
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,510
you should be responsible

293
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,390
for providing me with

294
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,990
my meals and accommodation.

295
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,780
However,

296
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,130
given to your careless character,

297
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,810
you just need to deliver
three meals per day to me

298
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,900
on time.

299
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,800
I don't have that kind of money.

300
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,400
Tell me when you're out of cash.

301
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,490
This is a lot.

302
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,210
Tonight,

303
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,550
move all my belongings

304
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,610
to the living room.

305
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,360
Do not interrupt my sleep.

306
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,990
But you...

307
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,350
I'm going to sleep now.

308
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,240
Care to join me?

309
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,180
Nope.

310
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,150
Wait.

311
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,320
Why are you afraid of fire?

312
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,760
When I was in middle school,

313
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,130
I was trapped in a fire.

314
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,370
Since then,

315
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,840
I've been traumatized.

316
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,490
When I see fire,

317
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,260
I'll panic and lose control.

318
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,400
The doctor said

319
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,160
it was a type of mental disorder.

320
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,250
Although it's been many years,

321
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,450
I'll suffer a relapse from time to time.

322
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,760
So, even the current doctors
couldn't treat your condition?

323
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,400
The doctor said

324
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,290
the doer needs to undo what he has done.

325
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,859
However, those people

326
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,160
are already gone.

327
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,770
However,

328
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,450
I'll be fine if I don't see any fire

329
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,920
when I'm panicking.

330
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,430
For example,

331
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,650
I'll skip the candles during my birthday.

332
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,610
I'll skip the fireworks

333
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,750
and avoid using gas to cook in the house.

334
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,280
As long as

335
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,300
I can avoid them,

336
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,060
I'll be fine.

337
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,910
I found out another of your weakness now.

338
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,150
[I said you would be recruited.]

339
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,830
When did you say that?

340
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,920
[Didn't I always]

341
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,800
[say that?]

342
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,430
[Our Nan Xing is the best,]

343
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,240
[right?]

344
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,550
[If only I were there.]

345
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,950
[We could've celebrated the occasion.]

346
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,340
[I think I'll perform
the day after tomorrow.]

347
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,430
[It'll be over in two days.]

348
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,090

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,610
I'll resume my work now.

524
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,500
You're Nan Xing, right?

525
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,500
Come with me.

526
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:56,900
Come on.

527
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,030
It's not like I'll eat you alive.

528
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,560
Go now.

529
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,550
[Ye]

530
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,020
Come in.

531
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,340
Have a seat.

532
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,550
You didn't graduate from
the required course,

533
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,480
and you had no previous
working experiences, right?

534
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,680
However, you're an avid reader
of Lu Zichen's works.

535
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,160
I've read your resume

536
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,500
and the records of your job interview.

537
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Actually, you don't have

538
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,230
the requirements

539
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,090
to be the president's assistant.

540
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
However, I still

541
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,530
allowed them to recruit you.

542
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,390
Do you know why?

543
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,210
It's because you said

544
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,530
you won't forsake your chance or give up.

545
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,850
I was an athlete.

546
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,620
My career as an athlete had taught me

547
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,600
not to give up until victory is achieved.

548
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I won't forsake my chance or give up.

549
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,240
If you can

550
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,450
truly achieve that,

551
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,650
I believe

552
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,740
that you're qualified for the job.

553
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,630
Can you do it?

554
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,830
You can talk, right?

555
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,620
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,950
I'm just a bit nervous.

557
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,590
You're this nervous

558
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,680
when you're facing me?

559
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,190
How can you face Lu Zichen then?

560
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,660
How can you work as his assistant?

561
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,630
Being the boss's assistant

562
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,390
is the best position
for you to pick up new skills.

563
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,700
If you're willing to work hard,

564
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,360
you'll be able to grow quickly.

565
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,020
I was his assistant back then.

566
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,300
I know that.

567
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,450
I saw those articles online...

568
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,540
Most gossips you see online

569
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,330
were true,

570
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,050
except for

571
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,940
the one where they said
we had a relationship.

572
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,540
[So, she reads them too?]

573
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,810
But of course,

574
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,570
he's the largest asset of the company.

575
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,170
That's why it's part of my job

576
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,050
to be concerned about
the public's opinion of him.

577
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,580
I was his assistant for a decade.

578
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,350
Today, I wish to impart

579
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,400
the burden to you.

580
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,240
Is that okay?

581
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,480
I think so.

582
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,020
You face the highest possibility
of being fired

583
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,490
as the president's assistant.

584
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,370
Even if you fail,

585
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,830
it's not that big of a deal.

586
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,570
And, you've already joined our company.

587
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,370
I guess you've fulfilled your wish
of meeting your idol.

588
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,380
The result isn't important.

589
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,510
You should enjoy the process instead.

590
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,970
You may resume your work.

591
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,180
[Ye]

592
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,100
[I'll do the same thing this year.]

593
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,670
[I'll teach you how to skate on ice.]

594
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,730
[Happy birthday.]

595
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,670
Miss Jiao.

596
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,540
I'll head there first.

597
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,600
I'll be there soon.

598
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,440
Miss Jiao,

599
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,740
is that flower

600
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,410
a gift from my colleagues?

601
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,430
I think

602
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,070
the previous assistant
forgot to bring it with her

603
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,750
when she left the company.

604
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,520
It's still pretty fresh.

605
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,140
You face the highest possibility
of being fired

606
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,870
as the president's assistant.

607
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,250
Miss Jiao,

608
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,320
does our boss have a fierce temper?

609
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,220
Did Miss Ye tell you that?

610
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,970
You don't need to worry.

611
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,680
Our boss is a cultured person.

612
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,350
He never reprimands anyone.

613
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,190
Yeah.

614
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,080
That's how I felt about him

615
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,750
when I saw him

616
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,800
during a signing session.

617
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,570
Usually, he'll fire the person immediately

618
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,120
if he's unhappy with him.

619
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,130
He won't reprimand or scold you.

620
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,240
You don't need to be too nervous.

621
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,290
Our boss

622
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,660
doesn't appear in the company usually.

623
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,990
Usually, he stays at home

624
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,910
to write his scripts.

625
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,970
Sometimes, he'll come to the company

626
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,270
for a meeting or something.

627
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,240
That means

628
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,590
he doesn't appear in the company often.

629
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,300
However, that also means

630
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,900
that he might appear
in the company at any time.

631
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,480
If so, what do I need to prepare?

632
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,570
You don't need to make any preparations.

633
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,290
-You just need to be mentally prepared.
-Miss Jiao.

634
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,010
Everyone is here.

635
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,470
Coming.

636
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,600
I'll head to the meeting first.

637
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
You may resume your work.

638
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,680
Yufan,

639
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,300
I forgot to bring my mug today.

640
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,160
Are there

641
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,210
any extra mugs in the company?

642
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,430
Can I borrow one?

643
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,870
Don't tell me you didn't

644
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,800
take a single sip from morning until now?

645
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,390
Aren't you thirsty

646
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,490
when you haven't
taken a sip the entire day?

647
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,090
Follow me.

648
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,090
What's going on?

649
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,080
These are

650
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,670
the spare mugs.

651
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,320
You can use them.

652
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,790
Wash it after using it.

653
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,460
After that, put it back.

654
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,590
Alright, thank you.

655
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,040
Say,

656
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,180
should we bring Nan Xing

657
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,620
to the newcomer party tonight?

658
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,330
Did you forget about

659
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,990
all the previous assistants?

660
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,190
They were fired right after the party.

661
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,540
It was awkward.

662
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,060
I think Yufan has a point.

663
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,410
Let's go. Stop staring at her.

664
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,380
Guys, work time's over.

665
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,740
I'll make a move first.

666
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,790
Nan Xing, see you around.
Go back early, okay?

667
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,390
Miss Jiao!

668
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,850
So,

669
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,700
what are my tasks

670
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,790
for tomorrow?

671
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,680
Tomorrow?

672
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,530
Chu,

673
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,460
if you have anything

674
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,120
you need to print tomorrow...

675
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,400
Sure!

676
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,210
I'll get off work then.

677
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:17,720
Goodbye.

678
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,430
Okay, goodbye.

679
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,650
Goodbye.

680
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,160
Goodbye, Nan Xing.

681
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,710
Goodbye.

682
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,820
Yufan, goodbye.

683
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,570
Nan Xing?

684
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,590
What's wrong?

685
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,260
Are you upset on your first day of work?

686
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
That's not it.

687
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,920
Nan Xing, don't overthink it.

688
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,450
It's your first day of work.

689
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,030
You should celebrate
this occasion with a friend.

690
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,620
Yeah.

691
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,790
Don't be upset.

692
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,260
By the way,

693
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,150
we have plenty of books
to transport tomorrow.

694
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,370
Can you help us out?

695
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,800
Of course. No problem.

696
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,350
Really?

697
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,520
Thank you so much.

698
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,580
Nan Xing, we'll make a move first.

699
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:03,910
Okay.

700
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,800
Don't be upset.

701
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,470
Got it.

702
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,270
You can do it!

703
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,940
Goodbye.

704
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,060
Celebrate this occasion with my friends?

705
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,530
Fine.

706
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,199
Who should I find?

707
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,190
Since Aunt An isn't around...

708
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,989
Xiong Sisi.

709
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,870
Hello, Sisi?

710
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,010
[Hello, Xing?]

711
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,100
[Today's your first day of work.]

712
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,070
[How did you feel?]

713
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,159
Were you excited

714
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,750
when you saw your idol?

715
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,310
I didn't get to see him.

716
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,310
The boss wasn't around today.

717
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,190
[I heard that he doesn't
appear in the company often.]

718
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,770
[You had no idea.]

719
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,030
[I was so nervous today.]

720
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,710
I didn't even know

721
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,800
what I should do.

722
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,179
Oh yeah,

723
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,530
since today's my first day of work,

724
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,239
do you want to come out

725
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,239
and celebrate the occasion with me?

726
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
[Tonight? I can't make it tonight.]

727
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,040
It's all Hao's fault.

728
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,760
He just had

729
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,469
to accept

730
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,880
our coach's special training tonight.

731
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,080
Sorry, Xing.

732
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,090
Sorry for not being there with you.

733
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,980
[Why don't we celebrate it tomorrow?]

734
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,580
It's okay.

735
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,790
It's fine. Go ahead.

736
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,980
It's decided then.

737
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,320
Xing, I'll hang up now.

738
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,570
I'm happy for you.

739
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,500
Good luck!

740
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,010
Alright, got it.

741
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,940
Goodbye.

742
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,980
[Goodbye.]

743
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,590
Keep your water bottle.

744
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,950
Sisi is busy too.

745
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,090
Who else can I find?

746
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,820
Xiao Wudi?

747
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,470
No way.

748
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,480
Definitely not him.

749
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,570
I think I should celebrate this myself.

750
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,080
[So, even Stephen Hawking thinks]

751
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,060
[that time travel is impossible.]

752
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,250
[If so, how can I return to my era?]

753
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,520
[Don't tell me I have to stay here]

754
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,580
[and be the bodyguard of that dummy?]

755
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,110
Why isn't my dinner here yet?

756
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,500
Could it be

757
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,310
that she forgot to order it for me?

758
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,440
One Stir-Fried Glutinous Rice Balls,

759
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,720
one Fish in Sour Soup,

760
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,290
and one Stir-Fried Snow Peas
with Preserved Sausage.

761
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,420
For how many people?

762
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,890
For me alone.

763
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,440
Can you finish them?

764
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,750
Yeah.

765
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,750
Give me one steamed egg,

766
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,720
one Crucian Carp Tofu Soup,

767
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,920
and one Chinese Cucumber Salad.

768
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,580
That's all.

769
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,890
Are you sure you can finish them?

770
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,490
I'll bring them back home
if I can't finish them,

771
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,040
mister.

772
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,270
Give me a second.

773
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,900
Hello.

774
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,210
Here.

775
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,870
Here, let's have a toast.

776
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,620
Thank you.

777
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,840
This is our signature dish.

778
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,030
You'll feel happy

779
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,090
when you try it.

780
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,300
Enjoy your meal.

781
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,090
Thanks.

782
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
It's pretty good.

783
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,150
Try this.

784
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:51,910
Okay.

785
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,640
Okay.

786
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,950
Today,

787
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,550
I've worked as his assistant.

788
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,300
I guess

789
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,760
I've realized my dream.

790
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,410
I'm already doing great.

791
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,590
Don't overthink it.

792
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,530
From tomorrow onward,

793
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,160
I need to be more proactive.

794
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,750
She didn't order food for me?
Fine, I'll dine outside.

795
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,640
What if I'm still nervous tomorrow?

796
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,840
What should I do then?

797
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,430
You got something on your lips.

798
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,440
Help.

799
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,380
You got some on your lips too.

800
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,390
When will

801
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,150
someone wipe my mouth for me?

802
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,840
I wonder how it feels like?

803
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,320
[Help.]

804
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,870
[When will]

805
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,730
[someone wipe my mouth for me?]

806
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,980
[I wonder how it feels like?]

807
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,690
Did I summon you again?

808
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,240
When will

809
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,470
someone wipe my mouth for me?

810
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,240
I wonder how it feels like?

811
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,910
Did you hear that as well?

812
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,460
Is that even considered trouble?

813
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,940
There's just no one
to wipe your mouth for you.

814
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,750
Lower your volume!

815
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,890
I already told you before.

816
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,900
Next time,

817
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,120
I will never help you out

818
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,630
no matter

819
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,010
the reason you summon me,

820
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,270
let alone for a trivial matter like this.

821
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,180
What's wrong with wiping my mouth for me?

822
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,030
I just wanted someone
to wipe my mouth for me.

823
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,870
[When will]

824
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,650
[someone wipe my mouth for me?]

825
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,490
[I wonder how it feels like?]

826
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,140
Xiao Wudi?

827
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,680
Look at him. What's wrong with him?

828
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,030
Are you okay?

829
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,530
What's the matter?

830
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,010
There are so many people around!

831
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,940
Let go of me!

832
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,080
Hurry!

833
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,040
Don't wipe my mouth!

834
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,370
I don't need you to do it!

835
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,650
Are you happy now?

836
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,120
What have I done to deserve this?

837
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,770
Xiao Wudi, you!

838
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,610
You must be out of your mind!

839
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,850
What an ingrate.

840
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,840
He teleported to the restaurant

841
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,560
and started

842
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,460
wiping my mouth out of the blue.

843
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,810
And, I even had to apologize to him.

844
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,290
I'm such a dummy.

845
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,640
[She first summoned me]

846
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,440
[when she was stuck on the road.]

847
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,810
[She summoned me for the second time
when she was in danger.]

848
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,040
[But she summoned me for the third time
when she was having a meal.]

849
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,500
[If I didn't help her out,]

850
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,640
[my head would hurt,]

851
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,370
[as if someone was chanting
the Tight Hoop Curse.]

852
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,840
[This is so bizarre.]

853
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,690
[I'm sure there's a pattern]

854
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,350
[that I'm not noticing here.]

855
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,970
[Maybe]

856
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,320
[she was lying to me all along.]

857
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,410
What kind of stupid fairy is this?

858
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,510
Why did she send a devil to aid me?

859
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,670
Not only is he sponging off me,

860
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
but I also have to endure his temper.

861
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,480
How can I live in peace in the future?

862
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,140
That hurts!

863
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,110
I don't even

864
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,090
have a shoulder

865
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,560
to depend on.

866
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,460
Someone, help me out. I'm so pitiful.

867
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,210
You...

868
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,730
What did you hear again?

869
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,540
Don't resort to violence.

870
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,920
We can talk this over.

871
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,240
Don't kill me!

872
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,330
I won't think of anything else!

873
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,250
I'll stop thinking!

874
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,180
I'm begging you!

875
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,770
I'll obey your words!

876
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,280
I...
