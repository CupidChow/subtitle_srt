Why did you have to keep it to yourself?

I'm afraid I would affect your work.

I'm fine, there's no
need to go to the hospital.

36

Seems like you're
really not having a fever.

00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,220
I'll go to work now.

174
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,660
Alright,

175
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,620
don't you worry.

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,090
Okay,

177
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,020
you take good care of yourself

178
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,420
and finish the porridge.

179
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,180
Here, have some more porridge.

180
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,490
It's okay, Aunt Nan.

181
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,300
I'll do it myself.

182
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,370
You're ill severely,

183
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,500
how could I let you do it yourself?

184
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,180
Here, I'll do it.

185
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,890
It's... it's fine.

186
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,020
I can have it myself.

187
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,700
You...

188
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,220
I'll do it myself.

189
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,550
You... you alright?

190
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,470
I'm alright.

191
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,620
Don't rush it.

192
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,660
You finished it?

193
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,460
I'll pour you some more.

194
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,590
It's okay, Aunt Nan.

195
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,690
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

196
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,140
Are you okay?

197
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,340
I'd like to take a nap.

198
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,070
Lie down.

199
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,140
Here.

200
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,660
Cover up nicely.

201
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,960
Take a rest.

202
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Morning, Haitao.

203
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,040
Morning, Nan Xing.

204
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,180
Morning.

205
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,340
Boss.

206
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,020
Why are you here?

207
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,990
I'm waiting for you.

208
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,860
Waiting for me?

209
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,340
Are you again...

210
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,660
Boss, what's wrong with

211
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,190
that friend of yours again?

212
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,420
Didn't you say that

213
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,140
we let them have multi-planned encounters?

214
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,060
This friend of mine actually
did exactly the same.

215
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,420
and date her out

216
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,500
to an art exhibition.

217
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,100
He also expressed

218
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,180
that dating her to the art exhibition

219
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,660
is only because she likes it.

220
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,140
But Miss Ye doesn't seem

221
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,380
to understand what he meant.

222
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,940
Do you think

223
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,180
he should continue dating her?

224
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,460
One moment, Boss.

225
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,860
You asked too many questions.

226
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm not sure

227
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,930
which one to answer.

228
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
You can tell me how you feel about it.

229
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,420
My feeling?

230
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,940
I find it weird.

231
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,720
Two adults, man and woman,

232
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,980
suddenly dated each other

233
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,510
with multiple encounters.

234
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,180
Usually, people would think further right?

235
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
How could Miss Ye not think further?

236
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,270
It's not sudden.

237
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,900
They used to go out
with each other frequently.

238
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,580
What do you mean?

239
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,540
Before Miss Ye

240
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,820
becomes the CEO,

241
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,580
they always go out with each other.

242
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,140
Basically everyday.

243
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,660
It's not like...you guys...

244
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,700
It's all because of work right?

245
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,780
Yes, what's wrong with it?

246
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,500
It's...

247
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,860
You should...

248
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,940
That friend of yours

249
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,660
should think about the problem

250
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,260
from Miss Ye's point of view.

251
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,540
What to think about?

252
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,620
According to what you said,

253
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,380
Miss Ye is someone who's

254
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,100
all time

255
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,740
being in a working mode.

256
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,660
So she must have treated everything

257
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,460
as work.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,620
However,

259
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,140
she must have time off from work, right?

260
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,230
You have a point.

261
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,460
I do.

262
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,740
You do.

263
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,180
I wonder if Xiao Wudi's fever

264
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,240
is gone down or not.

265
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,250
[Young Master Xiao]

266
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,830
Are you feeling better?

267
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,350
Aunt Nan.

268
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,780
Cover up.

269
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm fine now, really.

270
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,780
No.

271
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,860
You were not covering enough.

272
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,100
I don't feel any cold now.

273
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,900
You're cold.

274
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,750
Cover up.

275
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,710
I'll go and get you some warm water.

276
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,550
Thank you, Aunt Nan.

277
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,520
[Young Master Xiao]

278
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,380
Why is Xiao Wudi not replying my WeChat?

279
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,620
[Aunt An]

280
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,220
Why is my mother not picking up the phone?

281
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,020
He won't get sicker, will he?

282
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,860
Nan Xing.

283
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Have you prepared the meeting materials?

284
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,160
I am preparing.

285
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,780
Xiong.

286
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,660
You're inside for half an hour.

287
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,390
Are you okay?

288
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,410
Aunt Nan, I'm alright.

289
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,740
You...

290
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,950
Then are you going to stay any longer?

291
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,260
I probably still

292
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,540
need a little longer.

293
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,830
I know what to do.

294
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,300
Xiong.

295
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,140
Yes, Aunt Nan.

296
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,300
I'll give you something.

297
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,760
It will be helpful.

298
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,620
So that's about it for

299
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,900
our book signing schedule

300
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,230
in recent three months.

301
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,099
Yufan,

302
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,770
you're responsible for

303
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,180
connecting with our local partners

304
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,859
handling the itinerary

305
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,540
and venue, things like that.

306
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,069
Alright.

307
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,020
Nan Xing,

308
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,380
Boss's hotel and flight ticket bookings

309
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,099
will be
your responsibility this time, okay?

310
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:35,740
Okay.

311
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,780
That's all.

312
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,500
Dismiss, off work.

313
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,610
What's going on with her?

314
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,740
You're back.

315
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,620
Mother, why are you here?

316
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,380
Where else should I be?

317
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,500
Why aren't you taking care of Xiong?

318
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,900
He's recovered already.

319
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,290
So soon?

320
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,150
He recovered in the afternoon.

321
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,940
It's working.

322
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,300
What are you cooking?

323
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm cooking some porridge for Xiong.

324
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,900
Coincidentally,

325
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,760
I also came back

326
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,080
to make him something.

327
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,410
You didn't add in any

328
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,060
weird ingredients, did you?

329
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,860
I'm not being innovative today.

330
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,940
For a sick person,

331
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,090
we better not.

332
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,540
Good then.

333
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,580
But we could still add in some vegetables

334
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,700
and some meats.

335
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,220
I'll wash some cabbage.

336
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,750
Alright.

337
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,390
This illness will not recover
if it remains any longer.

338
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,350
Are you really okay now?

339
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,770
Yes, I am.

340
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,100
My mother is really good.

341
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,150
She cooked you some porridge,

342
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,200
and I cooked you

343
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,460
two fried eggs.

344
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,740
Thank you.

345
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,030
I'm here to check on you.

346
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,820
You've recovered and I'm not worried now.

347
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,940
I'll go now then.

348
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,620
Seems like I need another trick.

349
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,820
I really don't know how to keep writing.

350
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,100
Or,

351
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,580
I'm simply not suitable
for original writing.

352
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,380
Power cut?

353
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,340
I don't know.

354
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,020
Do you have power in your room?

355
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,260
No.

356
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,800
What's happening?

357
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,750
I don't know.

358
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,020
I'll go check out the electricity meter.

359
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,100
What's going on?

360
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm not sure.

361
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,700
It didn't trip.

362
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,620
We didn't owe any bills.

363
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,540
You see, the lights are still on

364
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,660
in other houses.

365
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,400
I'll go find

366
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,740
the number for electricity company

367
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
and call them up.

368
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,390
Alright.

369
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,740
You scared me.

370
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,880
What's wrong with you?

371
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,780
What are you doing here?

372
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,780
-What's the matter?
-I'm...

373
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,860
Nan Xing, are you okay?

374
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,780
Who are you?

375
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,350
Madam An.

376
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,050
Xiong?

377
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,900
You...

378
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,780
I just got back from shopping.

379
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,100
The power is cut here?

380
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,500
Yes.

381
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,260
We don't know the cause.

382
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,990
Do you have power at your place?

383
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,280
Let me check it out.

384
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,700
No power.

385
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
That's weird.

386
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,060
Why is there no power only in our house?

387
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,900
It's probably circuit failure.

388
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,740
Such issue

389
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,340
couldn't be fixed anytime soon.

390
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,940
Plus it's quite late now.

391
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
There shouldn't be
any technician available.

392
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,340
Why don't you guys stay over my place

393
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
for a night?

394
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,560
-Alright.
-It's not too good, right?

395
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,300
There's no other way.

396
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,140
At this hour,

397
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,300
we can't even shower without power.

398
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,470
I think tonight

399
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,490
we'll have to settle down here

400
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,490
at Xiong's place.

401
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,940
I'll go

402
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,820
pack up some daily necessities.

403
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,460
This bear...

404
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
It's cute, right?

405
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,580
The hairline is too high up,

406
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,380
too distant between eyes,

407
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,180
too big of a tummy,

408
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,940
how is it cute?

409
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,980
Not as handsome as Xiong.

410
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,510
Not cute.

411
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,940
How cute.

412
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,900
Your aesthetic view

413
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,420
really doesn't fit mine.

414
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,740
You're obviously not
my biological daughter.

415
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,650
How could you say that to me?

416
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,220
Don't cry.

417
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,340
I take it back.

418
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,740
Our connection is stronger than bloodline.

419
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,620
That's enough, mother.

420
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,140
Done.

421
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,060
Aunt Nan.

422
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,980
The room is cleaned and ready.

423
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,220
Tonight, you guys can

424
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,020
settle here.

425
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,300
I apologize, Xiong.

426
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,660
You just recovered from illness

427
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,900
and you're taking care of us.

428
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,810
Sorry for the inconvenience.

429
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,580
It's alright.

430
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,020
This is what I'm supposed to do.

431
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,080
As the saying goes,

432
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,940
a close neighbour is better
than a distant relative.

433
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,540
Also,

434
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,900
this is your own place.

435
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,560
You can stay as long as you want

436
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,860
You're quite generous.

437
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,590
Are you the one paying the rent?

438
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,300
What rental?

439
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,300
The rent for the second half of the year.

440
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,780
What are you in a hurry for then?

441
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,840
It's empty anyway.

442
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,180
You can let Xiong stay.

443
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,420
Xiong,

444
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,380
if she urges you for the rental again,

445
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:09,940
you can tell me.

446
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,340
I'll be in charge for you.

447
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,870
Thank you, Aunt Nan.

448
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,220
By the way,

449
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,260
I just got the hot water ready.

450
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,680
Aunt Nan, do you want to

451
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,660
shower first?

452
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,660
I'm not tired.

453
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm not even tired.

454
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,940
It's not even late yet,
I'm not sleepy at all.

455
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,780
[Not tired?]

456
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,060
[How could I be alone with]

457
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,770
[Nan Xing then?]

458
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,820
One, two, three.

459
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,160
Finally, all three of us get together.

460
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,020
Let's play "Fight the Landlord".

461
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,060
Sure.

462
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,800
I think I don't have poker cards here.

463
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,940
I do.

464
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,820
Are you ready?

465
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm getting the landlord.

466
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm getting it, I'm calling it.

467
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,660
Landlord.

468
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,060
Are your cards that good?

469
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,960
These cards...

470
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,420
Do you regret now?

471
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,940
My cards are too good.

472
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,580
Do you want it?

473
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,500
He can't take it.

474
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,530
Because the "Big Cat" card is with me.

475
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,700
Arrogant.

476
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,240
Are you kidding me?

477
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,260
Paired Two.

478
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,740
Paired King.

479
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,740
What cards do you have? Let me see.

480
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,470
Sticker strip, sticker strip.

481
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,020
Here.

482
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,420
Done.

483
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,220
Mother has to get one too.

484
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,420
Me too?

485
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,590
You lost as well.

486
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,580
You guys are a team now.

487
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,490
Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

488
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,530
Boom!

489
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,980
One last card, four.

490
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,780
I won!

491
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,410
I...

492
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,860
I'm left with three cards.

493
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,620
Nine.

494
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,180
Play the card.

495
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,980
Do you want it?

496
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,380
Burst with the King card.

497
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,060
I won again.

498
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,420
Don't let it fall.

499
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,480
Each fallen one gets another ten.

500
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,660
Burst with the King card!

501
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,100
We won again!

502
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,330
We won again!

503
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,780
I'll shuffle the cards.

504
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,310
Hand it over, I'll shuffle.

505
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,140
It's too fun.

506
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,100
Let's shuffle.

507
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,840
We should play this everyday.

508
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,180
It's fine.

509
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,820
Staying here onwards

510
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,860
means

511
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,960
there will be more time together.

512
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,440
By then, making her

513
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,980
do everything with me

514
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,500
will be easy, won't it?

515
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,940
You're awake, Aunt Nan.

516
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,740
Xiong,

517
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,460
you did all these?

518
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,980
Have a seat, Aunt Nan.

519
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,500
You're too good.

520
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,540
Nan Xing.

521
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,620
Come here, Nan Xing.

522
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,620
Look.

523
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,760
You made these?

524
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,420
Of course, not.

525
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,780
It's all done by Xiong.

526
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,340
Xiong, it's really a surprise

527
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,540
that you're so good at cooking.

528
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,780
It's still far worse compared to

529
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,910
Aunt Nan's cooking.

530
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,900
Now that's a little bit overblown.

531
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,210
How is it overblown?

532
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,090
I wake up early everyday,

533
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,480
to make you meals...

534
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,140
Yes.

535
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,320
I know, mother.

536
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,130
Let me get you a bowl of porridge.

537
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,420
Forgive you then.

538
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,500
Xiong,

539
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,460
we don't wake up so early tomorrow.

540
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,480
You went out of your way for this,

541
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,120
and end up getting so exhausted.

542
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,980
And you don't even get a thank you.

543
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,010
We wouldn't need him tomorrow.

544
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,900
We will go back tomorrow.

545
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,860
In the afternoon,

546
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,960
I will call the man
from electricity company

547
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,380
to come fix the circuit.

548
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,570
So hurry?

549
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,410
Or else?

550
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,340
We can't keep staying over here.

551
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,700
Why not?

552
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,420
Isn't this pretty good?

553
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,420
I don't have an opinion.
I'm okay for anything.

554
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,610
Nan Xing,

555
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,700
go check later

556
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,220
about the recent movies.

557
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,660
There's a recent one,

558
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,650
a very good romance movie.

559
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,620
Would you like to watch it?

560
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,260
Sure.

561
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,370
Check the weekend,

562
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,320
and see if there is any suitable venue for us.

563
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,850
Alright.

564
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,340
I've checked completely on this side.

565
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,540
No issue found.

566
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,630
We'll check again outside.

567
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,140
Okay.

568
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,320
Then what has actually happened?

569
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,900
I couldn't find the issue.

570
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,060
What's actually causing

571
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,420
the power cut then?

572
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,990
I'm not sure either.

573
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,900
I've never encountered such situation.

574
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,780
If it still doesn't work,

575
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
I'll have to dismantle the circuit.

576
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,100
Dismantle the circuit?

577
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,060
Does that mean we have
to smash open the wall?

578
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,420
It's too troublesome.

579
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,020
There's no other way.

580
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,340
I leave you with no option.

581
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,300
You are to be without option.

582
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,300
It's quite late now, I'll have to go.

583
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,180
I'll be back tomorrow.

584
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,580
Okay.

585
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,700
Thank you.

586
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,780
How was it, Aunt Nan?

587
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,660
Xiong.

588
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,300
We still can't find out the cause.

589
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,430
The technician said

590
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,500
if it still doesn't work,

591
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,780
we'll have to smash the wall open

592
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,180
and rebuild the circuit.

593
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,280
That troublesome?

594
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,180
Mother.

595
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,580
You're back.

596
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,220
We're smashing the wall open?

597
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,750
We couldn't find the cause.

598
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,780
How about

599
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,740
I call the electricity company

600
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
tomorrow

601
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,340
and request

602
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,600
a new technician over?

603
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
If we're demolishing the wall,

604
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,340
how long would it take?

605
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,060
It's useless.

606
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,710
This issue could not be solved so quickly.

607
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,500
I know it.

608
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,020
Moreover,

609
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,060
isn't it fine

610
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,460
staying at my place?

611
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,060
You guys need not think too much.

612
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,580
Make yourselves at home.

613
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,540
That is our house.

614
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,980
That's right.

615
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,580
It's the same.

616
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,500
Let's eat.

617
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,340
Mother.

618
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,100
Which movie time slot do your prefer?

619
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm buying the tickets.

620
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,170
I've watched that movie.

621
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,980
Don't buy it.

622
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
Xiong helped me bought the tickets.

623
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,340
Here, I'll do it, Aunt Nan.

624
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,820
Okay.

625
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,140
You must watch it.

626
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,270
I'm sure you would like this movie.

627
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,910
Alright.

628
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,620
Let me check out

629
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,540
one last dish.

630
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,080
You helped my mother bought the tickets?

631
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,360
Today, I

632
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,280
wanted to try the digital wallet.

633
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,540
So I tested with buying
the tickets for Aunt Nan.

634
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,900
How did you get the internet money?

635
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,710
I used yours.

636
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,900
That's why I wonder

637
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,300
how is there a credit today.

638
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,460
I'll find Sisi then.

639
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,790
She watched it.

640
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,780
How about I watch it with you?

641
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,860
I haven't watched any movie

642
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,260
after I came here anyway.

643
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,180
You're not

644
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,740
plotting for something again, are you?

645
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,660
What am I plotting?

646
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,140
What can I get from

647
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,020
watching a movie with you?

648
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,980
I wanted to

649
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,620
ask you to watch with me too.

650
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,780
But I thought

651
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,580
you wouldn't like this kind of movie.

652
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,060
Never try never know.

653
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,140
Let's watch together then.

654
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,260
How can I help you?

655
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,400
One set of popcorn.

656
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:53,860

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,140
[Writing novel?]

860
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,380
[If I could help her on this...]

861
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,700
Nan Xing,

862
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,220
do you think that

863
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,650
your brain is not that good?

864
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,100
Why do you say so?

865
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,100
Let me put it this way.

866
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,620
Do you think

867
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,910
that you're not that good in thinking?

868
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,730
Since you were young,

869
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,210
you've thought about a lot of things.

870
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,740
Did you achieve any of them?

871
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,900
Now that you know
thinking isn't your strength,

872
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,220
stop thinking too much then.

873
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,380
Just do it.

874
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,130
You have a point.

875
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,620
Good or bad,

876
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,860
it will only reveal
after I finish writing.

877
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,060
That's right.

878
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
I support you.

879
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,020
But I still don't know

880
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,380
what to write.

881
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,980
I told you you're not good in thinking.

882
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,820
It's true.

883
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
The topic is already

884
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,700
right in front of you.

885
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,260
What topic?

886
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,060
The things between us.

887
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,150
Aren't they worth writing?

888
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,100
[I want an]

889
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,750
[unforgettable love too.]

890
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,340
[What's going on?]

891
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,460
[Doesn't this scenario]

892
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,210
[only happen in novel?]

893
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,020
[Couldn't get my heart.]

894
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,610
[Getting me is still good right?]

895
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,020
No!

896
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,140
[Before you send me back,]

897
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,910
[I can only sleep with you]

898
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,220
[every single night.]

899
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,460
I...

900
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,020
Didn't I told you

901
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,260
not to bother me?

902
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,820
Put me down.

903
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,390
[That's right.]

904
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,100
[I could write such a story.]

905
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,380
You're right!

906
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,420
The story between us

907
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,500
is literally more novel than novel.

908
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,230
Alright, I'll write this then.

909
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
Xiao Wudi, you're amazing!

910
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,060
Fantastic!

911
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,920
I'll get back to write right away.

912
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,580
[Broken circuit trick]

913
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,220
[isn't a long term plan.]

914
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,100
[Even if we]

915
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,180
[don't stay together,]

916
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,580
[you will still need
to see me frequently.]

917
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,220
Let's go, Xiao Wudi.

918
