1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Stay with me

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You are the destiny that never changes

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Come for me

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Stay with me

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Once you look back, you fill my heart

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be with me

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 10

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Come in

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Boss, I'm here to see you

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So fast

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You two

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are you thinking about?

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's wrong?

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You just said I was fooling around

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
after a few days

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I asked you to do

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
what you like

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I'm here

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You don't understand

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I mean what you really want to do

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't be kidnapped by this company

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and my dream

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I thought you understood

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you like being my assistant?

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, Zichen

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't be so stubborn

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You want to be an assistant?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How can an assistant talk to the boss like that?

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're not going to be an assistant now

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm not leaving

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I just signed the contract

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Can I pay you the penalty?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Zichen

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Didn't you tell me before

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to do what I like?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've thought about it

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I like the life here

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You must be in my world

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I thought you didn't like me

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I stayed with you

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
because I liked you

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go on

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
why didn't you tell me before?

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Maybe I was afraid of being rejected

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
so I rejected myself first

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're the same

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not a girl

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We were so stupid back then

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Can we forgive each other

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and give ourselves a chance?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know how to answer you

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know if I promised you

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
whether it's right or not

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's okay

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not going anywhere this time

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have time

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's start

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You've been talking for so long

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How's it going?

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're not going to catch up with me anyway

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Xiaodi

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Xiaodi

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're not at home?

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I won't share it with you

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mom

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're at home

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The light in my room is off

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm going to sleep

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Xiaodi

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you dressed like this?

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is what aunt An asked me to find

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And yours

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you going to do?

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I want to cure your disease before I leave

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm fine

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You fainted and you're fine

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nanxin

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You want to be strong

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You want to be brave

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You don't want to show your sadness in front of us

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But have you ever thought about it?

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I see you like this

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How can I leave without worrying?

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Didn't we agree not to think about it?

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And even if you want to do psychological treatment for me

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You don't have to dress like this

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm just a situation

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Believe me, okay?

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Xiaodi

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Xiaodi

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Wang Xiaodi, wait for me

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Xiaodi

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You have something to tell me

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mao Xiaojun, wait for me

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Qiao, why are you here?

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm wearing headphones, not an eye mask

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can't you see you started to faint from the bus stop?

103
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mao Xiaojun

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Aunt An

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm here to ask Mao Xiaojun about math

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Xiaojun, talk to him

107
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He will definitely talk to me

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Are you asking for homework or looking for a pen?

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm being hit by your head every day

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm so stupid

111
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Please tell me about it

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll send you a supper later

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, I can eat it again

114
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me put it down

115
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll go and get the firewood

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, Mao Xiaojun

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Mao Xiaojun, I'm sorry

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I shouldn't have liked you so much

119
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If I didn't ask you to send me supper

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You wouldn't have come to save me

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You wouldn't have died

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It would be great if I didn't like you

123
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If I was the one who died

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I wouldn't have been able to save you

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Silly

127
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If you were the one who died

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
She would be very sad too

129
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because she likes you too, stupid

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
She liked you since she was little

131
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She has always liked you

132
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
She likes you now too

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But she was just like you

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She was just a child

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So she didn't dare to open her heart to you

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In her dream

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
She told me all her feelings

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Nanxin

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You have to know

140
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You don't like her on purpose

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
She likes you too

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So you sacrifice yourself for the one you like

143
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't worry, wait for me

144
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's her choice

145
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Now I'm doing all this

146
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is also my choice

147
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry

149
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry

152
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry

153
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry

154
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry

156
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry

158
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry

160
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry

162
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sorry

163
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sorry

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Seems fine

165
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,600
Little Fifth Brother, thank you.

166
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,320
I love you, Little Fifth Brother!

167
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,240
Little Fifth Brother!

168
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,560
Little Fifth Brother!

169
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,340
Sorry,едное

170
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,440
It's over

171
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,280
Sorry

172
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,260
We을d sever his примерно

173
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,660
and make up for his old regrets

174
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
This is my mission, right?

175
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Yes

176
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Then my mission is completed

177
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Yes

178
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
I should disappear too

179
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Absolutely

180
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
I never begged anyone in my life

181
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
But after I disappeared

182
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
I want you to do me a favor

183
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
I want to know

184
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
what I should do

185
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
to help you

186
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
After I leave

187
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
if he still hurts like before

188
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
find another person for me

189
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Find someone to accompany him

190
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
and cure him

191
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
But this time

192
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660
don't find a traitor like me

193
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
I want to help you

194
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
find a traitor like me

195
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Find him a big hero

196
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
What?

197
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
You think you are a traitor too?

198
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Don't you?

199
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Let me ask you

200
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Is your life world

201
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,660
the same as what is written in the male-dominated book?

202
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
It's a little different

203
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
But

204
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
the author is a man

205
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,660
He is so small

206
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
How can I explain it?

207
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,660
This thing

208
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
should be talked about more than ten years ago

209
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
You can see

210
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
I

211
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
have a lively personality

212
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
For so many years

213
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
I have caused myself

214
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,660
many troubles

215
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
What quality?

216
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Uncle

217
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
How did you get in?

218
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
But the most troublesome thing is

219
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,660
that Mao Xiaojun

220
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Well

221
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
You give me your candy

222
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
I'll tell you, okay?

223
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Actually

224
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
it's very simple

225
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Because uncle is an adult

226
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
When you grow up

227
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
you can practice more and throw it in

228
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
You are a liar

229
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
You don't like to lie

230
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
You even don't like to find his snacks

231
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
How can I lie to you about snacks?

232
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Isn't this

233
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
what you gave me?

234
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
You said I gave you this

235
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
You just answered my question

236
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
But your answer is to lie to me

237
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
Isn't this just stealing?

238
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
I'll give it back to you, okay?

239
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,660
How can I return it to me if I can't eat it?

240
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Give me money

241
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Okay

242
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
This is for you

243
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
How can I spend it?

244
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
I tell you

245
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
I'll make a wish for you later

246
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
If it comes true

247
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
then you can't tell anyone about it

248
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Okay?

249
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
I can make any wish

250
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,660
I'll make a wish for you

251
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
What wish can a child make?

252
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
A toy gun?

253
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
A robot?

254
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,660
I want to protect Sister Four

255
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
and make her happy for the rest of her life

256
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
Oh, no

257
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
You brat

258
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Can you make a wish?

259
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Take it

260
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,660
Make a wish again

261
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Hurry up

262
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
I can't make a wish

263
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
For the rest of your life

264
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
You'll regret it

265
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,660
I won't

266
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Goodbye, Uncle

267
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Who is Sister Four?

268
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,660
How much does she like this Sister Four?

269
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
I didn't expect that

270
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,660
a child can make such a wish

271
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Dad, I'm going to school

272
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
Dad, I'm going to school

273
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
An Xiaoqi

274
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Wait for me

275
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,660
I thought it was a joke

276
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
What's so good about that guy?

277
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,660
I thought that

278
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
when Mao Xiaojun gets older

279
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,660
and sees more girls

280
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
he might not

281
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
care about men so much

282
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
and this wish will be granted

283
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
But who knows

284
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
the sky is not clear

285
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm sorry

286
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
I'm sorry

287
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
I'm sorry

288
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
I'm sorry

289
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
I'm sorry

290
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm sorry

291
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
I'm sorry

292
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
I'm sorry

293
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I'm sorry

294
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
I'm sorry

295
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm sorry

296
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I'm sorry

297
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
I'm sorry

298
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm sorry

299
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I'm sorry

300
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,660
I'm sorry

301
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
I'm sorry

302
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm sorry

303
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
I'm sorry

304
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,660
I'm sorry

305
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
I'm sorry

306
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
I'm sorry

307
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm sorry

308
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm sorry

309
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm sorry

310
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
I'm sorry

311
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
I'm sorry

312
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
I'm sorry

313
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
I'm sorry

314
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
I'm sorry

315
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
I'm sorry

316
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,660
What's this for?

317
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Why are you wearing it every day?

318
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
I want to protect her forever.

319
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
Let her be happy.

320
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Open your eyes.

321
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Listen to the song.

322
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Until the moment Mao Xiaojun died,

323
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
she didn't give up on her wish.

324
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,660
China looks to the end of nightmare.

325
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,660
How can dreams be solved?

326
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
The world is so big.

327
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
The world is so big.

328
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,660
How can dreams be solved?

329
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Waiting for yearning to go again.

330
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,660
The yearning to be a car.

331
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,660
The moment I wake up.

332
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
I want to go to the washroom.

333
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
The heart beats.

334
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,660
Let the story over the world.

335
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Trying to show you everything will be great.

336
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,660
So, all these years,

337
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I've been trying to make Nanxing happy.

338
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,660
But Nanxing is too sad.

339
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
I have to wait.

340
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Finally, I have a chance.

341
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
What's so great about love?

342
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,660
If I can fall in love, I want to fall in love, too.

343
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,660
I want to meet a love that is hard to be a star.

344
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,660
A love that is hard to be a star.

345
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,660
But why do you choose me?

346
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Look at it yourself.

347
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
This is Mao Xiaoxun's book.

348
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,660
So I was created by Mao Xiaoxun.

349
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
I'm not a fool.

350
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,660
I'm just an ordinary man.

351
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
He wrote me.

352
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Mao Xiaoxun has liked tears since childhood.

353
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Ah, that is Nanxing.

354
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,540
So he created the hero Xiao Wu Di

355
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,500
to protect Nanjing.

356
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,860
It can be said that

357
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,140
you have the ability that Mao Xiaojun wants to have

358
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,140
but can't have.

359
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,740
After he died,

360
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,900
you inherited his thoughts and feelings.

361
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,700
Now you are the ideal self of Mao Xiaojun.

362
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,180
Okay.

363
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,900
Xiao Wu Di,

364
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,020
congratulations.

365
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,780
You passed the last test.

366
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,020
Test?

367
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,780
Didn't you say I would disappear?

368
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,740
Yes.

369
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,460
The young master He Huan, Xiao Wu Di,

370
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,780
has disappeared.

371
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,180
Xiao Wu Di.

372
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,540
You are back.

373
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,740
Nanjing.

374
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,500
I thought you wouldn't come back.

375
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,820
Nanjing.

376
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,820
I just met the fairy.

377
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,700
She told me that I passed the test.

378
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,700
She also said that the young master He Huan

379
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,540
disappeared from the world.

380
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,620
Look.

381
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,540
Isn't this the book of Mao Xiaojun?

382
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,380
Why is it in your hand?

383
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,060
The fairy gave it to me.

384
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,380
She said this is my original world.

385
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,900
I remember it.

386
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,060
I mentioned the name Xiao Wu Di

387
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,580
to Mao Xiaojun.

388
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,820
I didn't expect that

389
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,820
she wrote so much.

390
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,340
So you are...

391
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
So I'm not your character.

392
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,780
I'm the character created by Mao Xiaojun.

393
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,980
She has always been in love with you.

394
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,740
You don't need to go back?

395
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,900
The fairy told me

396
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,900
that every day I go back

397
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,340
may be the last day.

398
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,020
She wants you to cherish me.

399
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,900
Otherwise, she...

400
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,580
Chief Xiao.

401
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,260
I've revised the contract before the accommodation.

402
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,300
I need to re-release it.

403
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,380
The venue is confirmed.

404
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,580
Okay.

405
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,180
Sister Jiajia.

406
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,460
The boss's trip next week.

407
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,860
Mr. Ye.

408
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,860
You work here.

409
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,260
We are not used to it.

410
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,100
Just call me Xiao Ye.

411
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,740
I have a meeting

412
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,420
to talk to Brother Haitao.

413
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,940
By the way,

414
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,260
please take care of the work

415
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,700
that needs to be done with Sister Shanshan.

416
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,660
Okay, no problem.

417
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,460
The director said

418
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,340
the problem of the extension version

419
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,700
is not good.

420
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,220
I think we need to

421
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,180
think about it.

422
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,660
No problem.

423
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,220
Mr. Lu.

424
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,260
Mr. Lu.

425
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,140
Mr. Lu.

426
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,100
Mr. Lu.

427
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,100
Come in.

428
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,860
Mr. Lu.

429
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,740
Thank you.

430
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,220
Steamed dumplings?

431
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,100
Yes.

432
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,180
The boss prepared it for you.

433
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,900
I didn't know

434
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,340
he was so kind.

435
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,340
If you don't need anything else,

436
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,220
I'll go out first.

437
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,340
Wait.

438
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,100
Do you want tea?

439
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,020
Do you want the kids

440
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,980
at the door to give you another cup?

441
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,740
No, Mr. Lu.

442
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,660
You can say it directly.

443
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,300
Didn't you leave before?

444
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,300
Why did you come back suddenly?

445
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,980
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

446
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,060
This is my personal problem with the boss.

447
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,260
It's not easy to answer

448
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,300
when it comes to privacy.

449
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,100
Please understand.

450
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,740
Thank you.

451
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,740
Do you remember

452
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,740
our previous agreement?

453
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,580
Yes.

454
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,140
If I fall in love with Zichen,

455
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,060
you will withdraw your salary from the company.

456
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:37,940
Have you been happy

457
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,220
for so many years?

458
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,460
Not really.

459
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,820
But I was not convinced at that time.

460
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,660
You were not convinced at that time.

461
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,540
What about now?

462
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,660
Now you have withdrawn your salary from the company.

463
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,500
But we didn't fall apart.

464
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,580
Where are they?

465
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,100
In your office.

466
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,940
Is it interesting?

467
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,780
Mr. Lu.

468
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,100
You are a social celebrity.

469
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,860
Don't threaten the girls.

470
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,540
Why do you come to me?

471
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,580
I am here to tell you.

472
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,660
I want to be with Ye Qin.

473
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,620
What else can you do?

474
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,580
You can show it.

475
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,220
I will never let her go again.

476
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,060
This is my answer.

477
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,820
What attitude?

478
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,700
How can you talk to the boss?

479
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,340
How can you talk to the boss?

480
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,500
We will make this company better and better.

481
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,180
One day it will surpass you.

482
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,740
The tea is good.

483
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,940
Thank you.

484
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,020
What are you looking at?

485
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,580
The company has such a good tea.

486
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,020
You don't know to give me some.

487
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,620
You are not good.

488
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,780
Don't give it to my company.

489
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,540
Give it to my family.

490
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,420
Okay.

491
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,300
What did he just say?

492
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,620
Actually...

493
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,900
I am flate the date at that time.

494
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,420
Also didn't match it for you.

495
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,660
There's an old saying.

496
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,340
Nine cubes в tons, Mexican.

497
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,020
However, I don't know how are to treat

498
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,060
it in such a way.

499
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,260
is the most suitable.

500
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,460
So...

501
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,940
Actually, I understand you.

502
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,780
You always think that Zichen is weak

503
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,180
and easily fooled.

504
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,060
So you made that request

505
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,660
to test us.

506
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,460
But I don't think you know him well.

507
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,100
He is much stronger than you think.

508
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,660
Don't be so harsh.

509
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,460
You should save some face for him.

510
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,220
It doesn't matter what he says.

511
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,900
What you say is the most important.

512
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,660
You were impulsive just now, right?

513
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,740
Impulsive?

514
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,900
Can I regret it?

515
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,380
Of course not.

516
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,100
I read the novel.

517
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,740
I was touched.

518
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,940
Ma Leng told Su Yu that

519
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,260
he loved this world.

520
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
He wanted to make it go around every corner.

521
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,660
I love this world, too, like Su Yu.

522
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,860
But I can't live without you.

523
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,660
You were impulsive just now.

524
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,060
I'm sorry.

525
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,460
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,860
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
I'm sorry.

529
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm sorry.

530
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,660
I'm sorry.

531
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,060
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,460
I'm sorry.

533
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
I'm sorry.

535
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,060
I'm sorry.

536
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,260
I was impulsive just now.

537
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,660
I should have told you from the beginning.

538
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Indeed.

539
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Whatever it is, it's my fault.

540
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
It has nothing to do with Nanxing.

541
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,660
Mom.

542
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Shut up.

543
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
So,

544
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Xiao Xiong is just like us.

545
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
He is a modern man.

546
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,660
I...

547
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Let me see if it's real.

548
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
Of course it's real.

549
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
It really hurts.

550
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,660
It has temperature.

551
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
It's a human.

552
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
I'm a human, aunt.

553
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
So, besides martial arts,

554
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,660
do you have any other bad reactions?

555
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Will you suddenly call back?

556
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
I won't go back this time, aunt.

557
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
I will...

558
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
I will stay here with Nanxing.

559
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Really?

560
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Really.

561
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,660
Then you swear that you will never leave Nanxing.

562
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
I swear.

563
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,660
I will never leave Nanxing.

564
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
I will stay by her side,

565
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
take care of her, and accompany her.

566
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,660
That's more like it.

567
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
Mom, don't you object to us?

568
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,660
I have never objected to you, okay?

569
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
You two are so mysterious every day.

570
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,660
You don't tell me anything.

571
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
You keep it from me.

572
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,660
How have I ever seen such a strange thing?

573
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,660
But I think Xiong really wants to cure your fear of obstacles.

574
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
He really wants to be with you.

575
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,660
I'm just worried.

576
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
I was worried about it before.

577
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
Don't mind it, Xiong.

578
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
What are you talking about, aunt?

579
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
You are right.

580
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
If I were you, I would choose like this.

581
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
I knew you would understand me.

582
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,660
Mom, be gentle.

583
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
You are still protecting her.

584
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,660
But...

585
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
But what?

586
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,660
If you two get married and have children,

587
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
how can you get into the household registration?

588
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,660
You can get into my household registration.

589
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,660
We have already made the registration.

590
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,660
How can she get into the household registration?

591
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,660
How can she get into the household registration?

592
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Aunt.

593
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,660
This is so handsome.

594
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,660
This is definitely the most handsome certificate I have ever seen.

595
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Thank you, aunt.

596
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,660
If you two have children,

597
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
you will definitely be very handsome.

598
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
If it's a girl,

599
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
like Xiong,

600
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,660
look at her face.

601
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
And she is fair, right?

602
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,660
She has such a good skin.

603
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
Isn't she a boy?

604
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Like mom.

605
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Like our Nanxing.

606
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
She has long eyelashes and thick eyebrows.

607
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
How handsome she is.

608
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Okay.

609
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Let's plan the next step.

610
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
What next step?

611
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
Life.
