1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
I'm getting ready.

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,520
I don't want to stay.

3
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,860
I don't want to beÅŸaot the

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,860
The Love by Hypnotic

5
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,860
The Love by Hypnotic

6
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,860
Episode 2

7
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,860
Why am I like this again?

8
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Sleep, kick the quilt, and turn around.

9
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,860
Why am I like this?

10
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
So that was him.

11
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,860
I'm not sleeping.

12
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
Xiaodi!

13
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
The door is not locked. Come in.

14
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,860
You two are...

15
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,860
President Lu said he was dizzy in the morning.

16
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,860
What can I do?

17
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
His pillow is too low.

18
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
He lost sleep last night.

19
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,860
It's easy for me to have hypnosis.

20
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,860
And then I ran into him.

21
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,860
What a bad luck.

22
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,860
You made all this?

23
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
You deserve it.

24
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,860
This weekend, I want to go to see my dad.

25
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Do you want to go with me?

26
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Go?

27
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Okay, let's go together.

28
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,860
Together.

29
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Have you two been like this?

30
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,860
What's wrong?

31
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
Nothing.

32
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Now there are writers who are willing to work for their roles.

33
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
I'm one of them.

34
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,860
It's good.

35
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,860
But I don't know about us.

36
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,860
What did you say?

37
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
We...

38
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,860
Lanxin, my girlfriend.

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Yes.

40
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,860
Boss, hurry up.

41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
We have to go to the company later.

42
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
Come.

43
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,860
All the related output information of the new project has been sorted.

44
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,860
The interview will be released together when it is on the line.

45
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
They are all newbies.

46
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
They have no influence on the market.

47
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
So we need to be careful when promoting.

48
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
We have arranged the promotion of various channels.

49
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
There are some public accounts that are hard to make an appointment.

50
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,860
I've already sent the clip over.

51
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Let them read it in advance.

52
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
The feedback is good.

53
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,580
When we are on the line, the

54
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
feedback will be made one by one.

55
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,860
Boss, some platforms have already found us in advance.

56
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,860
They want to get the extension rights of our novels first.

57
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
We can put this aside.

58
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,860
We will discuss it after we are on the line.

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,860
Okay.

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Then we will go first.

61
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,860
This way.

62
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I will write something later.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Don't bother me if there is nothing else.

64
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
I won't bother you.

65
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
But you need to check these two contracts.

66
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,860
When you finish reading, remember to give me a reply.

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
Who was in charge of these projects before?

68
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Why is it so complicated?

69
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
It's Mr. Ye.

70
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
I will finish reading tonight.

71
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,860
I will give it to you tomorrow.

72
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
You don't have time tonight.

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
You need to meet a producer tonight.

74
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
This was Mr. Ye's schedule before.

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Now it's your turn.

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Can these projects be completed on time before Mr. Ye?

77
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
He finished them in advance.

78
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Every time he comes,

79
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
things are already prepared.

80
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
And he will arrange the next proposal.

81
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
You can finish reading these two first.

82
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
You can read the previous one tomorrow.

83
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,860
I

84
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,860
am really childish, right?

85
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Yes.

86
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Hello?

87
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Are you free this afternoon?

88
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
I am here to see you.

89
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Hello, auntie and uncle.

90
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
Xiao Lu is here.

91
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Looking for Qin Qian?

92
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Qin Qian.

93
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Wait for me.

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
Okay, okay. Give it to me.

95
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
Dad.

96
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
I am here.

97
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
I am here.

98
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
I am here.

99
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
I am here.

100
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
I am here.

101
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
I am here.

102
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I am here.

103
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
I am here.

104
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Dad, mom, I am going to the bathroom.

105
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Okay, go ahead.

106
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Okay.

107
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
Thank you.

108
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
I am sorry.

109
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,860
I said I would spend my birthday with you every year.

110
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
But it has been delayed until now.

111
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
It is not too late to go now.

112
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Shouldn't you meet a producer tonight?

113
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Isn't it too late now?

114
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
You have a good memory.

115
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,860
How long did you do the mark for the contract?

116
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
One night.

117
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
One night?

118
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
You are really amazing.

119
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
What?

120
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Are you here to give me a speech today?

121
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Almost.

122
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Didn't you ask about my dad before?

123
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,860
Actually, I have thought it through.

124
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,860
I think it is time for me to be truly independent.

125
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,860
I was angry with you at that time.

126
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
I am sorry.

127
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,860
Where do you live now?

128
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
I live in the city of Beijing.

129
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Next door to the men's house.

130
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
With Xiao Wu Di.

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
How can that be?

132
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I will help you find a...

133
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
No need.

134
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
I am not here to seek help.

135
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Actually, I have thought about it a lot these days.

136
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
I think you are right.

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,860
I have never thought about many things.

138
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,860
I have never noticed your hard work over the past years.

139
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,860
I found out after I took over your job.

140
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,860
I realized that I would make things more complicated...

141
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
every time I was willful.

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,860
I thought that as long as I expressed my feelings...

143
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
we could get closer.

144
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
But I didn't expect that...

145
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I would give you more pressure...

146
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
if I was more willful.

147
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,860
So, I am here to tell you...

148
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,860
that I will not tell you about the company anymore.

149
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Don't feel responsible for me.

150
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I have never blamed you.

151
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
You should blame me.

152
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
And you should spend more time on yourself.

153
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Do what you really like.

154
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Do you have time?

155
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Let's take a few more rounds.

156
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Are you okay?

157
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
Yes.

158
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
You can bend your knees a little more.

159
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
Okay.

160
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Yes.

161
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Are you okay?

162
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
No problem.

163
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
No problem.

164
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
Let me go.

165
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Okay.

166
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
You can wear some pants at home.

167
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Like this?

168
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Yes.

169
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I will be more comfortable.

170
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
More comfortable?

171
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
I am here.

172
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
We are here.

173
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Hey, Xiong, don't be so serious.

174
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,260
Look at you.

175
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,460
You're so serious.

176
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Isn't it a very serious matter?

177
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,060
It's been so many years.

178
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
If Nanxing and I are still as serious as you are,

179
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,660
they'll come to us again.

180
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Dad, Wan Xiaojun,

181
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,660
we're here to see you.

182
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,260
I brought you your favorite snacks.

183
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,060
Come on.

184
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,060
Dad.

185
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,860
Wan Xiaojun,

186
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,460
let me introduce you.

187
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,860
This is my boyfriend.

188
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,060
So you're the one who met your parents.

189
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Why did you say that in front of your mom?

190
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,860
Why else would I bring you here today?

191
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,060
Hi, Uncle.

192
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,660
Dad, Wan Xiaojun,

193
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,060
I have something to tell you.

194
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,660
I've written a novel

195
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,060
and it's part of our company's Star Project.

196
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,660
It's written by my boyfriend.

197
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,260
I'm awesome, right?

198
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
You're awesome.

199
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm so happy to tell you this.

200
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Xiaojun, you used to write and draw every day.

201
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
You didn't write any work.

202
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Nanxin is much better than you.

203
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
Auntie.

204
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
How is it? I told you.

205
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Someone has better taste than you.

206
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Someone has better taste than you.

207
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,260
I know you two have a problem.

208
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Tell me. I want to talk to you in person.

209
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,260
I heard you don't like oranges.

210
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
Orange.

211
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Make a friend.

212
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Let me do it, auntie.

213
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
It's okay.

214
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,260
Xiaoxiu, what are your plans in the future?

215
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
I haven't decided yet.

216
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
I haven't decided yet?

217
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
I haven't decided yet?

218
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Mom.

219
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Why did you go so long?

220
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
The toilet is a bit far.

221
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
Let's go.

222
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
The bowls are here, mom.

223
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
Put them there.

224
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
What's wrong with you?

225
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I'm fine.

226
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
What's wrong with you?

227
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
You and Xiao Xiong,

228
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
you two are open today.

229
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Xiao Xiong is a good person.

230
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
And smart.

231
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Most importantly, you are the one who wrote it.

232
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
This thing,

233
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,260
I should have been

234
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
happy about it.

235
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
You were not happy

236
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
now.

237
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
It's not that I'm not happy.

238
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
I asked him today.

239
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
I asked him today.

240
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
What are your plans for your future?

241
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,260
He said he didn't know.

242
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
He didn't think it through.

243
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,260
You really asked that?

244
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
What's wrong? I can't answer.

245
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
Don't ask him that question next time.

246
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Why can't I ask?

247
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,260
I want to ask you.

248
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
What are your plans

249
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
for your future?

250
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
There are some things

251
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
I can't tell you.

252
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Anyway,

253
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
no matter what happens to

254
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
me and him in the future,

255
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
I just hope that we can be together now.

256
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Do you have something

257
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
to hide from me?

258
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
What can't you tell me?

259
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Don't ask.

260
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
If I tell you,

261
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260
you won't believe me.

262
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
How do you know I don't believe you if you don't say it?

263
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Fine.

264
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,260
I won't say it.

265
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
I'm not your mother anyway.

266
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
What do you mean you're not my mother?

267
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,260
You are my mother.

268
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Then you won't tell me.

269
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
I'm worried about you.

270
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
It's our first time dating.

271
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
I asked Xiao Xiong today.

272
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
He said he didn't think it through.

273
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
He didn't tell me anything.

274
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
I just don't want you two to be together.

275
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Don't force yourself.

277
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Just forget it.

278
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,260
You don't have to be afraid.

279
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,260
Why are you using the bathroom?

280
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Why are you so serious?

281
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
You can have it by yourself.

282
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

283
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,260
I'll go.

284
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

285
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

286
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Don't worry.

287
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

288
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

289
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

290
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Don't worry.

291
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
I'm not a kid anymore.

292
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,860
Ma Xiaojun.

293
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,620
Why are you confusing me?

294
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,780
I'm not confusing you.

295
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,940
Let me copy your math homework.

296
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Do it yourself.

297
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,700
I can't write.

298
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,340
Look, I didn't write anything.

299
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,820
Why don't you teach me?

300
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,620
No, can't you think about it yourself?

301
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,660
I've thought about it.

302
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,620
I just can't.

303
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
Get out.

304
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,820
Take your math homework and think about it.

305
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,100
Think about it.

306
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,460
You must have made it.

307
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,580
You can do it before.

308
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,580
Jialuo.

309
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,660
How could I dream of Mao Xiaojun?

310
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,460
He likes Nanxing?

311
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,220
What does this dream mean?

312
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,100
Do you want me to tell Nanxing?

313
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
I'm not telling you.

314
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,060
I'm telling you.

315
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,820
Come on, let's go to theZA.

316
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,940
Let's go.

317
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,820
Let's go.

318
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:30,780
Xiaojun,

319
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:42,060
We still need to date

320
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,500
What's wrong with you?

321
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Well, I love her

322
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,300
I was wrong

323
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,380
It's ok

324
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,380
It's all right

325
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,060
We are no longer a couple

326
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,660
I know. Let's assume that you like Ye Qing.

327
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,460
You two are already together at this time.

328
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,380
Why are we together?

329
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,700
Is this important?

330
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,740
Of course. You said that we need logic.

331
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,020
You think about it first.

332
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,540
Okay.

333
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,020
You two are already together.

334
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,380
Wait.

335
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
What are you doing again?

336
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I'm not good at it.

337
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,540
You like Ye Qing.

338
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,740
You are already together at this time.

339
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,820
You suddenly found out that Ye Qing's crush was also having a crush on her.

340
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,180
Will you tell her?

341
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Of course.

342
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,780
If you tell her,

343
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,220
will you tell her that you will disappear from this world?

344
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,060
Yes.

345
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,380
Why?

346
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,540
Because if she finds out that we are telling her,

347
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,980
she will still disappear.

348
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,980
I knew that you can't help.

349
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,620
Wait.

350
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,820
Didn't you say that you wanted to discuss the plot with me?

351
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
What plot?

352
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,420
The secret is the murder world.

353
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,260
The murder weapon is a knife.

354
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,420
It must be a knife.

355
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
It must be a knife.

356
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,660
Then I don't know.

357
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,460
I've never used a knife.

358
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,860
I only know how to use poison.

359
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
I can't help you.

360
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
I'll think of a way.

361
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,260
Poison?

362
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,860
This is not bad.

363
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,260
Thank you.

364
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,980
Kiss.

365
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,580
Is this my mission?

366
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,060
Then I told Nan Xin that I will disappear again.

367
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,020
This is just a dream.

368
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
Don't think too much.

369
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,820
Nan Xin, are you done packing?

370
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,220
We're leaving.

371
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
I'm still changing.

372
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
Mom, you go first.

373
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,420
Okay.

374
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,020
I told you last night.

375
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,220
Think about it.

376
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,820
Okay.

377
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,820
Morning, Auntie.

378
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,620
Morning.

379
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,820
Did you forget to take the key?

380
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,220
Breakfast.

381
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,620
What are you going to do today?

382
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,620
I haven't finished it yet.

383
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,820
I haven't finished it yet.

384
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,220
Nan Xin.

385
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Yesterday, Auntie asked me at the cemetery.

386
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,020
She asked me what my future plans were for the two of us.

387
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
I didn't answer her.

388
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,820
I feel like she's a little disappointed in me.

389
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,220
I'm worried about you.

390
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,020
It's our first time dating.

391
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,420
I asked Xiao Xiong today and she said she didn't think about it.

392
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,220
I asked you and you didn't tell me anything.

393
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,820
I just don't want you two to be together so quickly.

394
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,420
What can I do then?

395
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,020
If she knows the truth, she will understand.

396
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,020
That's right.

397
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,220
If I was already in this world,

398
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
that would be great.

399
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,620
What if I was you?

400
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,220
Then I...

401
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,620
am your first love.

402
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,220
You're so childish.

403
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,820
What's wrong with being childish?

404
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,620
Although I'm not your first love,

405
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm still your first kiss.

406
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,020
What's first kiss?

407
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,620
I don't just want first kiss. I also want your first...

408
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,620
What first kiss? I'm warning you not to drive.

409
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,620
Is first love driving?

410
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,220
First love?

411
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,420
First time getting married.

412
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,820
You want to marry me?

413
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,820
I didn't get my first love.

414
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,820
It's my turn for the first time getting married.

415
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,420
Let's eat.

416
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,620
Let's eat.

417
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,620
Little Xing Xing.

418
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,420
Who's celebrating his birthday today?

419
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,820
I have something important to celebrate.

420
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,420
Isn't it the launch of the Star Project?

421
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,820
Not only that, your reading feedback is very good.

422
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,620
It's the most clicked video in the Star Project.

423
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,420
Really?

424
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,820
Teacher Nan, you're going to be famous.

425
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,220
Teacher Nan, why does it sound weird?

426
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,420
Sister Jiang, don't tease me.

427
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,620
Let's go. Let's cut the cake together.

428
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
Let's go.

429
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,820
Congratulations.

430
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Congratulations.

431
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,620
Congratulations.

432
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,820
Nan Xing, you're great.

433
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,020
Congratulations, Nan Xing.

434
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
Thank you, Sister Jiang.

435
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,820
I'll treat everyone to milk tea.

436
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,620
You guys drink. I'll treat you.

437
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,620
Congratulations.

438
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Open the champagne.

439
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,020
Open the champagne.

440
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Come on. Everyone, one piece.

441
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,020
I want one too.

442
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,620
I want to eat this gong dong dong.

443
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,020
I want to eat this gong dong dong.

444
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Come on.

445
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
Come on.

446
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,020
Let Lin Yin take a picture.

447
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,420
Come on.

448
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,020
Three, two, one.

449
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,620
Boss, boss.

450
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,020
Boss, come on.

451
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,420
Come on.

452
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,220
Again.

453
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,020
Three, two, one.

454
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,220
Scissors.

455
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
Take a picture.

456
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,020
President Ye, my novel is on the air.

457
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,620
It's a good thing.

458
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,220
Everyone is celebrating for me.

459
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,220
It would be great if you were here.

460
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,220
Even if you don't believe in yourself,

461
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,220
you should believe in why I chose you.

462
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,020
Thank you for telling me.

463
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,220
Even if I don't believe in myself,

464
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,220
I still have to believe in why you chose me.

465
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
I'm happy that you're still going forward

466
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,220
on the path you chose.

467
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
Hurry up.

468
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
You're the best when you show yourself.

469
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
You're the best when you show yourself.

470
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
You're the most talented when you show yourself.

471
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Lu Zi Chen is the most talented.

472
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Lu Zi Chen will definitely become the greatest writer.

473
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,220
I'm so happy.

474
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,020
You know what?

475
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,620
You're the gold medalist.

476
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,220
The people on the publishing house

477
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,620
always use your contract as a bait.

478
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,020
Now we have this.

479
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,220
I won't let them interfere with you anymore.

480
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
But they didn't sign you up.

481
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,420
It doesn't matter.

482
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,620
Although I like to think and write,

483
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,820
I feel happy when I write.

484
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,820
But I'm not as talented as you.

485
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,620
I don't have to be a writer.

486
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,020
I can find a job

487
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,620
to keep writing with you

488
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,220
and continue to be your first reader.

489
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,020
The most important thing is

490
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,820
that Lu Zi Chen's products

491
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,620
will be seen by the whole world.

492
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,820
You're so awesome.

493
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,620
I feel

494
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,820
so blessed.

495
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
I'm so excited.

496
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,220
I'm going to play.

497
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Look at this gold medal.

498
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,220
It's so cute.

499
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,620
It looks like you.

500
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,820
I like it.

501
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,420
Ye Qing.

502
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,620
If you have a job

503
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
that doesn't have much salary

504
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,220
but is very challenging,

505
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,820
would you like to do it?

506
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,220
What job is so unprofessional?

507
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,020
What job is so unprofessional?

508
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,020
Let's make a bet.

509
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,220
If I catch this doll

510
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,620
within three times,

511
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,620
you'll agree to this job.

512
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,820
This is so hard.

513
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,820
How is that possible?

514
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,420
So I said it's a bet.

515
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,420
I'll take it as a yes.

516
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,020
A little bit here.

517
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,420
A little bit to the right.

518
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,220
A little bit to the right.

519
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,020
Okay.

520
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
To the left.

521
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Okay.

522
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,820
Okay.

523
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,620
Stand up.

524
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,020
See?

525
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,820
I told you it's so hard.

526
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
You can do it yourself.

527
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,820
A little bit to the front.

528
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,820
Okay.

529
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,820
You have a chance.

530
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,820
I should have said four times.

531
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,820
Tell me what job it is.

532
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,220
Work with me.

533
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,620
I don't plan to go home.

534
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,820
I want to open my own company

535
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,020
and do publishing and literature.

536
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,220
I want to do my work well

537
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,420
and find more young authors like me.

538
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,620
But this job you mentioned

539
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
doesn't have much salary

540
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,420
but is very challenging.

541
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,420
It's really not good.

542
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,820
Let's go.

543
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,820
Continue.

544
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,020
Will it work?

545
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,220
We chose the wrong one.

546
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,420
I almost caught up with Lu Zichen's updates.

547
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Let's have dinner together tonight.

548
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,420
I'm going to bed.

549
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,420
Wow, the host is so good at it.

550
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
He said it so lovingly.

551
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,420
The host is so handsome.

552
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,420
And the heroine is so cute.

553
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
So loving.

554
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,420
The host is so handsome.

555
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Why did so many people say yes?

556
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
I think this plot is very creative.

557
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Did I miss the dance?

558
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
What do you mean by creative?

559
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
I think you are brainless.

560
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
Who is this?

561
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,420
I'm going to bed.

562
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
The dishes are ready.

563
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Thank you.

564
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
You're welcome.

565
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
I'm going to bed.

566
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Why is there still no signal?

567
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,420
The villain's boyfriend, Xiao Wu Di.

568
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,420
The novel sales are at the top.

569
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,420
I want to ask who the author is.

570
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
The situation is not even.

571
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Be careful.

572
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Be careful.

573
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
What's wrong with you?

574
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
What's wrong with you?

575
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
Be careful.

576
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
Stop.

577
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Stop.

578
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
What's wrong?

579
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,420
What did you say?

580
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
Sit down.

581
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
Sit down.

582
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
What are you doing?

583
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,420
You don't like it?

584
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
I...

585
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Don't do this again.

586
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
I'm just celebrating.

587
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,420
The novel has such a good click rate.

588
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
I'll change it next time.

589
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Let's eat. I'm starving.

590
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
Eat.

591
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,420
Have you ever seen the comments of the novel?

592
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,420
The male lead is so sweet.

593
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
So charming.

594
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,420
The fairy also added a same villain boyfriend to me.

595
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,420
Why are the comments of this netizen so talented?

596
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,420
So good-looking.

597
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,420
I think I'm better-looking.

598
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Eat more today.

599
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
This shrimp is good.

600
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Xiao Wu Di, thank you.

601
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,420
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have these stories.

602
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,420
I can't write this novel alone.

603
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
What are you doing?

604
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,420
Why are you so sentimental?

605
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,420
I really think I'm lucky.

606
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,420
I think I'm luckier.

607
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
I'm going to the bathroom.

608
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Okay.

609
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Enjoy.

610
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,420
Miss, are you okay?

611
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,420
Xiao Wu Di.

612
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
What's wrong?

613
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Are you okay?

614
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
Are you feeling better?

615
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm sorry.

616
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,420
I thought of you again.

617
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
Are you stupid?

618
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Is this the time to apologize?

619
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
I didn't say anything.

620
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,420
I just wanted to apologize.

621
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,420
It wasn't that serious before.

622
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Why are you suddenly like this today?

623
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,420
The doctor said that my illness

624
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,420
might get worse.

625
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,420
But I'm usually fine.

626
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,420
Don't worry about me.

627
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
I'm fine.

628
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Did you think

629
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
that I wanted to leave

630
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,420
so you...

631
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,420
No.

632
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Don't think about that.

633
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,420
I left the company because of Mr. Ye.

634
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,420
He put a lot of work on me.

635
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
How can I handle it alone?

636
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
Plus, my mom likes to nag at me.

637
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,420
I feel so embarrassed.

638
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,420
Your mom nagged at you?

639
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,420
What did she nag at you about?

640
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,420
She asked me

641
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,420
what our plans were for the future.

642
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,420
I can't explain your identity to her.

643
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,420
I just can't answer her.

644
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,420
She thought that something happened between us.

645
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
Don't worry.

646
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Aunt An loves you so much.

647
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,420
It's normal for her to care about our future.

648
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,420
I'll find a suitable time

649
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,420
to explain everything to her.

650
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
It's okay.

651
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
Don't think too much.

652
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,420
I know.

653
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,420
Nan Xing, don't worry.

654
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
I'll find a way

655
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,420
to cure your illness.
