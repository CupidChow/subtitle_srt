[Episode 12]

4
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,820
Mr. Cheng,

5
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,740
they might procrastinate.

6
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,650
We should

7
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,900
find a solution.

8
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,660
I

9
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,780
checked the contract.

10
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,340
They omitted some details.

11
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,500
Yes.

12
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,660
Okay.

13
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,820
I sense that there are problems.

14
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,180
We'll confirm

15
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,020
at the meeting

16
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,620
this afternoon.

17
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,380
No problem.

18
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,140
Hello.

19
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,380
Hello, Mr. Li.

20
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,539
Yes.

21
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,690
I know why you

22
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,620
call

23
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,810
but we cannot hire

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,220
the actor

25
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,860
because of our company's

26
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,170
future development direction.

27
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,620
I hope you understand.

28
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,780
Okay.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,020
Please consider

30
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,850
our suggestion.

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,220
No problem. Bye.

32
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,730
The contract says

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,100
that we may take part.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,420
If they

35
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,500
want web traffic,

36
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,770
we can sue them.

37
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,090
We might win.

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,010
A lawsuit

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,620
will take at least two years.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,020
If we stop

41
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,380
our project for two years,

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,940
we'll miss

43
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,329
the golden development period.

44
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,610
Don't worry.

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,460
I won't hire the actor.

46
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,220
I know

47
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,579
what this role is.

48
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,890
I will

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,220
find a solution soon.

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,890
Have you

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,329
been working non-stop?

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,010
I rest every weekend.

53
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,620
What did you do last weekend?

54
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,530
I played golf with a business partner.

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,770
The week before last?

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,820
I visited an event venue.

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,540
You did not rest.

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,220
You need an actual rest.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,580
How could I?

60
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,580
If I rest,

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,260
the whole company has to rest.

62
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,530
You skipped

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,010
extreme sports for a long time.

64
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,620
I was busy.

65
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,970
I forgot when

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,380
was the last time I did it.

67
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,540
I've lost

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,660
my former self.

69
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,860
What?

70
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,260
What are you doing?

71
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,020
Help you solve your problem.

72
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,850
I am busy.

73
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,820
Just go.

74
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,450
I haven't changed my shoes.
Where are we going?

75
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,900
Okay.

76
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,820
Let's meet up later.

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,940
During our university years,

78
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,329
we came here to have fun.

79
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,020
I have

80
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,140
an afternoon meeting

81
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,490
and

82
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,730
must make an appointment

83
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,010
with the lawyer
about the film investors' lawsuit

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,450
and...

85
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,180
I own the original script of the movie.

86
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,500
If you don't obey me today, I'll give

87
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,490
the project

88
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,500
to someone.

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,089
Your job today

90
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,130
is to take a good rest.

91
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:38,380
I want you

92
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,820
to get away from your work

93
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,660
and like you said,

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,740
find your old self.

95
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,820
Hello!

96
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,540
Hello!

97
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,540
I've warmed up.

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,450
We can start.

99
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,409
Long time no see, Xiaogao.

100
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,490
Hello, long time no see.

101
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,530
You haven't changed.

102
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,130
Join us?

103
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,340
He is afraid of water.

104
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,050
Right.

105
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,290
Just like back then.

106
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,659
Come, let's adjust the board.

107
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,260
Okay.

108
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,740
I'm surprised

109
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,690
that you still ski.

110
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,820
I always like this

111
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,810
but was busy with work

112
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,410
and couldn't come.

113
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,020
You were the water skiing goddess

114
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,340
for many coaches here.

115
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,810
Right?

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,700
Yes.

117
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,100
I haven't skied for years.

118
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,410
I don't know

119
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,660
if I'll feel the same.

120
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,530
You can. No problem.

121
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,100
Let's do it.

122
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,090
Not coming?

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,580
I'll go first.

124
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,530
Come!

125
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,060
You can do it.

126
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,980
Let's go!

127
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,370
Let's go.

128
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,410
Let's go.

129
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,220
You got this!

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,010
You got this, Ye Qing.

131
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,100
You got this.

132
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,060
You got this, Ye Qing.

133
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,540
You can do it!

134
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,659
I haven't had this much fun

135
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,260
in a long time!

136
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,380
Thank you, Zichen.

137
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,180
What for?

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,620
For dragging me here.

139
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,659
Don't mention it.

140
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,210
You looked

141
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,140
excited.

142
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,860
Did you de-stress?

143
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,010
Let me tell you.

144
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,700
Just now,

145
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,860
when I fell,

146
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,220
my mind became clear.

147
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,900
It's just a lawsuit.

148
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,780
If it takes two or five years,

149
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,420
we'll sue

150
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,780
until the copyright expires.

151
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,140
I'm not scared.

152
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,660
Ye Qing,

153
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,940
I booked the bungee jump.

154
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,820
Okay.

155
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,890
Let's go.

156
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,610
There is a good bungee jump site

157
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,500
nearby.

158
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,690
I'll jump first

159
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,860
before we go back.

160
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,700
Let's go.

161
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,050
I'll go too.

162
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,610
Isn't it boring just watching?

163
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,850
I'm not watching.

164
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,620
I...

165
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,970
I'll jump too.

166
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,650
Don't you have acrophobia?

167
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,780
No.

168
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,280
Let's go.

169
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,300
You can do it.

170
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,580
Come.

171
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,900
It's so high.

172
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:53,900
Are you okay?

173
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,340
Really?

174
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,700
Are you first?

175
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,130
I'll go first.

176
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,300
I can do it.

177
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,380
Here.

178
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,620
Here. Ready. Walk forward.

179
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:20,100
[Warning! These stunts are dangerous.
Do not attempt any of the stunts.]

180
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,780

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,860
but how do you repay me?

358
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,570
Fine.

359
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,620
I'll also write an article about you

360
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,740
to remind you

361
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,420
about the truth.

362
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,060
Where should I start?

363
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,930
Xiao Wudi, Young Master Hehuan,

364
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
is

365
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,020
a great hero respected by everyone.

366
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,860
One day,

367
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,540
he was suddenly summoned

368
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,180
to this real world, where danger
lurks on every side.

369
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,090
Is

370
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,140
this handsome guy

371
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,050
sent by heaven?

372
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,250
Why is he still asleep?

373
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,570
Maybe

374
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,330
I'll wake you up with a kiss.

375
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,220
He looks dignified

376
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,500
and suave.

377
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,620
How dare you

378
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,050
take advantage of me

379
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,250
and make sexual advances?

380
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,130
I was

381
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,370
attracted to you.

382
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,220
Please forgive me.

383
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,740
Young Master, please have breakfast.

384
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,090
Is it unappetizing?

385
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,820
I just woke up and have no appetite.

386
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,020
Didn't you say earlier

387
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,940
that anything less than ten courses

388
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,820
isn't fit for humans?

389
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,010
Young Master,

390
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,860
please eat some.

391
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,730
A woman should keep her distance.

392
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,500
You are flirty.

393
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,330
No one will marry you.

394
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,690
My life was ruined the moment I saw you.

395
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,420
I have

396
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,570
seen your real face.

397
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,620
I will only marry you and no one else.

398
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,730
Ridiculous.

399
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,890
A marriage is not child's play.

400
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,900
I won't marry you.

401
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,140
Young Master,

402
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,890
if you can't marry me,

403
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,900
let me stay,

404
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,780
even as a maid to wash your feet.

405
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,060
Absolutely not.

406
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,900
I'll do anything!

407
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,620
No.

408
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,970
Don't leave me!

409
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,450
Let me stay

410
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
and you can have my car, house,

411
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,260
and household registration book.

412
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,650
If I leave,

413
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,100
will you kill yourself?

414
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,740
Yes.

415
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,930
If you dare to leave me,

416
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,370
I'll kill myself.

417
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,460
Fine.

418
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,820
I pity you.

419
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,620
You may stay.

420
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,580
Thank you, Young Master.

421
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,060
[Nan Xiaoxing stopped crying immediately.]

422
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,780
[A bright smile appeared on her face.]

423
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,810
[It's as if her lifelong wish]

424
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,380
[has been fulfilled.)

425
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,850
What's this?

426
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,420
My Hero Master.

427
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,700
Did you

428
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,180
call me home to read this?

429
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,100
The story I wrote

430
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,090
is more suitable

431
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
for our real-life relationship

432
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,410
and fits your real-life

433
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,820
fangirl character.

434
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,820
I'm not a fangirl anymore.

435
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,140
It's...

436
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,100
You

437
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,860
can't see yourself.

438
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,780
How do you know you're not?

439
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,250
Wudi Bear,

440
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,700
do you think

441
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
he is narcissistic?

442
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,690
I am just

443
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,060
giving you a reference.

444
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,580
I'm here to remind you

445
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,860
that when you write,

446
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,020
do not

447
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,020
deviate from the basic reality.

448
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,020
Hasn't he deviated

449
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,740
from the basic reality?

450
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,530
I clearly remember

451
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,740
what was in my mind.

452
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,450
I was scared of him

453
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,820
and wanted to avoid him.

454
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,900
Why would I

455
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,180
kneel and beg him to marry me?

456
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,410
Why are you afraid of me?

457
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,980
You are scary.

458
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,930
You threatened me in my dream,

459
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,210
followed me home,

460
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,620
and slept next to me.

461
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,740
Then you kidnapped Aunt An

462
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,100
to force me to cooperate.

463
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,650
You...

464
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,540
Any normal person will be scared.

465
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,610
Wrong.

466
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,180
Please explain

467
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,100
why is it that

468
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,500
when you first saw me,

469
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,660
you said dirty words to me when I was

470
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,740
unconscious?

471
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,940
A handsome guy in ancient costumes.

472
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,650
The heroine comes to his rescue.

473
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,500
It is love at first sight for him.

474
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,380
Finally, he promises to marry her.

475
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,170
What was that?

476
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,290
Casual remarks?

477
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,130
Yes.

478
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,180
He wants to hit me.

479
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,020
Fine.

480
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,970
Since we two disagree

481
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,650
about the direction,

482
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,260
we can stop writing this novel!

483
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,100
This was originally

484
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,140
written by me.

485
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,700
Why are you intervening?

486
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,820
Am I?

487
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,220
Don't forget

488
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,300
that I asked you

489
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,090
to write this novel.

490
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,410
I am the main character in this novel.

491
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,940
I said every word he said,

492
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,980
and did everything

493
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,540
he did.

494
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,220
I own half of it.

495
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,090
What

496
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,500
do you want to do?

497
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,580
What do I want to do?

498
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,900
Listen.

499
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,810
This story

500
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,940
belongs to

501
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,930
both of us.

502
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,980
Before it is published,

503
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,460
both of us

504
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,940
should reach an agreement.

505
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,130
You're overthinking this.

506
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,860
It's far from ready for publication.

507
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,730
I have to warn you first.

508
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,330
Did you

509
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,580
write

510
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,460
something not presentable?

511
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
[He mustn't know]

512
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,730
[about My Demonic Neighbour.]

513
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,780
Let me read.

514
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,420
No.

515
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,220
I haven't written anything.

516
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,570
I've been busy lately.

517
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,220
Busy doing what?

518
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,860
I'll go back and write.

519
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,660
Bye-bye.

520
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,850
It's pretty good.

521
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,100
If he sees this,

522
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,620
I'm dead.

523
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,100
I describe

524
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,890
the male lead as the boss.

525
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,010
I can't submit this.

526
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,900
Am I so scary?

527
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,420
Does she have a bad impression of me?

528
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,810
[Because you are scary.]

529
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,740
You threatened me in my dream,

530
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,060
followed me home,

531
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,410
and slept next to me.

532
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,660
Then you kidnapped Aunt An

533
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,010
to force me to cooperate.

534
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:04,540
You...

535
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,420
Any normal person will be scared.

536
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,650
That's why she misunderstood.

537
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,220
Indeed, I said

538
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,700
I wanted to kidnap Aunt An.

539
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,660
Any normal person would be afraid,

540
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,180
but I didn't mean it.

541
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,860
I didn't do it.

542
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,340
What else can I write?

543
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,620
I am right about

544
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,690
she being a fangirl.

545
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,250
I heard it.

546
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,530
I am handsome.

547
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,500
That should counterbalance

548
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,980
her impression of me.

549
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,290
I'll find out tomorrow.

550
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,980
Senior, please slow down.

551
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,980
It's pouring.

552
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,300
Find a shelter or you'll

553
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,100
get a cold.

554
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,890
Never mind.

555
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,020
It's urgent.

556
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,940
Even so,

557
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,410
you shouldn't catch a cold.

558
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,300
Slow down!

559
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:10,940
Hello, hello!

560
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,700
Are you okay?

561
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,420
Coming.

562
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,130
Slow down.

563
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:13,930
Don't rush.

564
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,620
No problem.

565
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,300
Hello.

566
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,180
Sorry for being late.

567
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:21,930
It's okay.

568
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,420
Okay.

569
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,020
Leave us.

570
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,570
Go.

571
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,580
Order food.

572
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,050
May I take your order?

573
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,580
Here.

574
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,460
Thank you.

575
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,610
Two glasses of homemade carbonated water.

576
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,210
Thank you.

577
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,690
Tell me something.

578
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,450
If your senior, Nan Xing,

579
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,690
meets someone

580
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,220
who

581
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,100
might have

582
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,620
offended her

583
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,100
but he is

584
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,460
good looking,

585
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,050
will she feel

586
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,020
slightly

587
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,570
neutral to him?

588
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,690
Definitely not.

589
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,220
What are you thinking?

590
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,570
She doesn't

591
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,090
judge people by their faces.

592
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,610
Is that true?

593
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,500
Yes.

594
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,690
Examples are

595
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,700
the senior she met while jogging,

596
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,810
a Lu Zichen fan

597
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,260
she met on the road,

598
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,340
and a nice guy

599
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,980
who picked up her tissue.

600
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,530
she was obsessed with them.

601
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,370
Then what?

602
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:21,940
Then what?

603
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,170
That's all.

604
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,260
Nothing else.

605
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,690
She is

606
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,690
very principled.

607
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,370
It's true.

608
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,940
She likes men

609
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,020
not because she is

610
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,060
a fangirl.

611
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,370
These are different things.

612
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:35,930
Have a drink.

613
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,770
No, thank you.

614
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,090
I like milk tea.

615
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,500
Order one milk tea.

616
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,700
Well,

617
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,330
I'll make another analogy.

618
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,580
Let's say there is a man

619
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,610
who is a bit cunning

620
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,980
and perhaps

621
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,170
likes to fool people.

622
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,850
Do you think this guy

623
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,220
stand a chance?

624
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,980
Most likely he'll be eliminated.

625
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,500
Listen.

626
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,300
This guy

627
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
would not get her.

628
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,730
When she has a bad

629
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,570
first impression,

630
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,940
her mind will be set.

631
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,490
Let me tell you.

632
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,980
I feel that her ideal type

633
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,140
is always the same.

634
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,460
It has never changed.

635
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,050
She only likes

636
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,060
one type.

637
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,940
What type?

638
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,570
Suave, courteous,

639
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,980
and righteous warm guy,

640
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,380
like her novels'

641
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,620
main characters.

642
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,770
That's it.

643
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,020
I know righteousness.

644
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,650
What is a warm guy?

645
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,100
He is...

646
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,420
Look.

647
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,810
Like him.

648
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,580
He holds the umbrella,

649
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,370
protects her under it,

650
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,140
and holds her.

651
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,380
That's a warm guy.

652
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,340
In this restaurant,

653
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,460
he pulls her chair out for her,

654
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,780
places the cutlery for her,

655
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,540
hangs up her clothes,

656
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
and then puts those sandwiches

657
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,860
on the table.

658
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,380
Wait.

659
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,900
Then...

660
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,820
Is she

661
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,060
physically challenged?

662
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,330
That's like

663
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,410
having a nurse.

664
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,300
She likes it anyway.

665
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,380
Do you like it?

666
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,820
Of course.

667
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,210
Who doesn't like that?

668
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,380
Of course.

669
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,820
Isn't that just acting?

670
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,020
Okay.

671
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,650
Thank you.

672
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm leaving.

673
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,300
Leaving?

674
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,020
Bye bye.

675
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,500
Thanks for the fried chicken.

676
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,100
It is so fragrant.

677
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,540
Senior,

678
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,450
the coach said...

679
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,220
Hey,

680
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,860
I haven't eaten for two weeks.

681
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:56,980
Let go.

682
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:32,300
[Xiao Wudi]

683
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,580
[Miss Nan,]

684
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,700
[I cordially invite you]

685
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,460
[to my house tonight]

686
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,780
[to discuss
the plot of the novel.]

687
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,540
[Your warm friend, Xiao Wudi.]

688
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,300
What's wrong with him?

689
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,180
Such a weird tone.

690
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,020
[I'm meeting my colleague.]

691
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,260
[I might be home late.]

692
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,850
[Nan Xing]

693
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:54,010
[Xiao Wudi]

694
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,900
[It doesn't matter.]

695
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,650
[I can wait.]

696
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,780
[I won't]

697

[get mad over a no-show too.]

698
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,860
Weird.

699
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,140
Boss,

700
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,940
why are you here?

701
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,420
Aren't you on leave?

702
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,500
I am fine.

703
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,980
At first, I wanted

704
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,340
to take it easy today

705
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,220
and leave early.

706
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,010
Why don't you rest some more?

707
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:18,820
Mr. Lu,

708
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,020
how are you feeling?

709
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,260
Much better.

710
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,610
You are...

711
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,290
Miss Ye left her keys

712
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:28,970
in the ward.

713
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,570
It's my rest day.

714
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,540
So, I dropped by.

715
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,690
It was my fault.

716
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,490
I was perturbed

717
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
and forgot about them.

718
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,410
Afterwards,

719
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,450
we'll go rock climbing.

720
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,330
Come along.

721
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,690
No. Continue your chat.

722
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,580
Okay.

723
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,180
What's up?

724
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,660
Can I help you?

725
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,970
It's okay.

726
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,210
Sure?

727
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,340
The day after tomorrow,

728
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,620
are you on a business trip?

729
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,500
Yes.

730
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,450
Business meeting.

731
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,740
I'll meet some partners.

732
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,260
What is it?

733
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,740
You should go back early
in the next two days

734
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,660
and rest.

735
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,530
Okay.

736
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,500
I added you to the extreme sports group.

737
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,570
It held activities

738
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,780
but you never responded.

739
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,930
I saw those messages

740
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,860
but when I got

741
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,540
work-related information,

742
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,780
I lost my mood

743
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,970
and worked instead.

744
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,220
I was busy.

745
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,180
I would love to go.

746
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,770
Isn't it a coincidence

747
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,700
that I return the keys?

748
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,580
I can ask you to go rock climbing.

749
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,460
Thank you so much.

750
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,260
Can you climb?

751
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,540
I won awards before.

752
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,580
Awesome.

753
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,250
We shall see.

754
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,610
Boss,

755
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,060
are you looking for me?

756
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,660
No.

757
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,739
You can do it!

758
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,020
You can do it!

759
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,010
Thanks.

760
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:58,940
For many years,

761
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,980
no girl had defeated me.

762
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,620
For many years,

763
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,100
no one called me a girl.

764
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,820
Is Mr. Lu interested in you?

765
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,179
Zichen?

766
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,780
Do you believe in online gossip?

767
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,860
I don't read that.

768
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,210
A few days ago,

769
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,100
he bungee jumped

770
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,490
although he feared heights

771
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,740
and was bad at it.

772
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,980
He did it bravely.

773
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,940
Isn't he interested in you?

774
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,370
Impossible.

775
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,340
Why?

776
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,340
Do you know

777
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,100
that we

778
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,460
did a lot of things together

779
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,020
but every time, it became

780
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,260
work-related.

781
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,810
Do you know

782
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,730
that he took me to the cinema

783
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,610
to watch a New Year's Eve love movie?

784
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,060
Wasn't

785
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,340
that very romantic?

786
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,260
Guess what?

787
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,450
His next series was

788
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,500
a New Year's Eve
cinema dismemberment case.

789
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,210
Awesome.

790
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,420
People change.

791
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,810
After knowing each other for years,

792
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,730
it's normal to fall in love.

793
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,650
Zichen

794
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
doesn't

795
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,340
change easily.

796
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,940
For many years,

797
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,380
he

798
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,900
wrote with a pen.

799
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,940
Others think

800
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,450
he is sick

801
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,220
but that's what he is.

802
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,700
After he said

803
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,380
he doesn't like me,

804
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,860
he won't like me.

805
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,090
Did he tell you directly?

806
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,540
He

807
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,740
has another quality.

808
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,500
He is very direct.

809
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,330
Sometimes, men

810
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
lie.

811
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,410
Think about

812
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,580
what he said.

813
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,380
My arm is sore.

814
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,020
I should go home and massage.

815
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,170
Take a good rest.

816
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,180
I need

817
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,100
a hot compress too.

818
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,490
If not, tomorrow...

819
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,620
My friend is here.

820
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,730
Okay.

821
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,570
Hello.

822
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,300
Hello.

823
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,780
Let's meet again.

824
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,370
Okay.

825
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,610
I'll go first.

826
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,580
Bye-bye

827
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,290
Bye-bye.

828
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,980
Are you ready?

829
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,410
Mum.

830
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,420
I'll go across to visit Xiong.

831
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,650
I just created a new dish.

832
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,020
Bring some for him to try.

833
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,100
Okay.

834
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,410
Xiao Wudi, my mother asked me...

835
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,130
Why is the light off?

836
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,220
Is it broken?

837
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,700
Don't move.
