1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
P TRANSFORMATION

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Guess who I am?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Write down the most touching story

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's the time I met you

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Before the promise is made

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I throw away the pen

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And call out my name

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the distant space

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I hear you in my heart

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You are destined to be with me

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Come to me

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Stay with me

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You are the past and the past

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The life that never changes

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Come for me

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Stay by me

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Your look fills my heart

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll be with me

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The E pegs Me

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Youle Beauty is in your hands in the autumn

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Warm hands and warm hearts

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Youle Beauty invites you to enjoyed moments

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll watch a movie for you

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What good can I get

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You definitely don't like watching those kind of movies

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How can you know if you haven't tried

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then let's watch it together

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
cheat

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Maybe they will keep delaying

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I think

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Think of a solution

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I looked at all the contract details

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
I think there are some mistakes

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,880
Yes

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,920
Ok

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,960
But I think there is something wrong

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,400
Well

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
We can make sure it in the afternoon

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,560
Ok, no problem

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Hello, Mr. Li

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,680
I know why you called me

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
But we can't use this actor

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,760
Because it relates to

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,320
the future development of our company

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,720
I hope you can understand

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,040
Ok

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,000
Please consider our suggestion

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,080
Ok, no problem

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,560
Bye

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
The contract stipulates

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,320
that we have the right to participate

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
If they insist on using Liu Liang

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
we will file a lawsuit with them

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,440
Anyway, it's not impossible

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
But if we file a lawsuit

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
it will take at least two years

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
If our project

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
stops for two years

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,640
we will miss the golden development period

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,040
Don't worry

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,880
I won't use this actor

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,880
I know what this character

64
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,840
should look like

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
I will think of a solution as soon as possible

66
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,640
Okay

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,080
It's been a long time

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
to see you

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
I need to rest every weekend

70
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,280
How have you been on weekends?

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,160
I had contact with timbara

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,520
How about weekends?

73
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,400
I have...

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,560
toises

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,280
Itbook is different fromday

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,880
It's the real rest

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
How can we have rest?

78
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,520
We should have rest

79
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,800
at my company

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,400
You haven't done the extreme sports for a long time, right?

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
I don't have that time.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't remember when it was last time.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
I can't find myself as I used to be.

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
What?

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you doing?

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm taking you to solve the problem.

87
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I have one more thing to do.

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Go and talk to me.

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
I haven't even changed my shoes. Where are you going?

90
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay, let's do this first. We'll talk later.

91
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,600
When I was in college, I liked to come to Zhao Yun.

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
But I have a project to do.

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,600
And I need to talk to the lawyer about the film investment.

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm the original creator of the film.

95
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
If you don't listen to me today, I'll leave this project to others.

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Your task today is to rest well.

97
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,800
I just want to take you away from work.

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Just like what you said, find yourself as you used to be.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Hello.

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Hello.

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm done warming up. I can start now.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Long time no see, Xiao Gao.

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Hello, long time no see.

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Why haven't you changed? Are you still playing?

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,400
He's a little afraid of water.

106
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Oh, right. He didn't play much back then.

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Come on, let's pick the bottom board.

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
I never thought you would still play after so many years.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Since I was born, I've always wanted to play.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,400
I want to play when I grow up.

112
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I want to play when I grow up.

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
You're still playing?

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,400
I've always wanted to play, but I'm busy with work. I can't come.

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,200
You were the goddess of water for all the coaches.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,000
Right?

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes.

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
But I haven't played for many years.

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
I don't know if I can get this feeling back today.

120
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
You can. No problem. Come on.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
You're really not playing?

122
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Then I'll go first.

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Come on.

124
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Come on.

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Let's go.

126
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Come on.

128
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Come on, Ye Qing.

129
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Come on, Ye Qing.

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Come on, Ye Qing.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
You can do it.

132
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
That was so satisfying.

133
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
I haven't felt this satisfied in a long time.

134
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
I haven't felt this satisfied in a long time.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you, Zichen.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Why are you thanking me?

137
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Thank you for bringing me out.

138
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
You're welcome. You seemed very excited just now.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Are you feeling emotional?

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Let me tell you.

141
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,400
I just thought of a lot of things when I was hanging out with the kids.

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,600
It's just a lawsuit.

143
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
It doesn't matter if he plays for two years or five years.

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
It's good if he plays until he's out of power.

145
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Who's afraid of who?

146
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,800
Ye Qing, the bungee jump team has made an appointment for you.

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay.

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Let's go.

149
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
They said there's a place nearby that's fun to jump.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
Let's go there and jump first.

151
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Then we'll go back to the city, okay?

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll go with you.

153
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,200
It's boring to watch it from below.

154
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
Who said I can watch it from below?

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
I...

156
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll play with you.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Didn't you jump high?

158
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Who jumped high?

159
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Let's go.

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
Let's go.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
Jiayou.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,940
not at all

163
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,420
Wow, this is very high

164
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,540
Are you ok?

165
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
Is it real?

166
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,360
How about you go first

167
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,380
So I go first

168
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,180
I can

169
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,140
Come

170
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,180
Come, ready, go forward

171
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,380
Come, turn around

172
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,820
Hey, can you remember

173
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,460
Come, I'll count later

174
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,820
When you count to one

175
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,980
Both hands must move at the same time

176
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,740
Come, ready

177
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,660
Three

178
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,580
Two

179
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,860
One, hands off

180
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,940
Come

181
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,780
Zichen

182
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Are you okay

183
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,580
Lu Zichen

184
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,740
Lu Zichen

185
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,180
It seems to be dizzy

186
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,940
Come

187
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,220
Zichen

188
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,100
Hey, Zichen

189
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,900
Lu Zichen, wake up

190
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,340
Are you alive

191
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,460
Lu Zichen

192
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,340
Wake up

193
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,940
I used to be a member of that factory

194
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,860
The coach there is very nice

195
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,780
The coach is my senior

196
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,860
Now you are the first in the class

197
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,060
Really?

198
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,060
I heard that you were not interested in it recently

199
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,380
I have been very busy

200
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,260
And I don't have any friends around me

201
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,380
Can you go climbing with me

202
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,900
But I think today

203
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,180
I can put these hobbies

204
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,300
Feel it all back

205
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,340
Ok

206
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,780
Let's go together next time

207
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Good idea

208
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,780
The director built a WeChat group

209
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,740
I'll give it to you later

210
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,580
I'll go with you

211
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,140
Okay

212
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,020
WeChat group

213
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,860
I'll give it to you later

214
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,580
No problem

215
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,100
You can add WeChat

216
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,660
Okay

217
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,100
You are awake

218
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,540
Let me check you

219
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,020
Slow down

220
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,300
Slow down

221
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,700
Check your heartbeat

222
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,220
Your heart beats a little fast

223
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,980
Are you still feeling unwell?

224
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,500
All the indicators are normal

225
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,540
Just a little too much of a shock

226
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,540
You can leave the hospital

227
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,660
After you have a heart attack

228
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,580
You can leave the hospital

229
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,020
Okay, thank you, doctor

230
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,620
It's okay

231
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,500
We will contact you later

232
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,260
No problem

233
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,780
I'm leaving

234
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,300
Ok

235
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Bye

236
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,460
How do you feel now?

237
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,380
Your next series

238
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,860
Is it going to be about extreme sports?

239
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,660
No

240
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,900
I know

241
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,700
You are going to write about jumping

242
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,820
No

243
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,660
I'm fine

244
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,420
That's good

245
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,660
When you fainted just now

246
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,300
The company called me several times

247
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,620
I have to go back and handle it

248
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,860
I'll pick you up later

249
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm really fine

250
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,260
I can do it myself

251
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Then I'll ask Nanxing to pick you up

252
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,260
I'll work overtime

253
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,780
Then you can send me a message

254
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,020
Are things between you and I

255
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,140
Worthy of being between us?

256
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,780
I and Xiao W plug

257
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,180
How am I supposed to start?

258
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,700
you're home

259
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,540
Are you back, mom

260
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,660
You are here

261
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,980
Such style

262
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,700
Jeans

263
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,700
This is too strange. Why is the store always on pause?

264
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,300
Did the master say what reason?

265
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,700
No, I don't know either.

266
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,100
You're writing something?

267
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Go on.

268
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Go on. I won't bother you.

269
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,500
How do I write this?

270
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
How did you write it?

271
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,700
How did he know I was really writing this?

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
I'm about to write it.

274
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Do you need me to provide the material?

275
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,100
Not now.

276
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,100
I've decided to support your writing career.

277
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I'll be there at your call.

278
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,900
He's quite heart-wrenching.

279
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,900
No rush. There's always a time when you can't write a love story.

280
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,900
When that time comes, you can still come to me and beg for help.

281
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,900
How do I write it?

282
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,300
When that time comes, you can still come to me and beg for help.

283
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
You have to ask me out.

284
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,500
You have to hold hands and try.

285
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
You have to hug me.

286
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,100
Even...

287
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,300
I'm so embarrassed.

288
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,300
How will he write it?

289
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,900
How about I ask him?

290
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
No.

291
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,500
He's so carefree.

292
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I can't ask him for help.

293
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,500
I can't ask him to know I'm concerned about this.

294
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm sorry.

295
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,900
Mom, hurry up. The delivery man will be here soon.

296
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Hurry up.

297
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Let's go.

298
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,500
I said I wouldn't ask.

299
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
But I didn't say I couldn't peek.

300
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
He really wrote it?

301
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,100
Young Master, this is the breakfast I prepared for you.

302
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,900
Ten dishes less than breakfast.

303
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,100
Is that still a normal life?

304
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,500
I've already paid all my money to order food for you. I don't have any money left.

305
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,700
It's okay if you don't have money.

306
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
That Lu Zichen...

307
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,100
Why is there still Lu Zichen in here?

308
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,700
Nan Xiaoxin thought she escaped from the heaven,

309
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,300
but she never thought that she can't get rid of Xiao Wu Di's demon claws.

310
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,500
Xiao Wu Di, the demon!

311
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,100
That's not right. What did she write?

312
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,700
My evil neighbor.

313
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,500
So in her heart,

314
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm just an evil neighbor.

315
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,300
Here.

316
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,300
God bless you!

317
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,100
I'm sincere and sincere to you

318
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,300
but you just hit me like that?

319
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Okay. I'll write a letter to you.

320
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I'll remind you what is true love.

321
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Where should I start writing?

322
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
He Huang, Xiao Wu Di,

323
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
was a great hero.

324
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
But one day,

325
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
he was summoned to this dangerous reality.

326
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Is this the beautiful man

327
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
God gave me?

328
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Why haven't you woken up?

329
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Or I'll wake you up.

330
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm wrong.

331
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:42,620
I was thinking about the

332
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
This noise is cold

333
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,500
How can I enter?

334
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,780
Please forgive me.

335
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,260
Sir, have breakfast.

336
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,540
Is it because the food is not to your taste?

337
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,380
I have no taste when I get up in the morning.

338
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,620
But you said before

339
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,540
that if breakfast is less than ten dishes,

340
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,340
it's not a normal day.

341
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,300
Sir, please have a few bites.

342
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,300
Men and women are different.

343
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,060
You are so frugal.

344
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,900
How can you get married?

345
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,180
A young man is always right.

346
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,180
I have seen your true face.

347
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,140
I will marry you.

348
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,460
Nonsense.

349
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,420
Marriage is not a joke.

350
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,460
I won't marry you.

351
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,700
Sir.

352
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,460
If you can't take the room,

353
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,500
let me stay by your side

354
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,140
and be your foot bath.

355
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,620
No way.

356
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,580
You can be a cow or a horse.

357
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,100
No way.

358
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,540
Sir, don't leave me.

359
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,940
As long as you don't leave me,

360
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,780
I will give you my car, house and household register.

361
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,220
But if I leave,

362
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,740
will you seek death and live in peace?

363
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,380
Yes.

364
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,580
If you dare to leave me,

365
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,020
I will kill you.

366
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,300
Okay.

367
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,380
For the sake of your pity,

368
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,140
I won't drive you away.

369
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,940
Thank you, sir.

370
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
Kiss.

371
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,420
Nan Xiaoxin's crying stopped suddenly.

372
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,180
She showed a clear smile on her face.

373
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,740
It seems that her wish to live is finally fulfilled.

374
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,260
What are you writing?

375
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,700
My hero master.

376
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,500
You asked me to come back to see this.

377
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,420
The story I wrote

378
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,620
is more suitable for our real life relationship.

379
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,660
It also fits the person

380
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,180
who is a flower in your real life.

381
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,020
This is not a flower, okay?

382
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,340
You can...

383
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,220
You can't see yourself.

384
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,140
How do you know you don't have it?

385
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Xiaoxiong.

386
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,340
Some people are a little too narcissistic, aren't they?

387
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,500
I just gave you a reference.

388
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,060
I'm just reminding you

389
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,380
not to leave the basis of reality

390
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,380
when you write.

391
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,180
He's already out of the basis of reality, okay?

392
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,060
I remember clearly

393
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,260
what I was thinking at that time.

394
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,980
I was so scared when I saw him.

395
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,340
I couldn't even avoid it.

396
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,500
How could I kneel down

397
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
and beg him to marry me?

398
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,940
Why are you afraid of me?

399
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,580
Because you're so scary.

400
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,500
You threatened me to have a dream,

401
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,780
followed me home,

402
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,180
and slept with me for a night.

403
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Then you used Ms. An as a kidnapper

404
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,660
to force me to cooperate with you.

405
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,060
You're a normal person.

406
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,180
You must be scared.

407
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,340
No.

408
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,780
Then explain

409
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,100
why you took advantage of me

410
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,180
and said those words to me in my coma.

411
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,340
The old and the new.

412
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,060
The heroine saved him.

413
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,940
The hero fell in love at first sight.

414
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,620
And finally, he married her.

415
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,700
What?

416
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,660
Is it just a story?

417
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,580
No.

418
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,660
You're so annoying.

419
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,660
Okay.

420
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,060
Since we don't agree on the direction of writing,

421
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,740
let's not write this novel.

422
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,580
I was the one who wrote this novel.

423
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,180
Why are you so arrogant?

424
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,220
I'm arrogant?

425
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,740
Don't forget.

426
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,500
I asked you to write this novel.

427
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,900
I'm the heroine of this novel.

428
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,500
I did everything

429
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,100
that she said and did.

430
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,700
I'm half of it.

431
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,740
Then...

432
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,020
What do you want?

433
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,060
What do I want?

434
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,380
Let me tell you.

435
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,220
Since this story

436
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,340
is shared by both of us,

437
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,380
before she publishes it,

438
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,300
we must agree on it.

439
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,540
You're thinking too much.

440
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,340
It's far from the release date.

441
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,020
I have to say it first.

442
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,820
Did you write

443
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,660
a story that is not suitable for people?

444
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,140
I can't let her know about the evil neighbor.

445
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,380
Let me see.

446
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,180
I don't want it.

447
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
I didn't write a word.

448
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm busy recently.

449
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,660
What are you busy with?

450
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,380
I'll go back and write it.

451
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,220
Bye.

452
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,220
It's well written.

453
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,540
It's good that she saw it.

454
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
I'm dead.

455
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,220
And the heroine was also the boss of me.

456
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,580
I can't use this to make a living.

457
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,300
Am I that scary?

458
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,780
She has such a bad impression of me.

459
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,260
Because you're scary.

460
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,140
You threatened me to have a dream,

461
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,460
followed me home,

462
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,900
and slept with me.

463
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Then you kidnapped Ms. An

464
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,340
to force me to cooperate with you.

465
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,780
You're a normal person.

466
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,820
You must be scared.

467
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,100
No matter how it is,

468
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,900
I did say that

469
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,420
I would kidnap Ms. An.

470
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,340
People are usually scared.

471
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,940
But I'm just saying.

472
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,580
I didn't really do it.

473
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,900
But what else can I write?

474
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,780
The one that she ate was true.

475
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,020
I heard it myself.

476
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm so handsome.

477
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,540
I should be able to

478
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,820
combine her impression of me.

479
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,180
I'll ask about it tomorrow.

480
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,980
Senior, slow down.

481
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,900
It's raining so hard.

482
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,060
Find a place to hide.

483
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,900
You might catch a cold.

484
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,820
It's not raining.

485
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
I'm waiting for you.

486
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm waiting for you.

487
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,860
I'm waiting for you.

488
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,900
I'm waiting for you.

489
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,900
I'm waiting for you.

490
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,740
I'm waiting for you.

491
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,380
I'm waiting for you.

492
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,980
I can't catch a cold even if I'm waiting for you.

493
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,580
Slow down, Senior.

494
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,500
Are you okay?

495
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,780
Slow down.

496
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,500
Don't rush.

497
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm fine.

498
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
Hello.

499
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

500
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,500
It's okay.

501
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,540
Okay, go ahead.

502
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,180
Go.

503
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,060
Go order food.

504
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,660
Hello, what would you like?

505
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,140
Thank you.

506
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,100
Two cups of homemade bubble water.

507
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,860
Thank you.

508
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,140
I want to ask you something.

509
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
If your male senior

510
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,300
met a person,

511
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,660
he might have done

512
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,180
something he didn't like.

513
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,660
But this person

514
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,900
is very handsome.

515
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,100
Do you think

516
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,460
he will

517
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,100
combine his feelings with that person?

518
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,260
Of course he can't.

519
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,820
What are you thinking about?

520
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,540
Senior doesn't like men.

521
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,100
Really?

522
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,100
Yes.

523
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,300
For example,

524
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,220
the senior he met on the run,

525
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,780
Lu Zicheng's fans on the road,

526
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,900
and those who

527
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,500
picked up tissue for him,

528
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,100
he has done all of them.

529
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,980
And then?

530
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,540
And then?

531
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,660
And then there's no more.

532
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,820
What's more?

533
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,260
Senior has his own principles.

534
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,060
It's true.

535
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,580
It doesn't matter if he likes someone

536
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,660
or not.

537
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,860
It's a different story.

538
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,700
What?

539
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,980
I don't need it.

540
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,300
I like to drink milk tea.

541
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,740
Then order milk tea.

542
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,820
How about this?

543
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,380
Let me give you another example.

544
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,580
If there's a guy

545
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,780
who's a little

546
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,700
cunning,

547
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,340
maybe he likes to cheat on someone,

548
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,140
do you think

549
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,340
he has any hope of that kind of guy?

550
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,340
It's useless to win or lose.

551
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,340
I'm telling you,

552
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,340
a guy like him

553
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
can't be with Senior.

554
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
If he has a bad impression of this person,

555
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
it's hard to change.

556
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
And I'm telling you,

557
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,340
I feel that his ideal type

558
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
is always the same.

559
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
He has never changed.

560
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Only people of that kind

561
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
don't like him.

562
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
What kind of people?

563
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Gentle and elegant.

564
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,340
He is polite and warm.

565
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Just like those male protagonists

566
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
in his novels.

567
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
That's it.

568
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
I know what justice is.

569
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
What is a warm man?

570
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
A warm man is...

571
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
Look.

572
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
That's it.

573
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
He carries an umbrella

574
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
and protects him in the umbrella.

575
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,340
That's a warm man.

576
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
For example, in this restaurant,

577
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
he helps him to take the chair away

578
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,340
and put the tableware on it.

579
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Then he hangs the clothes on it.

580
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,340
Then he puts all the three-fingered paper on it.

581
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Xiao Xiao.

582
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
And...

583
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Does this girl

584
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,340
have any

585
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
action or obstacles?

586
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
What's the difference

587
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,340
between finding a caretaker?

588
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Anyway, he likes it.

589
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,340
Do you like it?

590
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,340
I like it.

591
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Who doesn't like it?

592
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
I'm just acting.

593
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Okay. Thank you for today.

594
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
I'm leaving.

595
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
You're leaving?

596
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Bye.

597
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Thank you for the fried chicken.

598
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
It smells so good.

599
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
No, Senior.

600
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
The coach just said yesterday...

601
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
No.

602
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
I didn't say anything.

603
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,340
I'm leaving.

604
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Bye.

605
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Bye.

606
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
Bye.

607
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Bye.

608
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Miss Lan.

609
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
I sincerely invite you

610
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
to have a chat tonight

611
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
and discuss the plot of the novel together.

612
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Your warm friend,

613
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Little Wu Di.

614
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,340
What's wrong with him?

615
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,340
He's so weird.

616
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
He has an event tonight.

617
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
He might go home later.

618
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
I can wait for you

619
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
no matter how late it is.

620
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
I won't be angry

621
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
if you don't come.

622
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Weird.

623
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Boss.

624
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Why are you here?

625
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Why don't you rest for a few more days?

626
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
I'm fine.

627
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
I wanted to

628
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,340
give myself a holiday today.

629
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Get off early.

630
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Why don't you rest more?

631
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Mr. Lu.

632
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,340
Are you feeling better?

633
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I'm fine.

634
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm much better.

635
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
You...

636
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,340
This is...

637
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Miss Ye

638
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
left the key in the ward.

639
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
She'll be back soon.

640
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
It's my fault.

641
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,340
I was so worried

642
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
that I forgot about it.

643
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
I'll go to the park with Miss Ye later.

644
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
Do you want to come?

645
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
No.

646
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
You guys talk.

647
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
Okay.

648
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
What's wrong?

649
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
What's the matter?

650
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Nothing.

651
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
Really?

652
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Are you going on a business trip?

653
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
Yes.

654
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
I'm meeting some partners.

655
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
What's wrong?

656
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Then you

657
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
should go back early

658
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
and have a good rest.

659
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Okay.

660
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
I'll take you to the sports center.

661
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
I've been to so many events.

662
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
You don't want to go.

663
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
I saw the news.

664
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,340
But after the work news came in,

665
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,340
I'm not in the mood.

666
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
I can only work.

667
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
I can't open my body.

668
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
I really want to go.

669
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,340
What a coincidence.

670
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
You sent the key back.

671
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
I can ask you to take a picture with me.

672
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
I'm so lucky.

673
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,340
How about a picture?

674
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
I'll take it.

675
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
So great?

676
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Okay. I'll go to sleep.

677
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Boss.

678
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,340
Are you looking for me?

679
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
No.

680
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Okay.

681
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Come on.

682
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Come on.

683
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Come on

684
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,460
Come on

685
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
Thank you

686
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,220
I haven't lost to girls for many years

687
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,340
Many years, no one has called a girl

688
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,140
Is Mr. Lu chasing you?

689
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
What?

690
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,380
You believe in the gossip on the Internet?

691
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,500
I didn't see the gossip on the Internet

692
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,660
Didn't you go to the police station a few days ago?

693
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,100
He is so scary

694
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,340
So not good at these things

695
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,540
And he asked me to go with you

696
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,500
But I don't want to be with you

697
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,940
Absolutely impossible

698
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,020
why

699
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,940
do you know

700
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,060
We have done a lot of things together

701
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,700
But every time the result

702
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,820
All for work

703
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,460
do you know

704
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,260
Once he asked me to the cinema

705
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,140
Watch love movies across the year

706
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,820
Is it a very romantic movie?

707
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,780
You guess the final result

708
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,420
In the next series

709
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,220
It's a cross-year movie

710
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,020
Divided case

711
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,900
changed

712
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,860
But people will change

713
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,340
You two have known each other for so many years

714
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,220
It's normal to have feelings for each other

715
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,220
Zichen

716
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,340
He is a

717
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,900
Not easy to change

718
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,300
Just like he has been so many years

719
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,420
Always insist on writing with a pen

720
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,900
Others think he must be very sick

721
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,700
But he is that kind of person

722
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,260
and so

723
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,980
He said he didn't like me

724
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,260
He won't like me for sure

725
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,580
He told you in person

726
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,180
He is

727
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,300
Another characteristic

728
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,980
Very direct

729
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,060
Sometimes men are not good at words

730
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,020
What he said

731
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,100
You should think about it

732
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,900
This arm is really sore

733
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,740
Need to go home and press it

734
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,700
Really have a good rest

735
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,620
And you need to apply hot water

736
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,020
Otherwise it's really not possible

737
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,180
My wife called me

738
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,340
it is good

739
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,180
Hello

740
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,020
Hello

741
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Then let's be in the hospital

742
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,060
it is good

743
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,300
Then I'll go first

744
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,260
Bye bye

745
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,900
Bye bye

746
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,620
Are you ready?

747
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,260
Mom

748
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,340
I'm going to the opposite to find Xiaochong

749
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,620
I just developed a new dish

750
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,860
Bring some to him

751
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,180
OK

752
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,540
Xiao Budi

753
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,140
My mother's task

754
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,740
Why don't you turn on the light

755
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Is the light broken

756
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,100
Don't move

757
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
I'm sorry

758
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,420
I'm sorry

759
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,220
I'm sorry

760
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,020
I'm sorry

761
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,820
I'm sorry

762
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,620
