[Mr. Bad]

3
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,190
[Episode 14]

4
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,940
You and your teammates

5
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,539
had a good time.

6
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,810
You

7
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,780
ate, drank, and talked

8
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,820
freely.

9
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,330
To me,

10
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,180
they are like Sisi.

11
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,640
You talked about everything.

12
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,570
No.

13
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,050
They are

14
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,140
good brothers.

15
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,860
We train together

16
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,150
and sweat together.

17
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,460
So, to me,

18
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,860
they are like Sisi.

19
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
We are carefree.

20
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,380
What about me?

21
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,530
You?

22
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,340
To you, am I

23
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,370
like Sisi?

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,020
Of course not.

25
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,780
In what way?

26
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,700
You are not my classmate.

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,900
What am I to you?

28
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,380
You are...

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,579
You summoned me.

30
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,490
I'm your neighbour.

31
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,170
I write a novel with you.

32
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,180
I...

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,780
I don't know what to say

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,180
but when you're with me,

35
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,900
you are not

36
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,210
as carefree.

37
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,430
Do you want to be my brother too?

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,060
No.

39
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,780
Since we

40
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,630
are writing a novel together,

41
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,380
you are my

42
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,760
business partner.

43
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,780
Business partner.

44
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,700
Well?

45
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,260
You are my sole business partner now.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,040
You're not the same as others.

47
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,210
[Never mind.]

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,850
[At least, I'm the only one.]

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,700
Now?

50
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,220
With me around,

51
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,910
you don't need anyone else.

52
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,020
How is your

53
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,700
writing progress?

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Have you started?

55
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,100
I wrote the beginning.

56
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,540
Why didn't you

57
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,660
tell me?

58
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,220
I think you won't like it.

59
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,260
What did you write?

60
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,850
[Man in Black: Butt out and leave.
Xiao Wudi: Her business is my business.]

61
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,020
[Come what may.]

62
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,870
[Laugh at me if you want to.]

63
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,480
First, let me say this.

64
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,540
The paragraph after
the one about Xiao Wudi

65
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,500
defeating the man

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,940
in black is a work of art.

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,899
It's not a conjecture about you.

68
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,500
I know.

69
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,460
Do you?

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,340
Good.

71
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,040
What do you think about the latter parts?

72
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,940
They are okay.

73
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,180
Compared to the novels I've read,

74
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,060
this is good

75
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,340
but your hero

76
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,000
for the martial arts route

77
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,580
is lame.

78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,340
It's so fake.

79
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,180
Never mind.

80
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,170
I'll help you

81
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,820
beef it up.

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,860
Really?

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,900
I feel

84
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,580
this paragraph is a bit lame.

85
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,540
Don't be too happy.

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,710
This is just the beginning.

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,620
How about

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,420
you

89
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,020
come over here

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
every night

91
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,700
for a meeting with me?

92
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,980
We'll start by meticulously arranging
the outline.

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,900
Your content is too arbitrary.

94
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,580
Outline?

95
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,760
When did you

96
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,020
become professional?

97
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,820
I promised you

98
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
I will improve it.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,500
Of course, I will be careful.

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,420
One more thing.

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,620
About the names

102
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,420
of the characters in your novel.

103
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,820
Must you use birth names?

104
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,260
Lu Zichen

105
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,580
is a villain.

106
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,740
You're right.

107
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,460
What should I call

108
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,460
Lu Zichen?

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,659
Delete his name.

110
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,860
After all, they

111
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,550
call him Boss in your novel.

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,500
No point in keeping his name.

113
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,820
Alright.

114
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,340
Can I call the heroine

115
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,300
Nan Xiaoxing?

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,860
Sure.

117
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,970
What about Xiao Wudi?

118
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,460
Call me Young Master Hehuan.

119
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,620
Good. Young Master Hehuan.

120
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,260
Anything else?

121
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,460
If not, I'll go back first.

122
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,460
Sure?

123
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,300
Wait a minute.

124
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
See you tomorrow.

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,500
See you.

126
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,780
Didn't I say

127
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,820
I've changed her impression

128

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,900
So,

274
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,540
what do you think?

275
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,900

that approached us earlier?

279
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,060
Although the platform is small

280
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,940

the first-round financing,

290
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,380

investments from
a well-known venture capital firm.

292
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Although its royalties are low,

293
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,700
its future profit-sharing ratio

294
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,540
is very high.

295
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,260
That will

296

cover all the cost.

297
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,010

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,850
I am happy.

352
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,610
I told you.

353
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,100
With my help,

354
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,660
you'll be shortlisted.

355
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,020
Thank you.

356
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,100
[That's my heart-fluttering moment.]

357
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,620
[We'll go together tomorrow.]

358
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,420
Good morning.

359
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,620
From the writing and style,

360
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,420
I can see

361
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,860
many unpolished places.

362
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,340
Because you are new,

363
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,980
you haven't formed

364
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,020
an inherent writing routine

365
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,350
and linguistic habits.

366
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,300
So, this feels

367
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,420
refreshing.

368
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,450
It is noteworthy

369
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,780
that you jumped out of

370
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,770
the inherent character setting

371
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,970
and emotional route.

372
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,340
This is why your story

373
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,900
has been selected

374
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,420
from among all the works.

375
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,170
Generally, in romance novels,

376
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,300
the lead actor tends to be a bit nasty

377
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,740
but you

378
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,940
directly cast him as the villain.

379
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,860
That's

380
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,730
very rare.

381
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,740
Your writing experience

382
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
is not very rich

383
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,780
but you handle

384
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,020
the martial arts part

385
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,740
and

386
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,940
design the historical details

387
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,200
with sophistication.

388
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,310
You must have done a lot of studies.

389
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,460
Not too much.

390
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,300
We usually

391
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,100
do some studies.

392
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,500
Your team

393
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,140
is awesome.

394
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,740
The hero and heroine

395
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,700
you wrote

396
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,550
saw their feelings germinate,

397
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,060
and had heart-fluttering moments.

398
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,340
Also, there are

399
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,360
sparks from their interactions.

400
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,500
The entire editorial staff read it

401
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
and beamed with satisfaction.

402
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,700
The credit goes to Nan Xing.

403
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,700
Most of what you said

404
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,230
were her inspirations.

405
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,180
Next,

406
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,530
look at the contract.

407
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,140
Okay?

408
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,260
If possible,

409
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
the story should be continued.

410
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,620
Okay.

411
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,500
Half a month.

412
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,260
We'll wait for the good news.

413
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,020
You can do it.

414
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:04,980
Okay?

415
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,500
Okay.

416
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,260
Boss.

417
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,300
Boss.

418
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,350
Why are you here?

419
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,760
Miss Ye asked them over

420
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,300
to discuss the contract for the novel.

421
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Miss Ye?

422
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,250
Has she come back?

423
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,390
She came back early.

424
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,180
Okay.

425
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,260
Alright.

426
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,650
I won't see you out.

427
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,380
Bye-bye.

428
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,460
Okay. Don't see me out.

429
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,780
Go back to work.

430
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,859
Okay.

431
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,980
Wait a minute.

432
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,150
I'll pick you up after work.

433
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,140
Ye Qing, you are back.

434
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,940
What's up?

435
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,180
What is it?

436
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,900
I drop by to see you.

437
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,740
What's there to see?

438
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,420
I read the item you reminded me

439
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,660
to read.

440
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,580
I'm surprised
that Nan Xing could write.

441
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
What do you think?

442
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,720
It has bright spots

443
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,700
but I think the love route

444
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,420
is a bit of a problem.

445
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,060
What problem?

446
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,250
The hero

447
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,500
time travelled

448
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,640
from ancient times

449
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,100
but he has a high IQ and EQ.

450
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,540
As for the heroine,

451
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,540
apart from being physically fit,

452
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,200
everything else is ordinary.

453
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,100
So, why would

454
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,860
the hero

455
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,010
like the heroine?

456
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,820
Love

457
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,380
is illogical.

458
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,620
I'm just telling the truth.

459
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,740
It's also about real-world logic.

460
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,600
Such a great man will, in reality,

461
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,540
like excellent women.

462
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,020
Forget it.

463
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,980
The love domain

464
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,660
is too hard for you.

465
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,160
You are Nan Xing's favourite writer.

466
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,460
Your evaluation

467
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,940
will affect her enthusiasm.

468
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,860
Leave this matter

469
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,520
to the Editorial Department.

470
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,780
What did you want to ask me last time?

471
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,780
Did you say lately

472
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,740
I...

473
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,220
I sent you a message

474
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,550
but you didn't respond.

475
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
I wanted to ask you

476
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,580
if you are interested in me?

477
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,260
I didn't say that.

478
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,830
Someone else asked.

479
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,900
Well...

480
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,930
How did you answer?

481
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,500
I said that's absurd.

482
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,740
For years,

483
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
we were coworkers.

484
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,500
In the future, ditto.

485
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,100
Right?

486
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,780
Hello.

487
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,210
Okay.

488
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,580
Is it tomorrow?

489
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,900
Let me check my schedule.

490
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,260
Okay.

491
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,940
Just coworkers?

492
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,050
Is the love domain

493
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,300
so difficult?

494
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,450
Are we walking home?

495
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,780
Don't you think the scenery tonight

496
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,060
is pretty?

497
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,740
I don't need it. I'm not cold.

498
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,820
Wear it.

499
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,820
Keep it as a spare.

500
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,660
Why are you so thoughtful today?

501
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm helping you to write.

502
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,700
Write?

503
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,780
Didn't you say you haven't been on a date

504
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,900
and that writing this

505
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,740
feels particularly surreal?

506
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,420
Today, I'll

507
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,940
let you experience life.

508
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,260
So, are we dating?

509
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,420
Don't

510
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,220
regard me as me

511
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,480
but as

512
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,300
Xiao Wudi.

513
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,140
Aren't you Xiao Wudi?

514
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:41,980
I mean,

515
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,860
regard me

516
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,500
as Xiao Wudi in the novel.

517
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,980
Okay?

518
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,940
What was

519
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,340
the storyline?

520
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,100
The hero and heroine

521
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,420
have a meal together,

522
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,670
watch a movie together,

523
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,950
take a stroll together,

524
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,300
and date each other.

525
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,460
The hero puts a coat on the heroine

526
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,780
and then

527
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,840
hold hands for the first time.

528
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,990
Do you want to try that?

529
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,980
That's how it should feel.

530
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's walk.

531
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,660
[Is this a heart-fluttering feeling?]

532
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,320
[It's like being electrocuted.]

533
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,020
[Say it again.]

534
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,560
[Say it again.]

535
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,380
[He was the first man]

536
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,440
[to confess to me.]

537
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,730
[I rejected him.]

538
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,860
[Say it again.]

539
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,140
[Get out.]

540
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,940
[Say it again.]

541
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,000
[What did you say?]

542
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,180
[You want to be my boyfriend]

543
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,780
[and want to see me.]

544
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,780
[Get out.]

545
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,380
That's not right.

546
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,260
Initially,

547
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,180
I just wanted her
to spend more time with me.

548
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,260
Why do I want more and more?

549
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,700
It can't be that I really

550
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,620
want to be her boyfriend?

551
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,020
Hello, I'm Xiao Wudi.

552
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,820
Young Master Hehuan
and king of martial arts.

553
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,940
Can you be my girlfriend?

554
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,420
No.

555
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,060
How can I say that?

556
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,890
How can I possibly

557
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,300
say that?

558
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,020
What if she says yes?

559
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,140
Then,

560
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,140
I'll be with her every day,

561
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,380
obey

562
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,180
her,

563
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,620
get

564
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,700
married,

565
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,580
and have babies.

566
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,940
I'll fall completely.

567
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,100
No. No.

568
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,260
How can I fall?

569
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,860
So, what if I fall?

570
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,620
No, no, no.

571
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,180
Come in.

572
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,020
Miss Ye.

573
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,100
Sit down.

574
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,780
Have you

575
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,460
and Xiao Wudi read the contract?

576
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,320
Any questions?

577
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,020
We read it.

578
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,210
It should be okay.

579
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,260
I think with your ability,

580
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,260
you can write on your own.

581
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:16,860
Why

582
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,550
must you include Xiao Wudi?

583
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,860
Xiao Wudi gave me

584
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,550
many raw material sources.

585
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,700
Without him,

586
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,460
I can't write this novel.

587
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,130
Okay.

588
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,960
You still have a long way to go.

589
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,900
Keep going.

590
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,990
It's the Little King Kong.

591
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,070
It's so cute. Where did you get it?

592
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,680
This is a memory for

593
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,620
my friend and I

594
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,610
from long ago.

595
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,340
Get busy.

596
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,260
Okay.

597
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,660
Why are you sighing?

598
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,690
Is the love domain

599
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,700
so hard for me?

600
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,980
No wonder you couldn't get her

601
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,910
after this long.

602
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,500
Have you ever been in love?

603
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,840
What's so hard about falling in love?

604
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,540
Falling in love

605
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,780
means two people

606
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,380
sticking together every day

607
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,420
and you obey her.

608
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,860
Later,

609
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
you get married

610
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,180
and have a baby.

611
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,100
Love

612
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,860
requires two people to fall together.

613
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,550
Is that hard?

614
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,220
After the manuscripts are collected,

615
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,580
we'll hold a PEN congress for

616
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,540
all the writers.

617
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,660
Mr. Shi,

618
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,500
the Editorial Department
will be in charge.

619
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:19,940
Okay.

620
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,740
Any other questions?

621
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,340
No.

622
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,630
Meeting adjourned.

623
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,220
Ye Qing,

624
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,470
I've figured it out.

625
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,300
What?

626
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,930
I went back and repeatedly

627
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,660
read Nan Xing's novel.

628
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,330
I feel that my criticism

629
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,500
was biased.

630
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,220
Look.

631
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,850
In a suspense story,

632
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,020
a criminal commits a crime

633
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,900
for a reason.

634
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,860
It might not be

635
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,060
a sufficient reason.

636
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,820
If the crime becomes a reality,

637
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,500
the story is established.

638
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,740
What does it have to do

639
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,940
with my novel?

640
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,080
This reasoning

641
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,420
applies to love stories.

642
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,480
In a relationship,

643
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,140
even if one

644
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,160
has unrequited

645
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,180
feelings,

646
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,000
if the love becomes a reality,

647
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,580
the story is established.

648
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,540
So, what

649
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,620
I said before...

650
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,980
I know

651
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,860
your friend.

652
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,860
Nan Xing.

653
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,180
brief Xiao Wudi

654
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,710
about today's meeting.

655
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,300
Okay.

656
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,820
How was my feedback just now?

657
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,860
Pretty good.

658
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,530
Are you still angry?

659
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,420
I've never been angry at you.

660
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,260
Are you free tomorrow?

661
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,980
Did you forget

662
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,950
about tomorrow?

663
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,440
[PEN Congress]

664
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,300
Pen conference.

665
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,340
Two days and one night.

666
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,980
A single man and woman.

667
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,140
No, that's embarrassing.

668
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,860
Nan Xing,

669
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,380
what’s wrong?

670
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,650
I...

671
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,020
Why are your ears red?

672
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,540
Do you have a fever?

673
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,630
Let me touch you.

674
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,060
No, no.

675
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,350
Miss Jiao, I feel hot

676
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,140
because I wear too much clothing.

677
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,180
I have work to do.

678
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,340
Hot?

679
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,590
[To be continued.]

680
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,680
I sent you the plan for the finale.

681
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
I'm reading it.

682
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,460
[Should I ask him along?]

683
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,940
The changes are fine.

684
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,690
If they're fine,

685
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,620
I'll proofread

686
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,940
and send it to the company tomorrow.

687
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,500
Okay.

688
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,340
It's still early.

689
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,540
Are you hungry?

690
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,340
I'll cook something for you.

691
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,770
Okay.

692
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
I'll help you.

693
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,510
What do you want?

694
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,980
Ham sausage omelette.

695
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,420
Okay.

696
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,380
Do you know

697
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,220
how to open

698
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,840
the sausage in one second?

699
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,810
Awesome. Awesome.

700
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,660
Well,

701
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,420
we've finished

702
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,980
writing the novel.

703
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,780
Next...

704
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,140
The novel is alright.

705
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,620
Next,

706
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,020
we can rest.

707
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,940
Rest?

708

In future,

709

you don't have to come here.

711

you need my help.

I don't need

715
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,850
any help.

Xiao Wudi,

719
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,040
put the ham sausage in,

720
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,880
and add seasoning.

What should I do?

722
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,300
Should I ask him?

723
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,820
Forget it.

724
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,000
It's not suitable anyway.

725
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,739
Ask him.

726
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,739
Ask him directly.

727
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:44,980
No.

728
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,420

827
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,160

want to give them away,

836
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,940

837
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,140
you can call me.

838
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,020

839
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,540
trouble you all the time.

840
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,340

841
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,180
take them to the group in batches.

842
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,980
Are you sure?

843
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,860
Is this okay?

844
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,540
Yes.

845
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,060
Your hands

846
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,080

847
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,580
Where did she go today?

848
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,330
She said it is the high school
founding anniversary celebration.

849
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,370
Is that so?

850

851
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,500
No.

852
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,220
The school

853
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,740
can't accommodate everyone.

854
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,180
Nan Xing is enthusiastic

855
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,740

856
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,340

857
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,100
it's good for her to have fun.

858
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,420

859
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,860

865
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,260

866
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,920
No problem.

867
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,700
I'll just hang around.

868
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,250

869
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,060

870
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,880
You can take this to Mr. Zhang.

871
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
Okay.

872
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,090

873
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,100

874
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,020
is held at the new campus.

875
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,220
Don't go the wrong way.

876
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,490
See you later.

877
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,420

878
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940

879
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:37,860
Yes.

880
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,320
Put the balloons here.

881
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,850
Did you notice

882
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,750
that Nan Xing

883
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,660
has been absent-minded lately?

884
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,640
Is it because of

885
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,420
the novel?

886
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Whenever she writes,

887
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,060
she sighs.

888
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,150
It must be that the plot
of her latest novel

889
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,860
didn't progress smoothly.

890
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,620
What is the plot?

891
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,020
Tell me.

892
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,020
Maybe

893
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,580
I can help.

894
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,940
It's her love route.

895
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,720
Maybe she needs inspiration.

896
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,540
She should ask me.

897
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,060
I am experienced.

898
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,370
In her first love,

899
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,820
she was disliked.

900
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,940
She had a first love?

901
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,700
I thought she was alone.

902
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,860
Her first love failed.

903
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,060
So, she stayed alone.

904
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,660
Who was the guy?

905
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,900
Who else?
