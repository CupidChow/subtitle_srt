1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 2

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Morning.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's going on between you two?

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Where are the documents?

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't push your responsibility.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm busy with a meeting with the colleagues of the PR department.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I asked Yu Fan to help me.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yu Fan, tell me.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Later, Nan Xing said he was going to the business department.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So he took it.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where is Nan Xing?

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What time is it?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why don't you come to work?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Call him.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm here.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Where are the documents?

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was sent to the business department yesterday.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They were having a meeting.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They asked me to put it on the table.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I put it there.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now the documents are gone.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you say?

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I...

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You?

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You think you've been transferred to the government?

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Become a full-time employee.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Such good news.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can you not tell us?

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Congratulations Nan Xing.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Congratulations.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Congratulations Nan Xing.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Congratulations.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Congratulations.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Nan Xing, congratulations.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You don't know.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You are the first successful assistant to be transferred to this company.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are so great.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Congratulations.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sister Qiao.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't be so excited.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How can I not be excited?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Before you, I gave my heart to every assistant.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I was sad again and again.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't be sad.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've been working hard to maintain my relationship with you.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't want to be too nice to you.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But you are so cute.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now you are successful.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Enough, Sister Qiao.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't be so nice.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have a problem, Nan Xing.

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How did you do it?

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm just a little better.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, the boss won't treat you...

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Good morning, boss.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Good morning, boss.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Morning.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Good morning, boss.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Good morning, boss.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Boss, thank you.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is Mr. Ye not here yet?

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mr. Ye is going to the company for a meeting.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He won't come this morning.

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sister Qiao.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you want to organize a party for Nan Xing?

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's celebrate.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can finally hold a party for you.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
A party?

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's make a deal.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Two and one.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The main thing is that all the previous employees have held a party.

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You?

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't mean this.

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I understand.

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Anyway, congratulations to Nan Xing.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Congratulations, Nan Xing.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Congratulations, Nan Xing.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Congratulations, Nan Xing.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Am I dreaming?

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My dream has come true.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't waste the night that I've been with you.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sister Qiao.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can I have a new day at the party?

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have other arrangements tonight.

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Nan Xing, why do you still remember your grudge?

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was really afraid that you would...

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no, no.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I understand.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's just that I have a friend who helped me a lot.

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I want to thank him tonight.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's find time another day.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are so busy.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And...

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Dating...

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Lu Zi Chen, can you not be so willful?

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hello, Wu Di.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you home?

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, I'm just out for a walk.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's great.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Come and find me.

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll send you the address.

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You are the one who knows me well.

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I will go if you don't come out.

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll call for help.

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come out.

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's good for you.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's almost time.

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We are...

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hurry up.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The time for our appointment is almost here.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Can you cooperate?

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The entertainment of people nowadays is very interesting.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I found a person from your valley who has never seen it.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You will definitely like it.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
VR, real-time virtual game.

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How do you know?

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You have seen it before.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You must have played it before.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You must have played it before.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's so silly to bring that thing.

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Try it.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's go.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's go and have a look.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's go.

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me play.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let me play.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Stop.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Stop.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me play.

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's really fun.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You should play it too.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you think this level is too easy,

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll change to a more complicated one.

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No.

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's so boring.

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know.

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you an ancient player playing a modern high-tech game?

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's too complicated.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I should have taken you to climb the mountain or...

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where is the remote control?

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Scissors.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Scissors.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Scissors.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where is the remote control?

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't touch it.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're so bad.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Turn it.

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Behind you.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why did you turn it again?

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why did you press the button?

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This...

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No.

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I...

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm so bad.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hit their heads.

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
One.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There are so many ghosts here.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Move aside.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll do it.

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't block me.

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He's going to save me.

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He's on the ground.

199
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's on the ground.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's on the ground.

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He's coming to me.

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He's coming to me.

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go.

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't go down.

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Block me.

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're dead.

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Get down.

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't block me.

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So awesome.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
These are all for kids.

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What for kids?

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Just for fun.

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go first.

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Little girl.

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you want to play together?

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's fun.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How about this?

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's play this spider man.

219
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's see who can climb higher in the game.

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you stupid?

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Look at him.

222
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So awesome.

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come on.

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Stand up.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So awesome.

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So awesome.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Little girl.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you want to play chess?

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This one.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Can you hold it?

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Are you a human?

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Wait.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I need to prepare myself.

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll push after counting to 30.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Counting.

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
One.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Two.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Little girl.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I haven't counted to three.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you afraid?

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Then I'll count to one.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Stop talking.

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry up.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
One.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Two.

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Three.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I didn't expect that.

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I didn't expect that.

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You are quite childish.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Cute.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Cute.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I mean,

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
cute.

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Cute.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Cute.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I said cute.

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Cute.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Cute.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I said cute.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Cute.

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Cute.

263
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What?

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Cute.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Cute.

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Cute.

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Cute.

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Cute.

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
I just want to say

270
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
Cute

271
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
Happy

272
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Happy is okay?

273
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,680
How do you know my happiness

274
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
is not business?

275
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,720
What business is there?

276
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,360
Even you know

277
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
what business is that?

278
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm thirsty

279
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
I want to drink milk tea

280
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,720
There is a milk tea shop over there

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
Where are you going?

282
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,760
You go to the toilet

283
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll go to buy milk tea

284
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,680
I bought milk tea for so long

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll go now

286
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Hello, Mr. Lu

287
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
Help me push this

288
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
I'm sorry

289
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Please come in person

290
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
May I ask

291
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
why you have to push the goods?

292
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't worry

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,080
We just want to improve

294
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,640
our products and services

295
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
I just want to ask

296
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
She has already made a decision

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,840
I see

298
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,160
Okay

299
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll go to do some procedures

300
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,000
Please wait

301
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,840
Mr. Lu

302
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,080
It's really you

303
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Come to buy gifts for your girlfriend

304
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,880
I bought a necklace for Ye Qin before

305
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
He said the design of this shop is very delicate

306
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,680
He likes it very much

307
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,440
This one

308
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,800
I just sent it and bought it again

309
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I think it's expensive

310
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,800
The necklace is the necklace

311
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
The ring is the ring

312
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
ring

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,640
Yes

314
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,960
If you propose

315
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,400
what do you think is better?

316
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
How long have you been together?

317
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,840
I think so too

318
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,720
But

319
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
I've been with Ye Qin recently

320
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,200
I think he's the one I want

321
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to propose to him as soon as possible

322
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Mr. Lu

323
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You have been together for so many years

324
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,120
You must be very familiar with each other

325
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,400
I have a plan

326
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Why don't you help me listen to it?

327
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm going to use a candle to make a small road

328
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,200
Then use a thousand pink roses

329
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,000
to make a dog gate

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,760
When I lead her to the place where the dog gate is

331
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
I kneel down to propose to her

332
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,520
Wait for her to finish the night

333
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,880
Then turn on the light

334
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,720
All around her

335
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,120
is her colleague and friend

336
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,720
What do you think of this?

337
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,480
Mr. Lu

338
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,600
Is it romantic?

339
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Very romantic

340
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,640
But the occasion is not right

341
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,920
Ye Qin is a person who pays attention to

342
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,000
professional attitude

343
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,600
He won't be in public

344
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,840
reveal his personal feelings

345
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
So many colleagues

346
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,360
may surprise him

347
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,960
But at the same time

348
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,120
will give him a lot of pressure

349
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,320
So I think

350
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
it's better to have a private occasion

351
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,920
Mr. Lu

352
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,240
You just sign here

353
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,280
You help me see

354
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
These few bowls of lotus are better

355
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,080
Thank you, Mr. Lu

356
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,120
Hurry up and eat

357
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,080
The woman I love is proposed by others

358
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,520
The opportunity is coming

359
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
You are here

360
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,320
Milk tea

361
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,400
What is this?

362
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,960
This is a lottery for you at the milk tea shop

363
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,840
For you

364
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,040
For me?

365
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,320
I'm so ugly

366
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,280
My watch

367
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,600
How ugly?

368
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,920
Look how much he looks like you

369
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,920
I have a good name

370
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,680
This is called his little bear Wu Di

371
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,360
When you are at home

372
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,400
No one plays with you

373
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
You can chat with him

374
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,960
I chat with him

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,360
How is that possible?

376
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,120
How can a man

377
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,360
chat with a netizen?

378
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,680
How can't it be?

379
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,160
How about this

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Little bear Wu Di

381
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
May I ask if I am

382
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
the most handsome man in the world

383
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,240
in the world

384
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,000
Little bear will say

385
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,760
No

386
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,200
Is the man

387
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,720
the most beautiful woman in the world?

388
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
Little bear will say

389
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,360
Yes, yes

390
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,400
You are

391
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,320
No

392
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,040
Stop it

393
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,360
You are shaking your head

394
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,200
You are shaking your head

395
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,160
No

396
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,400
I can't be taken away by this little idiot

397
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,000
We can beg ways to young people

398
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,720
You bring me out

399
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,640
to have fun

400
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,840
and buy me a gift

401
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,600
Are you

402
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
having a sabre?

403
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,000
Of course not

404
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,800
It is thanks to you

405
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,160
I am very thankful

406
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,640
for it

407
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,760
Thanks?

408
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,080
It's okay

409
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,600
That means

410
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,880
you can be a horse and a cow

411
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,760
to repay me.

412
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
Little Monkey, did you hear that?

413
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,920
He's asking you to be a horse and a cow

414
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
to repay him.

415
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,400
Come on.

416
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,680
After you get the job,

417
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,680
how is the boss treating you?

418
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,120
He's pretty nice.

419
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,320
Why is he nice?

420
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,200
He just

421
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,040
didn't say he would fire me.

422
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,600
He didn't say he would fire you.

423
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,560
Even if he was nice to you,

424
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,800
that's too low a requirement.

425
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
What can I do?

426
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,080
Every time I see him,

427
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,880
I get nervous.

428
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,400
I can't even speak.

429
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,400
If you were the boss,

430
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,880
would you

431
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,920
think I'm not a good employee?

432
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
I definitely wouldn't.

433
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,240
Really?

434
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,120
Because you don't deserve to be a horse and a cow.

435
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,800
How could I be your boss?

436
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,120
Alright.

437
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,360
How about this?

438
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,440
I'll take care of Lu Zichen.

439
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,680
You really want to help me?

440
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
Or sooner or later,

441
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,640
you'll summon me in front of him.

442
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
I don't want to wait until that day.

443
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
You're right.

444
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Are you lying to me?

445
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
What am I lying to you?

446
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,480
Are you lying to me for money or for color?

447
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Which one do you like?

448
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,000
I like both.

449
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Little Bi,

450
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,800
this job is very important to me.

451
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,960
Don't give me any tricks.

452
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,600
Do you have any other choices?

453
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
You're so lucky.

454
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
But you can't lie to me.

455
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,240
I will.

456
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,800
Mom.

457
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,000
Why are you drinking milk tea in the middle of the night?

458
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,680
Milk tea is unhealthy, you know?

459
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,920
A lot of sugar

460
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
and additives

461
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,800
makes it thick and ugly.

462
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,840
Okay, okay, I know.

463
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm not drinking milk.

464
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm not drinking.

465
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,680
I don't have fresh milk.

466
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,520
How is it?

467
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,680
Is it good?

468
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,760
How is it?

469
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,960
Did you see the boss?

470
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,600
Yes, I did.

471
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
But he didn't like me.

472
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,280
You have so many employees in the company.

473
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,080
He can't just stand there and watch.

474
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
He doesn't have the time.

475
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,880
As long as he's good at himself.

476
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
Believe in yourself.

477
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,080
We, the men, are the best.

478
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
You can go back to work. I'm going to bed.

479
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,080
Okay. Good night, mom.

480
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
He's quite good at playing with the bed.

481
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,760
leeping

482
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,080
Did I close your eyes?

483
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,080
Where do you look like me?

484
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,240
You look so ugly

485
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I have to find a way to attract Lu Zichen.

486
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Start with your clothes.

487
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Who is it?

488
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
My phone.

489
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
What are you doing calling me up so early in the morning?

490
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Here.

491
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
This is for you.

492
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Try it.

493
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
For me?

494
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Why are you giving me clothes?

495
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Let me ask you.

496
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
When you are facing Lu Zichen,

497
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
do you often feel nervous?

498
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I am not nervous.

499
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I feel a little nervous.

500
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,480
That's because your positions are different.

501
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
You have different aura.

502
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
These things are for you to help you improve yourself.

503
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
To build your confidence.

504
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
This is not like my style.

505
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I am not suitable to wear this.

506
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,480
If it's like your style, then what is it called to improve?

507
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Just listen to me.

508
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Take these clothes back.

509
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
From tomorrow,

510
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
you can wear them to work.

511
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Be happy every day.

512
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Go.

513
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I am wearing something strange.

514
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
It really doesn't suit me.

515
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Why doesn't it suit you?

516
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Look at yourself.

517
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Wear it on you.

518
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
How pretty.

519
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,480
How confident and charming.

520
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Are you...

521
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,480
just doubting my taste?

522
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I am not doubting your taste.

523
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I also think this dress is pretty.

524
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
But I never...

525
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Didn't you ask me to help you?

526
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Yes.

527
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Don't you think this job is important to you?

528
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Of course.

529
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Then listen to me.

530
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Let me tell you.

531
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
A person's feelings for another person

532
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
are 70% from his dressing.

533
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,480
So if you want to get Lu Zichen's attention,

534
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
you have to boldly try it.

535
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Boldly change it.

536
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Think about it.

537
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Did you ever imagine that you could be his assistant?

538
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Look at you now.

539
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Didn't you do it?

540
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
So you have to believe in yourself.

541
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
You are wearing these clothes.

542
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
It's absolutely right.

543
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
He must have looked at you differently.

544
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,480
But I think I will still be nervous when I see him.

545
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
I will still be nervous when I talk.

546
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,480
Didn't you say before that

547
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,480
you had a normal communication with him?

548
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,480
That time, it wasn't normal.

549
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,480
He was threatened with death.

550
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
I don't know why, but I had a fight with him.

551
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
What were you thinking at that time?

552
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
I didn't think much.

553
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
I just think he is unreasonable.

554
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Like a child.

555
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Yes.

556
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Just like a child.

557
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
I know.

558
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Maybe in your heart,

559
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
you think he is an idol,

560
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
a god,

561
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
and a helpless person.

562
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
But I have found out that

563
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Lu Zichen is actually a very childish person.

564
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I just said it.

565
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Who knows he is serious?

566
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
You are his boss.

567
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Can he not be serious when you say something?

568
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
There are many shortcomings.

569
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
There are many things that he can't do himself.

570
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
He needs your help.

571
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Just like taking care of a newborn baby.

572
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Besides,

573
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I, Xiao Wu Di,

574
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
sincerely want to help you.

575
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,480
I was thinking that I could give you

576
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
as a gift for your transfer.

577
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Since you don't want to accept it,

578
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
I will see it with my own eyes.

579
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Okay.

580
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
I will try.

581
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Right.

582
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
Believe in yourself.

583
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Go.

584
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Thank you.

585
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Actually, sometimes,

586
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
you are not that bad.

587
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Why are you thanking me?

588
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,480
You should behave yourself in front of Lu Zichen.

589
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Believe in yourself.

590
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Believe in me.

591
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Done.

592
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Then I can go back to my He Huan Palace as soon as possible.

593
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
He Huan Palace

594
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Who is it?

595
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
I don't know.

596
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Thank you.

597
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Good morning.

598
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Good morning, Nanxing.

599
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Good morning.

600
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Good morning.

601
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Nanxing, what are you doing?

602
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
I want to change my style.

603
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
You have changed to a more formal one.

604
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Yes.

605
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Good luck.

606
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
It's good.

607
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Hello, boss.

608
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Boss.

609
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Lu Zichen is actually a very childish person.

610
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
He has many shortcomings.

611
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
He can't do many things himself.

612
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
He needs your help.

613
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,480
It's like taking care of a newborn baby.

614
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Boss.

615
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Good morning.

616
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Good morning.

617
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Good morning, Mr. Ye.

618
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Good morning, Mr. Ye.

619
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Let's go.

620
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Let's go.

621
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
If you propose,

622
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
what do you think is better?

623
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Ye Qing.

624
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Yes?

625
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Are you free?

626
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Are you in a hurry?

627
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
I have some work to do.

628
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
I...

629
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I...

630
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Miss Jiao.

631
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Did I just say hello to the boss?

632
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Yes.

633
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
And I didn't even hit him.

634
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Although it's something that a normal person can do

635
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
the first day he enters the company,

636
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
you finally did it.

637
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Nanxing is great.

638
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's go to the toilet.

639
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Let's go to the toilet.

640
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Oh my god, look.

641
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
The fans are crazy.

642
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Why are they so vicious?

643
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
And this one.

644
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
What does it say?

645
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,480
It can receive thousands of complaints every day.

646
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
My head is about to explode.

647
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Oh, Nanxing.

648
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
You send the complaints of the public account to Mr. Hui.

649
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Print them out these days.

650
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Okay.

651
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Hello.

652
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Hello.

653
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Hello.

654
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Okay, I'll send them to you right away.

655
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Oh my god.

656
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Why are these people still sending?

657
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Yes.

658
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
It's crazy.

659
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Hello, dad.

660
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
Hello.

661
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
If the boss sees these letters,

662
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
can he still ask for a favor?

663
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
There's no way.

664
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Everyone is so vulgar.

665
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
This is the new book planning plan for this round.

666
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Take a look.

667
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Did Song Jiaming receive it?

668
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Have you asked for the details?

669
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Yes, you have.

670
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
If you think there's no problem,

671
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
just sign it.

672
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
I can't see it.

673
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Is there?

674
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
What is he doing?

675
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Does he want to go in?

676
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Boss, I just came to you.

677
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Boss, I just came to you.

678
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Well, the contract of our hand-in-hand signing

679
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
has been discussed by the agent here.

680
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Including the face-to-face.

681
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Then you need to sign it here.

682
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Okay.

683
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Mr. Ye.

684
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Mr. Ye.

685
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
It's okay.

686
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Okay, give it to me.

687
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Then I'll go ahead.

688
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Okay.

689
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Do you think the boss will revive Su Yu

690
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
for the readers?

691
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
How is that possible?

692
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Has the boss revived the person who wrote the death?

693
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
He has not.

694
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
The purpose of Su Yu's death

695
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
is to let the male lead face his past.

696
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Now the purpose has been achieved.

697
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Most readers on the Internet are not calm.

698
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
But we can't be like them.

699
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
We can't be affected by them.

700
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
And there is no clear writing in the current book.

701
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Su Yu is dead.

702
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,480
It's possible that this is just a way of writing the boss.

703
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Su Yu may not be dead.

704
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Anyway, as an old fan for ten years,

705
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
I still believe in the boss.

706
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
These book lovers

707
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
are as calm as you.

708
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Boss.

709
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Come here.

710
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Come here.

711
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Did you say what you said just now

712
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
on your own

713
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,480
or someone else's words?

714
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Don't write in my hand.

715
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
I can write whatever I want.

716
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Can I write death? Can't I write life?

717
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Boss, I didn't mean that.

718
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
I just want to tell everyone that

719
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
you are not the kind of person

720
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
who kills his own role casually.

721
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
But you don't explain.

722
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
So I have to...

723
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I'm sorry, boss.

724
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
It's okay.

725
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Your dress today...

726
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Well, forget it.

727
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Go tell Mr. Ye that

728
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
I've read it and can sign it.

729
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Did you arrange a job for me?

730
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
What else?

731
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Thank you, boss.

732
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
What's there to thank?

733
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Boss, this is the first time

734
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
you arranged a job for me.

735
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Although I was an athlete before,

736
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I didn't have much work experience,

737
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
but as long as you arrange a job for me,

738
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I'm willing to do anything.

739
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Really?

740
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Of course.

741
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Okay.

742
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Then go and help me

743
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,480
check how Mr. Ye is feeling.

744
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Okay.

745
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Mr. Ye.

746
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Come in.

747
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Are you okay?

748
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
I'm fine.

749
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
I just don't get used to it.

750
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You don't look like

751
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
what you usually look like.

752
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
But in the future,

753
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
some work situations

754
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
may need to be like this.

755
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
It's okay.

756
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Look at me.

757
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
I haven't gotten used to it

758
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
for such a long time.

759
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Take your time.

760
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Okay, thank you, Mr. Ye.

761
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
What's the matter?

762
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Boss said he's read it and can sign it.

763
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Why are you laughing?

764
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Boss arranged a job for me.

765
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Then...

766
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
How about this?

767
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Give this to your boss

768
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
and let him finish reading it

769
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
and arrange a meeting.

770
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Okay?

771
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Okay, no problem.

772
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Go ahead.

773
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Boss, this is the document

774
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Mr. Ye asked me to give you.

775
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Is he working?

776
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I fell when I entered the door.

777
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I didn't notice.

778
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
You didn't notice?

779
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Then how is he feeling?

780
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
He's in a good mood.

781
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
He's smiling.

782
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
He's smiling?

783
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Then did he

784
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
wear any jewelry?

785
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Jewelry?

786
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
For example,

787
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
left hand.

788
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Left hand?

789
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Ring.

790
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
I don't think so.

791
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
No?

792
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Or do you have it?

793
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Yes.

794
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
I don't think so.

795
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
No?

796
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Okay, you go ahead.

797
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
So you didn't give it to him?

798
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
But I'm sure of one thing.

799
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
He has a jewelry box on his desk.

800
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
He still gave it to me.

801
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
I've been with Ye Qing lately.

802
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
I think he's the one I want.

803
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
I want to marry him as soon as possible.

804
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Don't rush.

805
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm on my way.

806
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Don't rush.

807
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
I'm on my way.

808
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
What's the bill?

809
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Miss.

810
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
This is the content of the new project.

811
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
I've sorted it out.

812
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Mr. Ye said

813
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
he would have a meeting today.

814
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
I've also joined the boss's new business list.

815
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Did I miss something?

816
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
I can change it again.

817
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
You're really

818
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
the first assistant

819
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
to succeed in the company.

820
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
It's your first time

821
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
to do such a big job.

822
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
You've done it in the afternoon.

823
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Is it fast?

824
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Just average.

825
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
But it's your first time

826
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
to do such a big job.

827
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
It's already good.

828
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Keep it up, little boy.

829
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Okay.

830
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Thank you, Miss.

831
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
You go ahead.

832
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I have something to do.

833
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Bye.

834
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Bye, Miss.

835
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Bye.

836
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Hello.

837
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
How are you today?

838
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Any progress?

839
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
I'm fine today.

840
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
He arranged a job for me.

841
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
I need to talk to him.

842
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
That's good.

843
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Congratulations.

844
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
What are you doing now?

845
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
I'm off work now.

846
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
I'll be back soon.

847
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Did he get off work?

848
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Did he get off work?

849
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
He seems to be

850
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
still in the office.

851
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I mean,

852
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
how can a boss

853
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
go home

854
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
before he gets off work?

855
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
You have to stay.

856
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Stay?

857
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Why should I stay?

858
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,480
He didn't arrange a job for me.

859
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
I don't even know

860
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
what I should do.

861
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Is it the first time

862
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
he asked you to work today?

863
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Did he talk to you?

864
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Yes.

865
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
That means it's useful.

866
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
He saw you.

867
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
You have to seize the opportunity.

868
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
And the assistant

869
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
has to be on standby at any time.

870
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
You have to compensate him for the whole afternoon.

871
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
You're right.

872
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
I should stay

873
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
and study for a while.

874
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Tell Ms. An

875
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
I won't go home for dinner.

876
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
No problem.

877
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Bye.

878
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Bye.

879
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
I'll have a chance.

880
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Mr. Ye.

881
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
You haven't left?

882
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
I think the boss hasn't left either.

883
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I want to stay a little longer

884
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
and get familiar with the work project.

885
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Hello, Jiaming.

886
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
My name is set.

887
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Seven o'clock.

888
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I'll be right there.

889
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Okay, no problem.

890
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
I'll be right there.

891
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Xiao Wudi?

892
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Xiao Wudi?

893
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Why are you here?

894
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
I just passed by the nearby restaurant.

895
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
So I came to see.

896
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
You...

897
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm sorry.

898
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm sorry.

899
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Your boss is still working overtime?

900
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Good job.

901
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Just be patient with him.

902
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Show your attitude to him.

903
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
What?

904
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
The reward for you.

905
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Dinner.

906
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Thank you.

907
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
And this.

908
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Wine?

909
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Help me take it home.

910
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I'll ask for a bed-sleeping later.

911
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
It's inconvenient to stay here.

912
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
I'm leaving.

913
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Boss.

914
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Why are you still here?

915
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm afraid you might need something.

916
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
You don't have to do this next time.

917
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
You can go.

918
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Wait.

919
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
I...

920
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
I'll send you...

921
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
You're not drunk.

922
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
I know.

923
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Well,

924
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
hold on for a while.

925
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Boss, please stand still.

926
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
I'll press the elevator.

927
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
The door is not open yet.

928
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Okay, go in.

929
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Slow down.

930
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Stand still.

931
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,480
I'll call you

932
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
and ask for a ride.

933
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
No.

934
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
No.

935
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Do you...

936
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Do you want to...

937
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,480
What's going on?

938
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Why did the elevator stop?

939
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Let me have a look.

940
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
Hello.

941
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Is anyone there?

942
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
We're trapped inside.

943
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Can you come and save us?

944
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Hello, is anyone there?

945
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Hello.

946
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Hello, can anyone come and save us?

947
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Boss.

948
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
We can only wait here for a while.

949
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Boss.

950
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Boss.

951
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Boss.

952
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Boss.

953
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Boss.

954
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Boss.

955
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Boss.

956
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Boss.

957
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Boss.

958
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Boss.

959
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Boss.

960
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Boss.

961
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
