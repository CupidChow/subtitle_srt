[Mr. Bad]

3
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 14]

4
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,940
You and your teammates

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,539
had a good time.

6
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,810
You

7
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,780
ate, drank, and talked

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,820
freely.

9
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,330
To me,

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,180
they are like Sisi.

11
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,640
You talked about everything.

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,570
No.

13
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,050
They are

14
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,140
good brothers.

15
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,860
We train together

16
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,150
and sweat together.

17
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,460
So, to me,

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,860
they are like Sisi.

19
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,020
We are carefree.

20
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,380
What about me?

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,530
You?

22
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,340
To you, am I

23
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,370
like Sisi?

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,020
Of course not.

25
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,780
In what way?

26
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,700
You are not my classmate.

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,900
What am I to you?

28
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,380
You are...

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,579
You summoned me.

30
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,490
I'm your neighbour.

31
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,170
I write a novel with you.

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,180
I...

33
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,780
I don't know what to say

34
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,180
but when you're with me,

35
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,900
you are not

36
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,210
as carefree.

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,430
Do you want to be my brother too?

38
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,060
No.

39
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,780
Since we

40
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,630
are writing a novel together,

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,380
you are my

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,760
business partner.

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,780
Business partner.

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,700
Well?

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,260
You are my sole business partner now.

46
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,040
You're not the same as others.

47
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,210
[Never mind.]

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,850
[At least, I'm the only one.]

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,700
Now?

50
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
With me around,

51
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,910
you don't need anyone else.

52
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,020
How is your

53
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,700
writing progress?

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Have you started?

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,100
I wrote the beginning.

56
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,540
Why didn't you

57
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,660
tell me?

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,220
I think you won't like it.

59
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,260
What did you write?

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,850
[Man in Black: Butt out and leave.
Xiao Wudi: Her business is my business.]

61
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,020
[Come what may.]

62
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,870
[Laugh at me if you want to.]

63
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,480
First, let me say this.

64
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,540
The paragraph after
the one about Xiao Wudi

65
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,500
defeating the man

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,940
in black is a work of art.

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,899
It's not a conjecture about you.

68
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,500
I know.

69
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,460
Do you?

70
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,340
Good.

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,040
What do you think about the latter parts?

72
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,940
They are okay.

73
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,180
Compared to the novels I've read,

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,060
this is good

75
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,340
but your hero

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,000
for the martial arts route

77
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,580
is lame.

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,340
It's so fake.

79
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,180
Never mind.

80
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,170
I'll help you

81
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,820
beef it up.

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,860
Really?

83
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,900
I feel

84
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,580
this paragraph is a bit lame.

85
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,540
Don't be too happy.

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,710
This is just the beginning.

87
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,620
How about

88
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,420
you

89
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,020
come over here

90
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
every night

91
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,700
for a meeting with me?

92
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,980
We'll start by meticulously arranging
the outline.

93
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,900
Your content is too arbitrary.

94
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,580
Outline?

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,760
When did you

96
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,020
become professional?

97
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,820
I promised you

98
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
I will improve it.

99
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
Of course, I will be careful.

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,420
One more thing.

101
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,620
About the names

102
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,420
of the characters in your novel.

103
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,820
Must you use birth names?

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,260
Lu Zichen

105
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,580
is a villain.

106
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,740
You're right.

107
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,460
What should I call

108
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,460
Lu Zichen?

109
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,659
Delete his name.

110
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,860
After all, they

111
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,550
call him Boss in your novel.

112
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,500
No point in keeping his name.

113
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,820
Alright.

114
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,340
Can I call the heroine

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,300
Nan Xiaoxing?

116
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,860
Sure.

117
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,970
What about Xiao Wudi?

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,460
Call me Young Master Hehuan.

119
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,620
Good. Young Master Hehuan.

120
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,260
Anything else?

121
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,460
If not, I'll go back first.

122
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,460
Sure?

123
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,300
Wait a minute.

124
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
See you tomorrow.

125
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,500
See you.

126
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,780
Didn't I say

127
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,820
I've changed her impression

128
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,820

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,900
So,

274
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,540
what do you think?

275
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,900

that approached us earlier?

279
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,060
Although the platform is small

280
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,940

the first-round financing,

290
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,380

291
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,500
investments from
a well-known venture capital firm.

292
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,700
Although its royalties are low,

293
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
its future profit-sharing ratio

294
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
is very high.

295
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,260
That will

296
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,780
cover all the cost.

297
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,010

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,850
I am happy.

352
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,610
I told you.

353
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,100
With my help,

354
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,660
you'll be shortlisted.

355
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,020
Thank you.

356
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,100
[That's my heart-fluttering moment.]

357
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,620
[We'll go together tomorrow.]

358
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,420
Good morning.

359
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,620
From the writing and style,

360
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,420
I can see

361
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,860
many unpolished places.

362
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,340
Because you are new,

363
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,980
you haven't formed

364
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,020
an inherent writing routine

365
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,350
and linguistic habits.

366
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,300
So, this feels

367
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,420
refreshing.

368
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,450
It is noteworthy

369
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,780
that you jumped out of

370
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,770
the inherent character setting

371
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,970
and emotional route.

372
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,340
This is why your story

373
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,900
has been selected

374
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,420
from among all the works.

375
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,170
Generally, in romance novels,

376
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,300
the lead actor tends to be a bit nasty

377
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,740
but you

378
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,940
directly cast him as the villain.

379
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,860
That's

380
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,730
very rare.

381
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,740
Your writing experience

382
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
is not very rich

383
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,780
but you handle

384
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
the martial arts part

385
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,740
and

386
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,940
design the historical details

387
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,200
with sophistication.

388
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,310
You must have done a lot of studies.

389
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,460
Not too much.

390
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,300
We usually

391
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,100
do some studies.

392
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
Your team

393
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,140
is awesome.

394
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,740
The hero and heroine

395
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,700
you wrote

396
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,550
saw their feelings germinate,

397
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,060
and had heart-fluttering moments.

398
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,340
Also, there are

399
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,360
sparks from their interactions.

400
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,500
The entire editorial staff read it

401
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
and beamed with satisfaction.

402
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,700
The credit goes to Nan Xing.

403
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,700
Most of what you said

404
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,230
were her inspirations.

405
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,180
Next,

406
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,530
look at the contract.

407
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,140
Okay?

408
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
If possible,

409
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
the story should be continued.

410
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,620
Okay.

411
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,500
Half a month.

412
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,260
We'll wait for the good news.

413
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,020
You can do it.

414
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,980
Okay?

415
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,500
Okay.

416
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,260
Boss.

417
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,300
Boss.

418
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,350
Why are you here?

419
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,760
Miss Ye asked them over

420
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,300
to discuss the contract for the novel.

421
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,900
Miss Ye?

422
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,250
Has she come back?

423
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,390
She came back early.

424
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,180
Okay.

425
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,260
Alright.

426
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,650
I won't see you out.

427
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,380
Bye-bye.

428
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,460
Okay. Don't see me out.

429
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,780
Go back to work.

430
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,859
Okay.

431
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,980
Wait a minute.

432
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,150
I'll pick you up after work.

433
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,140
Ye Qing, you are back.

434
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,940
What's up?

435
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,180
What is it?

436
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,900
I drop by to see you.

437
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,740
What's there to see?

438
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,420
I read the item you reminded me

439
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,660
to read.

440
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,580
I'm surprised
that Nan Xing could write.

441
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
What do you think?

442
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,720
It has bright spots

443
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
but I think the love route

444
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,420
is a bit of a problem.

445
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,060
What problem?

446
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,250
The hero

447
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,500
time travelled

448
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,640
from ancient times

449
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,100
but he has a high IQ and EQ.

450
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,540
As for the heroine,

451
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,540
apart from being physically fit,

452
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,200
everything else is ordinary.

453
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,100
So, why would

454
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,860
the hero

455
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,010
like the heroine?

456
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,820
Love

457
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,380
is illogical.

458
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,620
I'm just telling the truth.

459
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,740
It's also about real-world logic.

460
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,600
Such a great man will, in reality,

461
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,540
like excellent women.

462
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,020
Forget it.

463
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,980
The love domain

464
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,660
is too hard for you.

465
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,160
You are Nan Xing's favourite writer.

466
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,460
Your evaluation

467
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,940
will affect her enthusiasm.

468
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,860
Leave this matter

469
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,520
to the Editorial Department.

470
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,780
What did you want to ask me last time?

471
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,780
Did you say lately

472
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,740
I...

473
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,220
I sent you a message

474
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,550
but you didn't respond.

475
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
I wanted to ask you

476
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,580
if you are interested in me?

477
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,260
I didn't say that.

478
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,830
Someone else asked.

479
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,900
Well...

480
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,930
How did you answer?

481
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,500
I said that's absurd.

482
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,740
For years,

483
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,140
we were coworkers.

484
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,500
In the future, ditto.

485
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,100
Right?

486
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,780
Hello.

487
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,210
Okay.

488
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,580
Is it tomorrow?

489
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,900
Let me check my schedule.

490
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,260
Okay.

491
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,940
Just coworkers?

492
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,050
Is the love domain

493
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,300
so difficult?

494
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,450
Are we walking home?

495
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,780
Don't you think the scenery tonight

496
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,060
is pretty?

497
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,740
I don't need it. I'm not cold.

498
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,820
Wear it.

499
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,820
Keep it as a spare.

500
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,660
Why are you so thoughtful today?

501
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm helping you to write.

502
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,700
Write?

503
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,780
Didn't you say you haven't been on a date

504
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,900
and that writing this

505
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,740
feels particularly surreal?

506
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,420
Today, I'll

507
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,940
let you experience life.

508
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,260
So, are we dating?

509
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,420
Don't

510
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,220
regard me as me

511
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,480
but as

512
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,300
Xiao Wudi.

513
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,140
Aren't you Xiao Wudi?

514
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:25,980
I mean,

515
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,860
regard me

516
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,500
as Xiao Wudi in the novel.

517
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,980
Okay?

518
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,940
What was

519
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,340
the storyline?

520
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,100
The hero and heroine

521
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,420
have a meal together,

522
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,670
watch a movie together,

523
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,950
take a stroll together,

524
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,300
and date each other.

525
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,460
The hero puts a coat on the heroine

526
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,780
and then

527
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,840
hold hands for the first time.

528
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,990
Do you want to try that?

529
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,980
That's how it should feel.

530
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's walk.

531
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,660
[Is this a heart-fluttering feeling?]

532
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,320
[It's like being electrocuted.]

533
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,020
[Say it again.]

534
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,560
[Say it again.]

535
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,380
[He was the first man]

536
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,440
[to confess to me.]

537
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,730
[I rejected him.]

538
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,860
[Say it again.]

539
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,140
[Get out.]

540
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,940
[Say it again.]

541
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,000
[What did you say?]

542
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,180
[You want to be my boyfriend]

543
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,780
[and want to see me.]

544
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,780
[Get out.]

545
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
That's not right.

546
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,260
Initially,

547
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,180
I just wanted her
to spend more time with me.

548
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,260
Why do I want more and more?

549
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,700
It can't be that I really

550
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,620
want to be her boyfriend?

551
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,020
Hello, I'm Xiao Wudi.

552
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,820
Young Master Hehuan
and king of martial arts.

553
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,940
Can you be my girlfriend?

554
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,420
No.

555
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,060
How can I say that?

556
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,890
How can I possibly

557
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,300
say that?

558
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,020
What if she says yes?

559
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,140
Then,

560
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,140
I'll be with her every day,

561
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,380
obey

562
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,180
her,

563
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,620
get

564
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,700
married,

565
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,580
and have babies.

566
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,940
I'll fall completely.

567
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,100
No. No.

568
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,260
How can I fall?

569
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,860
So, what if I fall?

570
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,620
No, no, no.

571
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,180
Come in.

572
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,020
Miss Ye.

573
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,100
Sit down.

574
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,780
Have you

575
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,460
and Xiao Wudi read the contract?

576
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,320
Any questions?

577
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,020
We read it.

578
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,210
It should be okay.

579
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,260
I think with your ability,

580
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,260
you can write on your own.

581
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:00,860
Why

582
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,550
must you include Xiao Wudi?

583
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,860
Xiao Wudi gave me

584
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,550
many raw material sources.

585
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,700
Without him,

586
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,460
I can't write this novel.

587
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,130
Okay.

588
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,960
You still have a long way to go.

589
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,900
Keep going.

590
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,990
It's the Little King Kong.

591
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,070
It's so cute. Where did you get it?

592
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,680
This is a memory for

593
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,620
my friend and I

594
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,610
from long ago.

595
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,340
Get busy.

596
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,260
Okay.

597
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,660
Why are you sighing?

598
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,690
Is the love domain

599
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,700
so hard for me?

600
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,980
No wonder you couldn't get her

601
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,910
after this long.

602
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,500
Have you ever been in love?

603
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,840
What's so hard about falling in love?

604
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,540
Falling in love

605
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,780
means two people

606
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,380
sticking together every day

607
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,420
and you obey her.

608
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,860
Later,

609
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
you get married

610
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,180
and have a baby.

611
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,100
Love

612
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,860
requires two people to fall together.

613
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,550
Is that hard?

614
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,220
After the manuscripts are collected,

615
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,580
we'll hold a PEN congress for

616
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,540
all the writers.

617
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,660
Mr. Shi,

618
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,500
the Editorial Department
will be in charge.

619
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:03,940
Okay.

620
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,740
Any other questions?

621
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,340
No.

622
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,630
Meeting adjourned.

623
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,220
Ye Qing,

624
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,470
I've figured it out.

625
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,300
What?

626
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,930
I went back and repeatedly

627
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,660
read Nan Xing's novel.

628
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,330
I feel that my criticism

629
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,500
was biased.

630
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,220
Look.

631
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,850
In a suspense story,

632
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
a criminal commits a crime

633
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,900
for a reason.

634
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,860
It might not be

635
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,060
a sufficient reason.

636
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,820
If the crime becomes a reality,

637
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,500
the story is established.

638
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,740
What does it have to do

639
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,940
with my novel?

640
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,080
This reasoning

641
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,420
applies to love stories.

642
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,480
In a relationship,

643
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,140
even if one

644
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,160
has unrequited

645
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,180
feelings,

646
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,000
if the love becomes a reality,

647
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,580
the story is established.

648
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,540
So, what

649
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,620
I said before...

650
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,980
I know

651
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,860
your friend.

652
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,860
Nan Xing.

653
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,180
brief Xiao Wudi

654
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,710
about today's meeting.

655
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,300
Okay.

656
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,820
How was my feedback just now?

657
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,860
Pretty good.

658
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,530
Are you still angry?

659
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,420
I've never been angry at you.

660
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,260
Are you free tomorrow?

661
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,980
Did you forget

662
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,950
about tomorrow?

663
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,440
[PEN Congress]

664
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,300
Pen conference.

665
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,340
Two days and one night.

666
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,980
A single man and woman.

667
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,140
No, that's embarrassing.

668
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,860
Nan Xing,

669
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,380
what’s wrong?

670
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,650
I...

671
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,020
Why are your ears red?

672
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,540
Do you have a fever?

673
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,630
Let me touch you.

674
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,060
No, no.

675
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,350
Miss Jiao, I feel hot

676
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,140
because I wear too much clothing.

677
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,180
I have work to do.

678
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,340
Hot?

679
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,590
[To be continued.]

680
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,680
I sent you the plan for the finale.

681
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
I'm reading it.

682
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,460
[Should I ask him along?]

683
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,940
The changes are fine.

684
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,690
If they're fine,

685
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,620
I'll proofread

686
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,940
and send it to the company tomorrow.

687
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,500
Okay.

688
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,340
It's still early.

689
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,540
Are you hungry?

690
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,340
I'll cook something for you.

691
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,770
Okay.

692
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
I'll help you.

693
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,510
What do you want?

694
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,980
Ham sausage omelette.

695
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,420
Okay.

696
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,380
Do you know

697
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,220
how to open

698
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,840
the sausage in one second?

699
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,810
Awesome. Awesome.

700
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,660
Well,

701
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,420
we've finished

702
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,980
writing the novel.

703
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,780
Next...

704
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,140
The novel is alright.

705
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,620
Next,

706
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,020
we can rest.

707
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,940
Rest?

708

In future,

709
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,590
you don't have to come here.

710

711

you need my help.

714

I don't need

715
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,850
any help.

Xiao Wudi,

719
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,040
put the ham sausage in,

720
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,880
and add seasoning.

What should I do?

722
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,300
Should I ask him?

723
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,820
Forget it.

724
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,000
It's not suitable anyway.

725
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,739
Ask him.

726
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,739
Ask him directly.

727
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,980
No.

728
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,420

827
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,160

want to give them away,

836
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,940

837
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,140
you can call me.

838
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,020

839
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,540
trouble you all the time.

840
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,340

841
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,180
take them to the group in batches.

842
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,980
Are you sure?

843
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,860
Is this okay?

844
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,540
Yes.

845
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,060
Your hands

846
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,080

847
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,580
Where did she go today?

848
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,330
She said it is the high school
founding anniversary celebration.

849
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,370
Is that so?

850

851
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,500
No.

852
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,220
The school

853
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,740
can't accommodate everyone.

854
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,180
Nan Xing is enthusiastic

855
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,740

856
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,340
I think

857
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,100
it's good for her to have fun.

858
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,420

859
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,860

865
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,260

866
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,920
No problem.

867
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll just hang around.

868
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,250

869
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,060

870
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,880
You can take this to Mr. Zhang.

871
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Okay.

872
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,090

874
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,020
is held at the new campus.

875
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,220
Don't go the wrong way.

876
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,490
See you later.

877
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,420

878
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940

879
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,860
Yes.

880
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,320
Put the balloons here.

881
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,850
Did you notice

882
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,750
that Nan Xing

883
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,660
has been absent-minded lately?

884
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,640
Is it because of

885
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,420
the novel?

886
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Whenever she writes,

887
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,060
she sighs.

888
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,150
It must be that the plot
of her latest novel

889
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,860
didn't progress smoothly.

890
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,620
What is the plot?

891
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,020
Tell me.

892
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,020
Maybe

893
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,580
I can help.

894
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,940
It's her love route.

895
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,720
Maybe she needs inspiration.

896
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,540
She should ask me.

897
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,060
I am experienced.

898
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,370
In her first love,

899
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,820
she was disliked.

900
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,940
She had a first love?

901
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,700
I thought she was alone.

902
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,860
Her first love failed.

903
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,060
So, she stayed alone.

904
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,660
Who was the guy?

905
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,900
Who else?
