[Episode 12]

4
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,820
Mr. Cheng,

5
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,740
they might procrastinate.

6
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,650
We should

7
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,900
find a solution.

8
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,660
I

9
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,780
checked the contract.

10
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,340
They omitted some details.

11
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,500
Yes.

12
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,660
Okay.

13
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,820
I sense that there are problems.

14
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,180
We'll confirm

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,020
at the meeting

16
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,620
this afternoon.

17
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,380
No problem.

18
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,140
Hello.

19
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,380
Hello, Mr. Li.

20
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,539
Yes.

21
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,690
I know why you

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,620
call

23
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,810
but we cannot hire

24
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,220
the actor

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,860
because of our company's

26
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,170
future development direction.

27
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,620
I hope you understand.

28
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,780
Okay.

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,020
Please consider

30
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,850
our suggestion.

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,220
No problem. Bye.

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,730
The contract says

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,100
that we may take part.

34
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,420
If they

35
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,500
want web traffic,

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,770
we can sue them.

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,090
We might win.

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,010
A lawsuit

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,620
will take at least two years.

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,020
If we stop

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,380
our project for two years,

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:26,940
we'll miss

43
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,329
the golden development period.

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,610
Don't worry.

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,460
I won't hire the actor.

46
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,220
I know

47
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,579
what this role is.

48
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,890
I will

49
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,220
find a solution soon.

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,890
Have you

51
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,329
been working non-stop?

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,010
I rest every weekend.

53
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,620
What did you do last weekend?

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,530
I played golf with a business partner.

55
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,770
The week before last?

56
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,820
I visited an event venue.

57
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,540
You did not rest.

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,220
You need an actual rest.

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,580
How could I?

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,580
If I rest,

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,260
the whole company has to rest.

62
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,530
You skipped

63
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,010
extreme sports for a long time.

64
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,620
I was busy.

65
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,970
I forgot when

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,380
was the last time I did it.

67
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,540
I've lost

68
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,660
my former self.

69
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,860
What?

70
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,260
What are you doing?

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,020
Help you solve your problem.

72
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,850
I am busy.

73
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,820
Just go.

74
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,450
I haven't changed my shoes.
Where are we going?

75
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:40,900
Okay.

76
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,820
Let's meet up later.

77
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,940
During our university years,

78
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,329
we came here to have fun.

79
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,020
I have

80
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,140
an afternoon meeting

81
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,490
and

82
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,730
must make an appointment

83
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,010
with the lawyer
about the film investors' lawsuit

84
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,450
and...

85
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,180
I own the original script of the movie.

86
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,500
If you don't obey me today, I'll give

87
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,490
the project

88
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,500
to someone.

89
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,089
Your job today

90
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,130
is to take a good rest.

91
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,380
I want you

92
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,820
to get away from your work

93
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,660
and like you said,

94
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,740
find your old self.

95
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,820
Hello!

96
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,540
Hello!

97
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,540
I've warmed up.

98
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,450
We can start.

99
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,409
Long time no see, Xiaogao.

100
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,490
Hello, long time no see.

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,530
You haven't changed.

102
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,130
Join us?

103
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,340
He is afraid of water.

104
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,050
Right.

105
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,290
Just like back then.

106
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,659
Come, let's adjust the board.

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,260
Okay.

108
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,740
I'm surprised

109
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,690
that you still ski.

110
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,820
I always like this

111
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,810
but was busy with work

112
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,410
and couldn't come.

113
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,020
You were the water skiing goddess

114
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
for many coaches here.

115
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,810
Right?

116
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,700
Yes.

117
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,100
I haven't skied for years.

118
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,410
I don't know

119
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,660
if I'll feel the same.

120
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,530
You can. No problem.

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,100
Let's do it.

122
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,090
Not coming?

123
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,580
I'll go first.

124
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,530
Come!

125
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,060
You can do it.

126
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,980
Let's go!

127
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,370
Let's go.

128
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,410
Let's go.

129
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,220
You got this!

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,010
You got this, Ye Qing.

131
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,100
You got this.

132
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,060
You got this, Ye Qing.

133
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,540
You can do it!

134
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,659
I haven't had this much fun

135
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,260
in a long time!

136
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,380
Thank you, Zichen.

137
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,180
What for?

138
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,620
For dragging me here.

139
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,659
Don't mention it.

140
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,210
You looked

141
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,140
excited.

142
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,860
Did you de-stress?

143
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,010
Let me tell you.

144
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,700
Just now,

145
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,860
when I fell,

146
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,220
my mind became clear.

147
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,900
It's just a lawsuit.

148
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,780
If it takes two or five years,

149
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,420
we'll sue

150
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,780
until the copyright expires.

151
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,140
I'm not scared.

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,660
Ye Qing,

153
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,940
I booked the bungee jump.

154
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,820
Okay.

155
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,890
Let's go.

156
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,610
There is a good bungee jump site

157
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,500
nearby.

158
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,690
I'll jump first

159
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,860
before we go back.

160
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,700
Let's go.

161
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,050
I'll go too.

162
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,610
Isn't it boring just watching?

163
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,850
I'm not watching.

164
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,620
I...

165
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,970
I'll jump too.

166
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,650
Don't you have acrophobia?

167
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,780
No.

168
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,280
Let's go.

169
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,300
You can do it.

170
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,580
Come.

171
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,900
It's so high.

172
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,900
Are you okay?

173
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,340
Really?

174
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,700
Are you first?

175
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,130
I'll go first.

176
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,300
I can do it.

177
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,380
Here.

178
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,620
Here. Ready. Walk forward.

179
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:04,100
[Warning! These stunts are dangerous.
Do not attempt any of the stunts.]

180
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,780

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,860
but how do you repay me?

358
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,570
Fine.

359
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,620
I'll also write an article about you

360
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,740
to remind you

361
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,420
about the truth.

362
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,060
Where should I start?

363
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,930
Xiao Wudi, Young Master Hehuan,

364
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
is

365
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,020
a great hero respected by everyone.

366
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,860
One day,

367
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,540
he was suddenly summoned

368
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,180
to this real world, where danger
lurks on every side.

369
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,090
Is

370
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,140
this handsome guy

371
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,050
sent by heaven?

372
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,250
Why is he still asleep?

373
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,570
Maybe

374
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,330
I'll wake you up with a kiss.

375
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,220
He looks dignified

376
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,500
and suave.

377
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,620
How dare you

378
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,050
take advantage of me

379
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,250
and make sexual advances?

380
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,130
I was

381
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,370
attracted to you.

382
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,220
Please forgive me.

383
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,740
Young Master, please have breakfast.

384
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,090
Is it unappetizing?

385
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,820
I just woke up and have no appetite.

386
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,020
Didn't you say earlier

387
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,940
that anything less than ten courses

388
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,820
isn't fit for humans?

389
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,010
Young Master,

390
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,860
please eat some.

391
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,730
A woman should keep her distance.

392
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,500
You are flirty.

393
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,330
No one will marry you.

394
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,690
My life was ruined the moment I saw you.

395
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,420
I have

396
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,570
seen your real face.

397
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,620
I will only marry you and no one else.

398
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,730
Ridiculous.

399
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,890
A marriage is not child's play.

400
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,900
I won't marry you.

401
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,140
Young Master,

402
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,890
if you can't marry me,

403
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:25,900
let me stay,

404
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,780
even as a maid to wash your feet.

405
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,060
Absolutely not.

406
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,900
I'll do anything!

407
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,620
No.

408
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,970
Don't leave me!

409
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,450
Let me stay

410
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
and you can have my car, house,

411
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,260
and household registration book.

412
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,650
If I leave,

413
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,100
will you kill yourself?

414
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,740
Yes.

415
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,930
If you dare to leave me,

416
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,370
I'll kill myself.

417
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,460
Fine.

418
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,820
I pity you.

419
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,620
You may stay.

420
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,580
Thank you, Young Master.

421
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,060
[Nan Xiaoxing stopped crying immediately.]

422
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,780
[A bright smile appeared on her face.]

423
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,810
[It's as if her lifelong wish]

424
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,380
[has been fulfilled.)

425
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,850
What's this?

426
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,420
My Hero Master.

427
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,700
Did you

428
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,180
call me home to read this?

429
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,100
The story I wrote

430
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,090
is more suitable

431
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
for our real-life relationship

432
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,410
and fits your real-life

433
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,820
fangirl character.

434
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,820
I'm not a fangirl anymore.

435
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,140
It's...

436
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,100
You

437
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,860
can't see yourself.

438
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,780
How do you know you're not?

439
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,250
Wudi Bear,

440
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,700
do you think

441
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
he is narcissistic?

442
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,690
I am just

443
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,060
giving you a reference.

444
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,580
I'm here to remind you

445
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,860
that when you write,

446
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,020
do not

447
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,020
deviate from the basic reality.

448
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,020
Hasn't he deviated

449
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,740
from the basic reality?

450
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,530
I clearly remember

451
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,740
what was in my mind.

452
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,450
I was scared of him

453
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,820
and wanted to avoid him.

454
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,900
Why would I

455
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,180
kneel and beg him to marry me?

456
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,410
Why are you afraid of me?

457
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,980
You are scary.

458
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,930
You threatened me in my dream,

459
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,210
followed me home,

460
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,620
and slept next to me.

461
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,740
Then you kidnapped Aunt An

462
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,100
to force me to cooperate.

463
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:20,650
You...

464
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,540
Any normal person will be scared.

465
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,610
Wrong.

466
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,180
Please explain

467
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,100
why is it that

468
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,500
when you first saw me,

469
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,660
you said dirty words to me when I was

470
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,740
unconscious?

471
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,940
A handsome guy in ancient costumes.

472
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,650
The heroine comes to his rescue.

473
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,500
It is love at first sight for him.

474
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,380
Finally, he promises to marry her.

475
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,170
What was that?

476
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,290
Casual remarks?

477
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,130
Yes.

478
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,180
He wants to hit me.

479
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,020
Fine.

480
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,970
Since we two disagree

481
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,650
about the direction,

482
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,260
we can stop writing this novel!

483
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,100
This was originally

484
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,140
written by me.

485
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,700
Why are you intervening?

486
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,820
Am I?

487
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,220
Don't forget

488
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,300
that I asked you

489
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,090
to write this novel.

490
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,410
I am the main character in this novel.

491
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,940
I said every word he said,

492
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,980
and did everything

493
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,540
he did.

494
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,220
I own half of it.

495
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,090
What

496
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,500
do you want to do?

497
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,580
What do I want to do?

498
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,900
Listen.

499
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,810
This story

500
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,940
belongs to

501
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,930
both of us.

502
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,980
Before it is published,

503
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,460
both of us

504
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,940
should reach an agreement.

505
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,130
You're overthinking this.

506
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,860
It's far from ready for publication.

507
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,730
I have to warn you first.

508
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,330
Did you

509
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,580
write

510
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,460
something not presentable?

511
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
[He mustn't know]

512
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,730
[about My Demonic Neighbour.]

513
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:54,780
Let me read.

514
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,420
No.

515
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,220
I haven't written anything.

516
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,570
I've been busy lately.

517
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,220
Busy doing what?

518
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,860
I'll go back and write.

519
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,660
Bye-bye.

520
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,850
It's pretty good.

521
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,100
If he sees this,

522
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,620
I'm dead.

523
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,100
I describe

524
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,890
the male lead as the boss.

525
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,010
I can't submit this.

526
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,900
Am I so scary?

527
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,420
Does she have a bad impression of me?

528
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,810
[Because you are scary.]

529
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,740
You threatened me in my dream,

530
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,060
followed me home,

531
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,410
and slept next to me.

532
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,660
Then you kidnapped Aunt An

533
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,010
to force me to cooperate.

534
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:48,540
You...

535
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,420
Any normal person will be scared.

536
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,650
That's why she misunderstood.

537
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,220
Indeed, I said

538
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,700
I wanted to kidnap Aunt An.

539
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,660
Any normal person would be afraid,

540
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,180
but I didn't mean it.

541
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,860
I didn't do it.

542
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,340
What else can I write?

543
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,620
I am right about

544
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,690
she being a fangirl.

545
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,250
I heard it.

546
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,530
I am handsome.

547
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,500
That should counterbalance

548
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,980
her impression of me.

549
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,290
I'll find out tomorrow.

550
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,980
Senior, please slow down.

551
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,980
It's pouring.

552
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,300
Find a shelter or you'll

553
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,100
get a cold.

554
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,890
Never mind.

555
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,020
It's urgent.

556
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,940
Even so,

557
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,410
you shouldn't catch a cold.

558
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,300
Slow down!

559
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:54,940
Hello, hello!

560
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,700
Are you okay?

561
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,420
Coming.

562
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,130
Slow down.

563
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:57,930
Don't rush.

564
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,620
No problem.

565
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,300
Hello.

566
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,180
Sorry for being late.

567
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,930
It's okay.

568
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,420
Okay.

569
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,020
Leave us.

570
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,570
Go.

571
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,580
Order food.

572
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,050
May I take your order?

573
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,580
Here.

574
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,460
Thank you.

575
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,610
Two glasses of homemade carbonated water.

576
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,210
Thank you.

577
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,690
Tell me something.

578
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,450
If your senior, Nan Xing,

579
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,690
meets someone

580
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,220
who

581
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,100
might have

582
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,620
offended her

583
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,100
but he is

584
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
good looking,

585
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,050
will she feel

586
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,020
slightly

587
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,570
neutral to him?

588
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,690
Definitely not.

589
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,220
What are you thinking?

590
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,570
She doesn't

591
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,090
judge people by their faces.

592
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,610
Is that true?

593
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,500
Yes.

594
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,690
Examples are

595
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,700
the senior she met while jogging,

596
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,810
a Lu Zichen fan

597
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,260
she met on the road,

598
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,340
and a nice guy

599
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,980
who picked up her tissue.

600
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,530
she was obsessed with them.

601
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,370
Then what?

602
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,940
Then what?

603
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,170
That's all.

604
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,260
Nothing else.

605
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,690
She is

606
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,690
very principled.

607
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,370
It's true.

608
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,940
She likes men

609
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,020
not because she is

610
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,060
a fangirl.

611
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,370
These are different things.

612
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,930
Have a drink.

613
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,770
No, thank you.

614
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,090
I like milk tea.

615
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,500
Order one milk tea.

616
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,700
Well,

617
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,330
I'll make another analogy.

618
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,580
Let's say there is a man

619
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,610
who is a bit cunning

620
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,980
and perhaps

621
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,170
likes to fool people.

622
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,850
Do you think this guy

623
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,220
stand a chance?

624
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,980
Most likely he'll be eliminated.

625
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,500
Listen.

626
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,300
This guy

627
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
would not get her.

628
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,730
When she has a bad

629
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,570
first impression,

630
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,940
her mind will be set.

631
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,490
Let me tell you.

632
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,980
I feel that her ideal type

633
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,140
is always the same.

634
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,460
It has never changed.

635
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,050
She only likes

636
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,060
one type.

637
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,940
What type?

638
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,570
Suave, courteous,

639
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,980
and righteous warm guy,

640
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,380
like her novels'

641
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,620
main characters.

642
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,770
That's it.

643
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,020
I know righteousness.

644
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,650
What is a warm guy?

645
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,100
He is...

646
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:27,420
Look.

647
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,810
Like him.

648
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,580
He holds the umbrella,

649
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,370
protects her under it,

650
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,140
and holds her.

651
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,380
That's a warm guy.

652
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,340
In this restaurant,

653
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,460
he pulls her chair out for her,

654
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,780
places the cutlery for her,

655
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,540
hangs up her clothes,

656
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,020
and then puts those sandwiches

657
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,860
on the table.

658
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,380
Wait.

659
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:45,900
Then...

660
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,820
Is she

661
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,060
physically challenged?

662
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,330
That's like

663
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,410
having a nurse.

664
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,300
She likes it anyway.

665
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,380
Do you like it?

666
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,820
Of course.

667
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,210
Who doesn't like that?

668
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,380
Of course.

669
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,820
Isn't that just acting?

670
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,020
Okay.

671
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,650
Thank you.

672
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,300
I'm leaving.

673
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,300
Leaving?

674
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,020
Bye bye.

675
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,500
Thanks for the fried chicken.

676
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,100
It is so fragrant.

677
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,540
Senior,

678
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,450
the coach said...

679
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,220
Hey,

680
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,860
I haven't eaten for two weeks.

681
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,980
Let go.

682
00:30:51,940 --> 00:31:16,300
[Xiao Wudi]

683
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,580
[Miss Nan,]

684
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,700
[I cordially invite you]

685
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,460
[to my house tonight]

686
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,780
[to discuss
the plot of the novel.]

687
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,540
[Your warm friend, Xiao Wudi.]

688
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,300
What's wrong with him?

689
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,180
Such a weird tone.

690
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,020
[I'm meeting my colleague.]

691
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,260
[I might be home late.]

692
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,850
[Nan Xing]

693
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:38,010
[Xiao Wudi]

694
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,900
[It doesn't matter.]

695
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,650
[I can wait.]

696
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,780
[I won't]

[get mad over a no-show too.]

698
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,860
Weird.

699
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,140
Boss,

700
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,940
why are you here?

701
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,420
Aren't you on leave?

702
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,500
I am fine.

703
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,980
At first, I wanted

704
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,340
to take it easy today

705
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,220
and leave early.

706
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,010
Why don't you rest some more?

707
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:02,820
Mr. Lu,

708
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,020
how are you feeling?

709
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,260
Much better.

710
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,610
You are...

711
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,290
Miss Ye left her keys

712
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,970
in the ward.

713
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,570
It's my rest day.

714
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,540
So, I dropped by.

715
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,690
It was my fault.

716
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,490
I was perturbed

717
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
and forgot about them.

718
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,410
Afterwards,

719
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,450
we'll go rock climbing.

720
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,330
Come along.

721
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,690
No. Continue your chat.

722
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,580
Okay.

723
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,180
What's up?

724
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,660
Can I help you?

725
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:29,970
It's okay.

726
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,210
Sure?

727
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,340
The day after tomorrow,

728
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,620
are you on a business trip?

729
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,500
Yes.

730
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,450
Business meeting.

731
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,740
I'll meet some partners.

732
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,260
What is it?

733
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,740
You should go back early
in the next two days

734
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,660
and rest.

735
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,530
Okay.

736
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,500
I added you to the extreme sports group.

737
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,570
It held activities

738
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,780
but you never responded.

739
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,930
I saw those messages

740
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,860
but when I got

741
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,540
work-related information,

742
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,780
I lost my mood

743
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,970
and worked instead.

744
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,220
I was busy.

745
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,180
I would love to go.

746
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,770
Isn't it a coincidence

747
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,700
that I return the keys?

748
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,580
I can ask you to go rock climbing.

749
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,460
Thank you so much.

750
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,260
Can you climb?

751
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,540
I won awards before.

752
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,580
Awesome.

753
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,250
We shall see.

754
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,610
Boss,

755
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,060
are you looking for me?

756
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,660
No.

757
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,739
You can do it!

758
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,020
You can do it!

759
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,010
Thanks.

760
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:42,940
For many years,

761
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,980
no girl had defeated me.

762
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,620
For many years,

763
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,100
no one called me a girl.

764
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,820
Is Mr. Lu interested in you?

765
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,179
Zichen?

766
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,780
Do you believe in online gossip?

767
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,860
I don't read that.

768
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,210
A few days ago,

769
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,100
he bungee jumped

770
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,490
although he feared heights

771
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,740
and was bad at it.

772
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,980
He did it bravely.

773
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,940
Isn't he interested in you?

774
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,370
Impossible.

775
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,340
Why?

776
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,340
Do you know

777
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,100
that we

778
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,460
did a lot of things together

779
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,020
but every time, it became

780
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,260
work-related.

781
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,810
Do you know

782
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,730
that he took me to the cinema

783
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,610
to watch a New Year's Eve love movie?

784
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,060
Wasn't

785
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,340
that very romantic?

786
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,260
Guess what?

787
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,450
His next series was

788
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,500
a New Year's Eve
cinema dismemberment case.

789
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,210
Awesome.

790
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,420
People change.

791
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,810
After knowing each other for years,

792
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,730
it's normal to fall in love.

793
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,650
Zichen

794
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
doesn't

795
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,340
change easily.

796
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,940
For many years,

797
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,380
he

798
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,900
wrote with a pen.

799
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,940
Others think

800
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,450
he is sick

801
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,220
but that's what he is.

802
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,700
After he said

803
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,380
he doesn't like me,

804
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,860
he won't like me.

805
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,090
Did he tell you directly?

806
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,540
He

807
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,740
has another quality.

808
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,500
He is very direct.

809
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,330
Sometimes, men

810
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,460
lie.

811
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,410
Think about

812
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,580
what he said.

813
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,380
My arm is sore.

814
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,020
I should go home and massage.

815
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,170
Take a good rest.

816
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,180
I need

817
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,100
a hot compress too.

818
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,490
If not, tomorrow...

819
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,620
My friend is here.

820
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:29,730
Okay.

821
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,570
Hello.

822
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,300
Hello.

823
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,780
Let's meet again.

824
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,370
Okay.

825
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,610
I'll go first.

826
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,580
Bye-bye

827
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,290
Bye-bye.

828
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,980
Are you ready?

829
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,410
Mum.

830
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,420
I'll go across to visit Xiong.

831
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,650
I just created a new dish.

832
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,020
Bring some for him to try.

833
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,100
Okay.

834
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,410
Xiao Wudi, my mother asked me...

835
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,130
Why is the light off?

836
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,220
Is it broken?

837
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,700
Don't move.
