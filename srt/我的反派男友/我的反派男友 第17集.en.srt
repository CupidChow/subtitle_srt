[Mr. Bad]

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,620
Mr. Lu,

5
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,780
I thought you weren't here...

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,620
I'm here to deliver

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,060
this week's schedule to you.

8
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,420
Those meetings that require

9
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,860
your attendance are remarked.

10
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,660
Leave it here.

11
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,060
Have you not

12
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,980
gone home

13
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,690
since the PEN congress?

14
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,350
Is there a meeting for
me and Miss Ye today?

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,560
Yes, there is one at 11am.

16
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,840
Boss,

17
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,500
is there something

18
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,340
happened between

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,140
that friend of yours and Miss Ye?

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,620
If he's not in a good condition,

21
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,620
I could postpone

22
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,000
the meeting.

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,740
Can't you tell

24
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,240
my current condition?

25
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,130
I will attend the meeting.

26
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,650
Cancel all other work.

27
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,280
Sure.

28
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,530
I don't mind all the things
you just said.

29
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,160
But I do.

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
Are you that unsure of me?

31
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,700
Let's pretend nothing

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,250
has happened today, okay?

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,420
During the PEN congress,
we discovered that

34
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,700
most of the authors

35
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,540
very much emphasize

36
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,940
Mr. Lu's opinion.

37
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,760
Hence, we hope that

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,180
Mr. Lu could judge on

39
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,340
those shortlisted pieces

40
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,820
other than just

41
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,100
the Grand Prize.

42
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,060
Will you have the time

43
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,410
for it, Mr. Lu?

44
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,220
Do you mean top four
for shortlisted pieces?

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,840
Yes.

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,290
What do you think?

47
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,380
Four pieces

48
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,650
and a Grand Prize.

49
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,940
Review volume is somewhere

50
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,100
around two hundred thousand words.

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,829
Is that okay?

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,670
I want to know why.

53
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,170
We're talking about the New Star Program.

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,460
I want to know why

55
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,320
you think it will fail.

56
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,340
The president's office will confirm

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,010
Mr. Lu's schedule this week.

58
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,579
He has a

59
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,209
film revision meeting to attend.

60
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,220
After confirmation,

61
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,839
arrange that with Mr. Shi.

62
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,060
Miss Ye.

63
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,770
Hi.

64
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,640
Mr. Lu.

65
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,860
I know what you want to say.

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,260
But I can't pretend

67
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,960
nothing's ever happened.

68
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
You didn't go home last night right?

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,500
I'll order company's driver
to send you home.

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
I don't need it.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright then.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,120
I will take my time off.

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,120
I'll rest for a few days.

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,220
I'll be back after you
get yourself together.

75
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,820
I don't permit your time off.

76
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,380
If you keep on being like this today

77
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,909
in front of our colleagues,

78
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,220
how can we

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,840
continue working together?

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,740
That is

81
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
not what I want, working with you.

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,800
What is it then?

83
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,440
You want me to resign?

84
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,600
I'm fine with that.

85
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,220
But please don't overcomplicate

86
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,440
things further.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,700
Other than the Grand Prize,

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,420
shortlisted pieces

89
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,500
will also be reviewed by Mr. Lu.

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,420
Remember to follow up on that.

91
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,300
And this is our...

92
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,080
Miss Ye.

93
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,760
Hello, Miss Ye.

94
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,180
Summarise those projects

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,860
that I'm involved with from

96
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,780
president's office's side,

97
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,180
including all details and send them to me.

98
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,940
Miss Ye, you're involved with

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,700
all the projects here.

100
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,740
Send me all of them then.

101
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,480
Alright.

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,580
Mr. Shi,

103
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,730
you happen to be here.

104
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,060
Please sort out all those

105
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,460
progress details of
Physical Book Project from

106
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,940
Editorial Department and send them to me.

107
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,460
Alright.

108
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020
I hope that could be done

109
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,100
and sent to my mailbox

110
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,300
before you leave work.

111
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,220
Thanks, everyone.

112
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,700
Alright.

113
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,380
Alright.

114
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,320
Nan Xing.

115
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,440
Come with me.

116
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,820
You want to see Xiao Wudi alone?

117
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,520
Yes.

118
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,020
I want to talk to him

119
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,140
about the script.

120
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,100
But his number

121
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,140
isn't on our contact list.

122
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,740
Could you schedule it for me?

123
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,240
Of course.

124
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,750
Is there anything else?

125
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,580
You can get back to your work now.

126
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,720
Sure.

127
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,420
Nan Xing,

128
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,150
what's the matter with Miss Ye?

129
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,400
Nothing.

130
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,080
Could you...

131
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,460
I'm searching for the material.

132
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,620
Could you search for the form

133
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,440
for me as well?

134
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,060
This is for Circulation Department right?

135
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,140
Yes, and this is for Publicity Department.

136
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,340
Yes, for Publicity Department as well.

137
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,210
Hello.

138
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,980
Hello, is this Mr. Xiao?

139
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,530
We're calling from the bank.

140
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,060
No, you had the wrong number.

141
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,720
Goodbye.

142
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,820
Don't hang up.

143
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm just kidding.

144
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,220
Why didn't you pick up my joke?

145
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,220
You call me this late,

146
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,900
can't I complain a little?

147
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
[Where is the late?]

148
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,260
[It's not even lunch hour yet.]

149
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,020
[I thought,]

150
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,380
[with how much]

151
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,620
[you miss me,]

152
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,940
you could only hold for an hour.

153
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,580
I need to work.

154
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,420
It's not so good

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,409
to have personal phone calls
during working hours.

156
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,140
And I need to finance you,

157
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,460
a boyfriend who doesn't work.

158
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,130
I have to work even harder.

159
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,780
I'll tell you what.

160
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,040
You

161
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
don't have to work hard for too long.

162
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,000
What do you mean?

163
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,940
I have prepared you

164
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,970
a surprise.

165
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,160
What surprise?

166
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,500
If I tell now,

167
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,160
will that still be a surprise?

168
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,760
[Are you available tomorrow morning?]

169
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,890
Why?

170
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,210
You want to date me?

171
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,260
For a trip?

172
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,250
Sure thing.

173
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,730
[No.]

174
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,540
[It's Miss Ye.]

175
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,840
She wants to talk to you about the script.

176
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,760
Date me?

177
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,060
[Yes, and it's one on one]

178
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,400
without me.

179
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,370
I'm telling you.

180
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,300
My boss seems to be feeling

181
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,730
a little gloomy today.

182
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,690
[He seems to have
had a fight with Miss Ye.]

183
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,780
[Then, Miss Ye wants to]

184
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,900
[date you alone.]

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,530
I think it's kind of weird.

186
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,620
Do you think

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,200
I should go and ask about it?

188
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,659
You don't need to ask him.

189
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,140
You'd better not speak a word

190
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,820
[with Lu Zichen,]

191
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,940
[except for communication]

192
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,200
[regarding work.]

193
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,050
Hi, Mr. Lu.

194
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,630
I'm just kidding.

195
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,720
That's really funny.

196
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,720
Alright.

197
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,300
About meeting with Ye Qing,

198
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,690
you can help me proceed.

199
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,660
It's most probably

200
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,320
about the contract.

201
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,100
You don't have to worry.

202
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,180
We will go together tomorrow morning.

203
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,700
Okay, that's it then.

204
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,180
I'll tell her that you said okay.

205
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,500
Today,

206
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,770
I won't have the time

207
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,860
to lunch with you.

208
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm a little busy today.

209
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,160
Then, how about

210
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,260
you come fetch me tonight?

211
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,880
I want to take you to a place.

212
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,490
I'll check my schedule again.

213
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,620
It's fine without unexpected events.

214
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,570
You wait and see.

215
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,050
I'll surprise you.

216
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,800
Sure.

217
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,360
Bye bye.

218
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,520
Bye bye.

219
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,980
Surprise?

220
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,490
Xiao Wudi, you...

221
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,310
Finally, you're off from work.

222
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,330
What are you searching for?

223
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,340
My surprise.

224
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,820
Didn't you say

225
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,350
you prepared me a surprise?

226
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,010
Where is it?

227
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,920
So impatient of you.

228
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,080
Birth certificate?

229
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,080
Where did you get it from?

230
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,680
I photoshopped it myself.

231
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,020
You photoshopped what?

232
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,100
This is illegal.

233
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,660
Once I have this,

234
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,100
I can register an account.

235
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,740
I can register for an ID.

236
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,680
Then?

237
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,140
Then, I could

238
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,410
take the college entrance exam.

239
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,250
Try to think.

240
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,260
With my intelligence and wisdom,

241
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,580
I could effortlessly

242
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,380
get into any famous university.

243
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,010
Just give me some time.

244
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,090
Don't you fancy this company?

245
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,420
I'll spend another three to five years

246
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,060
to tackle into the company.

247
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,660
Lu Zichen and Ye Qing

248
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,460
would be kicked out
by my capability for sure.

249
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,300
The company

250
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,780
will be ours to rule then.

251
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,380
You can do whatever you want.

252
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,860
No, definitely no.

253
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,440
How can you think that way?

254
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,770
What are you laughing at?

255
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,620
I knew you wouldn't agree.

256
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,280
I was just kidding.

257
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,250
I would definitely not do that.

258
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,900
With my intelligence,

259
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,890
I could find a work out there.

260
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,580
Those university professor

261
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,700
positions

262
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,250
are within easy reach.

263
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,900
Or I will sacrifice a little

264
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,050
and enter the entertainment industry.

265
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,240
Don't you worry.

266
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,250
I will definitely

267
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,640
be responsible for

268
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,240
our better future.

269
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,580
Unexpectedly,

270
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,440
you've been so thoughtful for me.

271
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,290
However,

272
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,180
I must delete this one

273
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,600
because it's illegal.

274
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,280
Done, it's deleted.

275
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,840
I photoshopped whole day for it.

276
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,730
You don't need it.

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,320
Don't worry.

278
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,660
I'll take care of you.

279
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,660
Let's go. I'll take you to

280
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,760
a special place.

281
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,240
Look.

282
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,380
That classroom right there

283
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,300
was where I had my classes.

284
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,620
I used to

285
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,640
pass by this corridor everyday.

286
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,660
Those days, I was so envious of

287
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
those who could be in a relationship

288
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,800
in school.

289
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,300
There is even a love holy land

290
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,370
in our school.

291
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,010
It's a lotus pond.

292
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,200
It's over there.

293
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,980
There were many

294
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,760
little ducks in the pond.

295
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,250
There were two little ducks

296
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,740
which always stuck together everyday.

297
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,770
I even gave them

298
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,850
a name.

299
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,900
I named one as Wang,

300
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,360
another as Ba.

301
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
Because together

302
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,040
it means idiot.

303
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,420
Why were you that naughty?

304
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,980
I was thinking

305
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,490
that I must fall in love.

306
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,540
So I could

307
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,300
circle around the pond

308
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,570
with the one I adore

309
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,460
everyday,

310
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,280
and chit chat at the same time.

311
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,380
If we could

312
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,490
circle five rounds each day,

313
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,340
then we could circle

314
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,290
1825 rounds in a year.

315
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,960
1825?

316
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,340
How could you have so much

317
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,300
to talk about?

318
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,380
Isn't falling in love meant to

319
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,440
have limitless topics to talk about?

320
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,610
But that was just a fantasy anyway.

321
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,580
By far,

322
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,310
I did not circle even one round.

323
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,080
So let's go circle then.

324
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,720
Sure.

325
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,840
Where is pond?

326
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,320
Why is it filled in?

327
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,800
It's okay.

328
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,120
Let us

329
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,640
visit your classroom then.

330
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,850
We're almost there.

331
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,250
That's the classroom.

332
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,960
The room isn't locked.

333
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,000
Look.

334
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,700
This is the classroom

335
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
I used to have classes in.

336
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,980
So big.

337
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,180
55, 56, 57,

338
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,940
58,59.

339
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,250
This is the row.

340
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,250
59 is my student number.

341
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,180
So I used to

342
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,730
sit here everyday.

343
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,610
This is the seat?

344
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,200
Who was sitting beside you?

345
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,360
It's the

346
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,560
student number 50.

347
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,000
There was

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,060
a boy classmate that time

349
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,580
who was the English class representative,

350
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
he used to

351
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,660
assign English homework

352
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,980
on the blackboard everyday.

353
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,900
But he always

354
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
put a letter "U"

355
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,500
at the end of the sentence.

356
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,370
None of us understood

357
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,450
what it meant.

358
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,900
Until the graduation day,

359
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,520
we all understood.

360
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,080
What did it mean?

361
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,220
On the graduation day,

362
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,280
he confessed to the girl he liked.

363
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,260
The girl's name was

364
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,840
Lin Xinyou.

365
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,920
Did they get together?

366
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,150
They were together after the confession.

367
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,080
[Nan Xing]

368
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,700
[Nan Xing]

369
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,620
What do you think?

370
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,109
[Xiao Wudi, Nan Xing]

371
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,900
What do you think?

372
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,600
What are you guys
doing here so late at night?

373
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,250
[Xiao Wudi, Nan Xing]

374
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,210
Why so early?

375
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,530
You must be earlier than punctual

376
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,190
when you're meeting someone.

377
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,460
It's all because of you.

378
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,840
Are you awake yet?

379
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,240
Wake up.

380
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,290
It's still early.

381
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,580
Miss Ye shouldn't be here yet.

382
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,640
You wait here downstairs for awhile.

383
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,040
Sure.

384
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,180
You can head to work.

385
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,820
I'll walk around here myself.

386
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Then I will go up and meet her myself.

387
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,340
Remember to find me
after the meeting then.

388
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,330
Bye bye.

389
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,920
Come in.

390
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,800
Have a seat.

391
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,360
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,680
This is for someone else.

393
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,160
Mr. Xiao,

394
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,330
as you have seen at the PEN congress,

395
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,410
of all the shortlisted authors,

396
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,460
the only collaborators

397
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,840
are you and Nan Xing.

398
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,260
So I wish to know more about

399
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,010
the relationship between you both.

400
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,360
Including the sharing of work and profit.

401
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,930
Regarding this matter,

402
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,770
Nan Xing should be able to handle right?

403
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,970
Why did you make me come all the way here?

404
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,500
Because you're a smart man.

405
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,430
So I would like to be frank with you.

406
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,170
I know very well of

407
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,920
Nan Xing's creativity level.

408
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,300
A piece

409
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,220
like Mr. Bad,

410
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,380
is completely original to Nan Xing

411
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,780
both in terms of
writing style and emotion.

412
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,130
So I personally hope that

413
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,980
we could

414
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,180
add profit sharing terms

415
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,300
onto our contract

416
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,120
in the future.

417
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,940
This way we could ensure that

418
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,570
Nan Xing gets what she deserves.

419
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,540
From what you said,

420
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,500
you're worried that

421
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,130
I might take advantage of Nan Xing?

422
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,940
I reckon with Nan Xing's personality,

423
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,820
most probably

424
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,780
she wouldn't talk to you
about the money in advance.

425
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,540
So this is why I

426
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,900
need to avoid the risk in advance.

427
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,240
[She's quite considerate of Nan Xing.]

428
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,300
What if I

429
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,940
really wanted to take advantage of her

430
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,050
and refused to sign a contract with you,

431
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,510
what would you do about it?

432
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Then, I would

433
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,220
use document comparison way

434
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,600
to kick you out.

435
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,260
I have a piece here

436
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,780
written by Nan Xing

437
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,490
before she joined the company.

438
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,410
We only need to do a comparison

439
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,850
to discover that

440
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,050
your contribution isn't significant.

441
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,290
Xingchen's Love Story.

442
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,010
I asked Nan Xing before.

443
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,580
This script's main male character

444
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,170
is also based on you.

445
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,620
But you're a villain

446
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,890
in the novel.

447
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,940
[If Lu Zichen is the great man]

[Xiao Wudi.]

463
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,760
You said

464
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,010
this is written by Nan Xing
before she entered

465
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,840
the company?

466
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,960
Any problem with that?

467
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,780
I used to write fan fiction.

468
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,820
All of a sudden, I need to write

469
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,660
original novel.

470
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,560
I don't know what to write at all.

471
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,890
Wait.

472
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,880
You can write novel?

473
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,960
Why didn't you show it to me?

474
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,100
The novels I write
are all about romance.

475
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,480
You wouldn't like it.

476
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,900
It's very similar to

477
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,620
the first movie

478
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,120
that we watched today.

479
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,240
Mr. Xiao.

480

Xiao Wudi.

481
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,080
Xiao Wudi.

482
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,480
Xiao Wudi, what's wrong with you?

483
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,080
What did Miss Ye tell you?

484
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,410
Is it something wrong

485
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,600
with our novel?

486
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,560
Who am I actually?

487
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,440
You are Xiao Wudi.

488
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,170
Before you summoned me,

489
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,530
you already knew who I am, right?

490
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,620
So I didn't actually travel here,

491
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,360
did I?

492
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,600
Xiao Wudi,

493
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,360
listen to me.

494
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:00,860
I...

495
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,290
I'm only

496
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,210
a fictional character.

497
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,220
I'm a villain in the novel

498
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,850
that you wrote.

499
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm a

500
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,080
notorious evil boss, right?

501
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,980
When you thought

502
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,540
you were someone who travelled here

503
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,490
from the ancient times,

504
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,710
I did actually think of explaining to you.

505
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,560
But I was too afraid at that moment.

506
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,860
I worried that

507
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,620
you would be the same as I wrote you.

508
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,360
So I did not say anything.

509
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,660
After that, I forgot

510
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,720
about it.

511
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,850
Then...

512
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,100
I didn't purposely

513
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,340
hide it from you or try to deceive...

514
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,160
Stop talking.

515
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,780
I'm a little messed up now.

516
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,280
Leave me alone for now.

517
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,040
Xiao Wudi, listen to me...

518
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,640
I can't look at you now.

519
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,940
[Before you summoned me,]

520
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,870
[you already knew who I am, right?]

521
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,420
I...

522
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,780
I'm only

523
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,810
a fictional character.

524
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,980
I'm a villain in the novel

525
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,400
that you wrote.

526
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,060
I am a

527
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,680
notorious evil boss, right?

528
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,760
[Xiao Wudi,]

529
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,160
[I didn't mean to lie to you.]

530
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,050
[Ye Qing]

531
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,390
[Nan Xing, come see me.]

532
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,000
Come in.

533
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,680
Miss Ye, how can I help you?

534
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,570
Have a seat.

535
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,260
I know that

536
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,420
you collaborate with

537
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,300
Xiao Wudi.

538
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,700
You guys are quite close.

539
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,740
I also can tell that

540
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,730
he's a very smart person.

541
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,060
He does things in

542
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,600
an usual way.

543
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,690
But when I showed him

544
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,740
Xingchen's Love Story

545
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,320
that you wrote,

546
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,740
his reaction told me

547
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,020
that I might be

548
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,140
misunderstand the
relationship between you guys.

549
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,640
Are you both...

550
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,880
No.

551
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,260
That

552
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,780
is a trap

553
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,240
that I set for myself.

554
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,540
Am I a little interfering?

555
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,300
What can I do to...

556
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,840
You're fine, Miss Ye.

557
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,700
I

558
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,740
actually did

559
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,370
interfere you as well,

560
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,000
about you and Mr. Lu.

561
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,980
He kept asking me,

562
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,160
so I...

563
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,970
I already knew about this.

564
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,840
You knew?

565
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,880
I haven't told you any of that.

566
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,140
By observing the things he's done

567
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,900
and your reaction,

568
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,120
I've guessed it.

569
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,720
I'm sorry, Miss Ye.

570
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,300
However, Mr. Lu

571
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,850
really cares about you.

572
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,050
He's worked very hard behind the scene.

573
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,170
I know.

574
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,880
I won't blame you for this.

575
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,280
Don't worry about it.

576
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,490
By the way,

577
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,360
I actually wanted to help you

578
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,180
finalize the collaboration
between you and Xiao Wudi

579
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,490
before I resign.

580
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,220
But I didn't expect to...

581
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,260
You...

582
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,200
You said you're about to resign?

583
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,490
But...

584
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,480
If you left, how would the company...

585
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,320
How could the company run?

586
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,920
It's no problem.

587
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,680
Company will be fine no matter who leaves.

588
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
You guys are still here, aren't you?

589
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,520
By the way,

590
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,420
please keep this a secret for me,

591
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,160
okay?

592
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,400
How could I keep it a secret?

593
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,970
How could I keep...

594
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,770
I don't know how.

595
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,640
Don't cry.

596
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,480
Don't cry.

597
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,850
No more beauty if you cry.

598
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,170
You're not cute anymore if you cry.

599
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,680
You're becoming ugly.

600
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:34,740
[So]

601
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,520
[I'm only a fictional character
in the novel.]

602
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
[I don't actually exist]

603
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,800
[in this world.]

604
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,440
[How about Hehuan Palace?]

605
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,080
[How about Master?]

606
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,120
Because I

607
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,330
didn't have parents since little,

608
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,900
so my Master

609
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,720
adopted me since then.

610
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,900
I've been staying in the Hehuan Palace

611
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,380
with him since little.

612
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,690
At least at that time,

613
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,160
I considered myself in a family.

614
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,260
[So everything about me]

615
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,080
[doesn't actually exist.]

616
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,530
Xiao Wudi, are you home?

617
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,840
Tell me if you're in there.

618
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,330
I'm really worried about you.

619
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,200
Mother, I'm home.

620
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,440
You're back.

621
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,520
[No.]

622
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,250
[I still don't know]

623
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,920
[how to face you.]

624
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,040
I prepared seafood feast for you.

625
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,400
You ordered a cake?

626
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,620
It's so adorable.

627
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,220
It can just be our dessert.

628
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,320
This is not for you.

629
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,650
Who is it for then?

630
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,690
Someone gave it to me.

631
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,400
So I can't have it?

632
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,000
No.

633
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,700
You can eat my stuff,

634
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,100
why can't

635
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,530
I eat yours?

636
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,850
Someone ordered me to keep it for him.

637
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,920
You can't eat it as well?

638
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,440
Okay then, forget it.

639
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,790
Wash your hands and let's have dinner.

640
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,020
Mother, I'm not eating.

641
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,420
I've already had my meal.

642
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,080
I want to go for a walk.

643
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,320
What about the seafood feast?

644
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,880
Why is he not back yet?

645
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,969
Will he take it too hard?

646
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,530
He won't.

647
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,560
He's not that foolish.

648
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,810
I can't look at you now.

649
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,330
But we can't stay apart forever, right?

650
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,700
I'm sorry, miss.

651
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,200
I'm sorry, miss.

652
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,600
What are you looking at?

653
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,490
I'm not punishing her.

654
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,740
I just don't know

655
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,320
how to speak to her.

656
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,850
What do you want me to do then?

657
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,080
It's not her fault as well.

658
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,680
Also,

659
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,180
I didn't ask her to

660
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,360
wait me over there.

661
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,500
I told her

662
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,980
that I don't want to see her.

663
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,840
She insisted to stay there for me.

664
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,760
Can you blame me for it?

665
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,490
[What is she doing there?]

666
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,980
Doudou,

667
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,200
let's get back the mask from miss.

668
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,570
Miss, can you return

669
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,580
his mask?

670
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,800
Return me the mask.

671
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,610
Can you

672
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,460
lend it to me for a while longer?

673
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,370
No.

674
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,900
Nan Xing,

675
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,120
why are you wearing the mask?

676
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,220
I... I'm waiting for someone.

677
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,100
Who would wait for someone this way?

678
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,500
I know, you're waiting for Tang Sanzang.

679
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,900
Sun Wukong waits for Tang Sanzang.

680
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,760
Who is Tang Sanzang?

681
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,100
Tang Sanzang is...

682
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,000
Where is Tang Sanzang?

683
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,400
Master!
